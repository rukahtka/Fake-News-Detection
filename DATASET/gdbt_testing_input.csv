NATO launches Black Sea force as latest counter to Russia,"CRAIOVA, Romania (Reuters) - NATO launched a new multinational force in Romania on Monday to counter Russia along its eastern flank and to check a growing Russian presence in the Black Sea following the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of Crimea.
The force will initially be built around a Romanian brigade of up to 4,000 soldiers, supported by troops from nine other NATO countries, and complementing a separate deployment of 900 U.S. troops who are already in place. The plans are to include additional air and sea assets to give the force greater capabilities.
“Our purpose is peace, not war,” Romanian President Klaus Iohannis told the NATO Parliamentary Assembly of alliance lawmakers, which is meeting this year in Bucharest.
“We are not a threat for Russia. But we need dialogue from a strong position of defense and discouragement,” he said, before flying to the Craiova military base in south-eastern Romania.
At the base, as military bands played, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stood alongside Iohannis, addressed some of the troops in green face paint and inspected vehicles and weapons.
“We are sending a very clear message: NATO is here, NATO is strong and NATO is united,” Stoltenberg told assembled Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese soldiers.
Russia accuses NATO of trying to encircle it and threatening stability in Eastern Europe, which NATO denies. Around the Black Sea, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are NATO members while Georgia and Ukraine aspire to join.
The NATO force aims to develop its presence in the Black Sea region, rich in oil and gas, without escalating tensions as it seeks to counter Russia’s own plans to create what military analysts say is a “buffer zone”.
The 2008 Russian operation to put troops in Georgia’s South Ossetia region, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and its annexation of Crimea have raised the stakes, with all sides warning of a new, Cold-War style scenario.
Apart from Romania, Poland is the biggest troop contributor. Bulgaria, Italy and Portugal will train regularly with the force in Craiova, and Germany is also expected to contribute.
In additional to existing NATO Black Sea naval patrols, a maritime presence will include more allied visits to Romanian and Bulgarian ports, training and exercises.

‘WEST BERLIN’ MODEL
Some Eastern Europeans want NATO’s new ballistic missile defense shield, which includes a site in Romania, to be part of NATO’s eastern posture vis-a-vis Russia.

“The Aegis Ashore system would add another level of deterrence,” said Maciej Kowalski, an analyst at the Polish Casimir Pulaski Foundation, referring to the U.S.-built system.
NATO says the system is to intercept any Iranian rockets.
As in the Baltics and Poland, where the U.S.-led alliance has some 4,000 troops, NATO says the relatively light multinational model recalls allied support for West Berlin in the 1950s, when the presence of British, French and U.S. forces ensured the Soviet Union could not control all of Berlin.
Under NATO’s founding treaty, an attack on one ally is an attack on all, meaning all 28 NATO nations would be required to respond in the case of any potential Russian aggression.
While months in planning, the establishment of the force comes as Russia winds down its biggest war games since 2013. The Zapad, or West, games showed off Moscow’s latest weaponry and its ability to quickly mass forces on NATO’s borders.
The enhanced NATO presence in Romania and Bulgaria marks a diplomatic success for Bucharest, which gained greater persuasive power because it is set to reach a NATO goal of spending 2 percent of economic output on defense this year, a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump.
Romania pushed for bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea for more than a year, but found its neighbor Bulgaria wary of provoking Russia.
Turkey supports only limited NATO reinforcements, concerned about breaking international rules limiting the scale of patrols in the Black Sea. Turkey has played down the extent of Russia’s militarization of Crimea, which NATO says involves deploying surface-to-air missiles and communications jamming equipment."
Usman Khawaja on struggles with racial sledging in Australian grade cricket,"Usman Khawaja has scored 1,728 runs in 24 Tests for Australia, including five centuries
Australia's Usman Khawaja says being racially abused as young players has stopped many overseas-born cricketers from playing for the country.
The 30-year-old, who was born in Pakistan, said such abuse culminated in him not supporting Australia teams.
""Getting sledged by opposition players and their parents was the norm,"" said Khawaja on the Players Voice website.
""Some of them said it just quietly enough for only me to hear. It still hurt, but I would never show it.""
Khawaja became the first Muslim to play Test cricket for Australia when he made his debut against England in 2011. He has scored 1,728 runs in 24 Tests, including five centuries.
""I was brought up to be respectful, humble and polite. But when I watched the Aussie team, I saw men who were hard-nosed, confident, almost brutish,"" he continued.
""The same type of men who would sledge me about my heritage growing up.
""It is for this reason why so many of my friends, most of whom were born outside Australia, didn't support Australia in sporting contests. I didn't either.""
He added: ""My point is this: it's no surprise it has taken Australia cricket so long for coloured players to come through the system.""
Khawaja, who was the only Asian at first-class level in Australia when he began playing for New South Wales, added that the situation has improved because ""youngsters are given a bit more support to nurture and grow as players"". He said this is ""paving the way for all cricketers from all ethnic, religious and socio-economic backgrounds"".
His article ended: ""Australian cricket is slowly changing and will finally have a chance to reflect what Australia really is - an international team truly representative of its richly diverse population."""

China offers support to Spanish government amid Catalonia crisis,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China understands and supports the Spanish government’s efforts to protect the country’s unity and territorial integrity, China’s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, amid moves by Catalonia to declare independence.
The wealthy region’s intention to break away has plunged Spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, with Madrid threatening to sack the Catalan government if it goes ahead.
China was paying close attention, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing.
China “understands and supports the Spanish government’s efforts to protect national unity ... and its territorial integrity,” Hua said.
China believes Spain has the ability to guarantee social order and people’s interests in accordance with the law, she added.
China says it adheres to a policy of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, but it generally takes a dim view of independence or secessionist movements around the world.
At home, it contends with what it says are separatist movements in its western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, and also insists that the self-ruled island of Taiwan belongs to China.
Though it generally remains officially agnostic on such issues abroad, Beijing has expressed more openness toward independence votes when both sides have agreed to them, such as Scotland’s unsuccessful 2014 referendum to leave the United Kingdom, and South Sudan’s 2011 vote in favor of independence from Sudan."
"Trump seeks border wall, crackdown on unaccompanied minors for 'Dreamer' deal","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to help protect young people known as “Dreamers” brought illegally to the United States as children, called on Sunday for money to fund a border wall to be part of any immigration deal.
In a list of “principles” laid out in documents released by the White House, the Trump administration also pressed for a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the United States, many of them from Central America.
The plan, which was delivered to leaders in Congress on Sunday night, drew a swift rebuke from Democrats, who are seeking a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that Trump ended last month.
“The administration can’t be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,” said House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.
“The list includes the wall, which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations. If the president was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so,” they said in a statement.
The Trump administration wants the wish list to guide immigration reform in Congress and accompany a bill to replace DACA, the Obama-era program that protected nearly 800,000 “Dreamers” from deportation and allowed them to secure work permits.
If enacted, the White House priorities could result in the deportation of Dreamers’ parents.
Related Coverage Democrats rule out Trump's request for border wall funding in help for 'Dreamers'
The proposals emphasize immigration enforcement and include a request for funds to hire 370 more immigration judges, 1,000 attorneys for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, 300 federal prosecutors and 10,000 additional ICE agents to enforce immigration laws.
“These priorities are essential to mitigate the legal and economic consequences of any grant of status to DACA recipients,” Trump’s legislative affairs director, Marc Short, told reporters on a conference call. The White House made clear it would not be pushing for Dreamers to achieve U.S. citizenship, only legal status, in a potential deal.
Trump told Congress it had six months to come up with legislation to help Dreamers, who are a fraction of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of whom are Hispanic.
The documents call for tighter standards for those seeking U.S. asylum, denial of federal grants to “sanctuary cities” that serve as refuges for illegal immigrants, and a requirement that employers use an electronic verification system known as “E-Verify” to keep illegal immigrants from securing jobs.

HARD LINE
Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He vowed repeatedly that Mexico would pay for the wall, but began prodding Congress earlier this year to approve funding. Mexico has said it will not pay for the wall.
Trump’s suggestion after a meeting with Schumer and Pelosi that wall funding would not have to be part of a DACA fix alarmed some of his supporters.
The White House sees the wall as a priority but has indicated that it could be established as part of a DACA bill or through other legislative avenues. Administration officials said that legislation that did not include all of the priorities on the list would not necessarily trigger a presidential veto.
Republicans in Congress have introduced several bills that include aspects of Trump’s ideas, but many Democrats and immigration groups see the proposals as too harsh.
“The Trump administration has put forth a serious proposal to address the enforcement of our immigration laws and border security,“ said Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte in a statement. ”We cannot fix the DACA problem without fixing all of the issues that led to the underlying problem of illegal immigration in the first place.”
The White House’s wish list targets the flow of unaccompanied minors into the United States. It would require such children to be treated the same, regardless of their countries of origin “so long as they are not victims of human trafficking and can be safely returned home or removed to safe third countries,” the White House documents said.
It would expand the list of “inadmissible aliens” to include members of gangs, those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and former spouses and children of drug and human traffickers if they receive benefits from such behavior.
The plan also seeks to reduce the number of people who overstay their visas and reform how green cards that establish legal permanent residents are granted.
Trump’s White House has so far not been able to achieve a major legislative victory, casting doubt on the potential for a breakthrough on immigration reform, which Republican and Democratic presidents have tried before without success.
Since Trump took office in January, his fellow Republicans have failed to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and a White House plan for tax reform needs more support.

(Before It's News)
On Sunday I was in attendance when the Ravens took on the Jaguars at Wembley Stadium. There was a buzz in the air – the excitement of taking in a game on foreign soil and meeting Europeans from all over the continent who had a rooting interest in the game.
It was different than any game I’ve ever experienced and as I stood for the playing of our national anthem, with my hat proudly fixed atop my heart, I hung on every syllable sung beautifully by Noah Stewart. My eyes glistened with tears of joy, the byproduct of pride for my country and the many blessings bestowed upon me by so many others who enabled this unforgettable moment.
I stared at the colors of our flag as it hung from the rafters of Wembley.
And I smiled.
But the smile didn’t last long.
Shortly after the playing of the UK’s national anthem, “God Save The Queen”, I started receiving text messages from friends back in the States who were outraged by several Ravens taking a knee during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, something I failed to notice from my seat.
The mood changed dramatically, and the Ravens did nothing on the field to reverse the rapidly sinking feeling. All that seemed so magical just moments before was gone with a communal bend of the knee.
The protests were heard loud and clear. The game suddenly seemed unimportant. The division of a nation took precedent.
We can rationally debate the merits of the protest, but we seemingly prefer to argue irrationally.
The purpose of any protest is to call attention to something that an individual or group takes exception to. To this extent, the protests across the NFL were successful. But once the attention is achieved and issue at hand is defined and brought to the forefront, the goal should be to resolve differences – to see something through the eyes of an adversary in order to realize an acceptable compromise that benefits all parties.
Unfortunately, at least for the moment, the protests have exacerbated the issues and the divisiveness is more pronounced. Both sides are throwing fuel on the fire, lost in the cause instead of defining solutions.
This is a time when leaders on both sides need to lead. They need to step up for the greater good and seek solutions, together. Stubbornness or escalation of commitment won’t get us there. Isn’t that already obvious?
Football is a game we all love. It’s a pastime – an opportunity to forget about the things that trouble us for 3 hours on a Sunday. It is an opportunity to come together as one for something that we, as a community, have in common.
I remember when the Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV and the celebrations that followed in Baltimore. “Our” team won and we rejoiced like nobody’s business – TOGETHER! It was reported that during that celebratory night on January 28, 2001 that only one arrest was made in the city of Baltimore. ONE! A misdemeanor.
That’s what sports teams can do. They can galvanize a community. And those teams are enabled by the freedoms we enjoy as American citizens – freedoms symbolized by our flag.
We’ve overcome bigger issues in the past.
Let’s not let foolish pride stand in our way.
Together we can fix this.
We owe that to those who sacrificed so much for their country.
Our country…

Smart Meter Data: Privacy and Cybersecurity,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
In February of 2012, three attorneys with the Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a lengthy report “Smart Meter Data: Privacy and Cybersecurity,” which addressed many of the same questions consumers have about those high-tech utility meters being forced on to customers’ electric, natural gas and water utility services in every state and globally. I’ve read the entire report and think consumers ought to know the more significant parts and information regarding your rights to privacy and security.
The CRS is a government agency basically providing background information about certain issues or topics members of Congress or congressional committees want to know more about.
Nothing is a “hot button” privacy and health issue more than AMI Smart Meters, which are retrofitted in place of safe analog meters that have been in exemplary use for decades. The new AMI SMs have one advantage over the safe analog meters, which probably appeals to the United Nations: AMI SMs spy on the occupants inside the homes to which AMI SMs are retrofitted. Those personal rights violations are real and should be of valid concern to consumers who know their U.S. Constitutional and State Constitutional rights are being violated and abrogated.
Apparently, those same issues may have been on the minds of some members of Congress, therefore, the request for a Privacy and Cybersecurity Report.
In the Summary of that report, we find
Fueled by stimulus funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), electric utilities have accelerated their deployment of smart meters to millions of homes across the United States with help from the Department of Energy’s Smart Grid Investment Grant program. As the meters multiply, so do issues concerning the privacy and security of the data collected by the new technology. This Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) promises to increase energy efficiency, bolster electric power grid reliability, and facilitate demand response, among other benefits. However, to fulfill these ends, smart meters must record near-real time data on consumer electricity usage and transmit the data to utilities over great distances via communications networks that serve the smart grid. Detailed electricity usage data offers a window into the lives of people inside of a home by revealing what individual appliances they are using, and the transmission of the data potentially subjects this information to interception or theft by unauthorized third parties or hackers. [CJF emphasis]
Rather nonchalantly, in this writer’s opinion, the Report’s authors concede:
Unforeseen consequences under federal law may result from the installation of smart meters and the communications technologies that accompany them. This report examines federal privacy and cybersecurity laws that may apply to consumer data collected by residential smart meters. It begins with an examination of the constitutional provisions in the Fourth Amendment that may apply to the data. As we progress into the 21st century, access to personal data, including information generated from smart meters, is a new frontier for police investigations. The Fourth Amendment generally requires police to have probable cause to search an area in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, courts have used the third-party doctrine to deny protection to information a customer gives to a business as part of their commercial relationship. This rule is used by police to access bank records, telephone records, and traditional utility records. Nevertheless, there are several core differences between smart meters and the general third-party cases that may cause concerns about its application. These include concerns expressed by the courts and Congress about the ability of technology to potentially erode individuals’ privacy. If smart meter data and transmissions fall outside of the protection of the Fourth Amendment, they may still be protected from unauthorized disclosure or access under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). These statutes, however, would appear to permit law enforcement to access smart meter data for investigative purposes under procedures provided in the SCA, ECPA, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), subject to certain conditions. Additionally, an electric utility’s privacy and security practices with regard to consumer data may be subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has recently focused its consumer protection enforcement on entities that violate their privacy policies or fail to protect data from unauthorized access. This authority could apply to electric utilities in possession of smart meter data, provided that the FTC has statutory jurisdiction over them. General federal privacy safeguards provided under the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 (FPA) protect smart meter data maintained by federal agencies, including data held by federally owned electric utilities. [CJF emphasis]
How come state public utility commissions, their kangaroo courts and utility companies’ attorneys aren’t held accountable to the legitimate seriousness of the above constitutional issues, let alone the escalating adverse health effects from AMI Smart Meter radiofrequencies non-thermal radiation waves that now scientifically have been proven to break DNA bonds?
On page 2 of that Report, the CRS lawyers say,
General federal privacy safeguards provided under the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 (FPA) protect smart meter data maintained by federal agencies, including data held by federally owned electric utilities. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) allows the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to bring enforcement proceedings against electric utilities that violate their privacy policies or fail to protect meter data from unauthorized access, provided that the FTC has statutory jurisdiction over the utilities. It is unclear how Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizures would apply to smart meter data, due to the lack of cases on this issue. However, depending upon the manner in which smart meter services are presented to consumers, smart meter data may be protected from unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). If smart meter data is protected by these statutes, law enforcement would still appear to have the ability to access it for investigative purposes under procedures provided in the SCA, ECPA, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). [CJF emphasis]
Page 3 addresses Smart Meter Data: Privacy and Security Concerns
Residential smart meters present privacy and cybersecurity issues 19 that are likely to evolve with the technology.20 In 2010, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published a report identifying some of these issues, which fall into two main categories: (1) privacy concerns that smart meters will reveal the activities of people inside of a home by measuring their electricity usage frequently over time;21and (2) fears that inadequate cybersecurity measures surrounding the digital transmission of smart meter data will expose it to misuse by authorized and unauthorized users of the data. [CJF emphasis]
While addressing specific details, the Report claims
Smart meters offer a significantly more detailed illustration of a consumer’s energy usage than regular meters. Traditional meters display data on a consumer’s total electricity usage and are typically read manually once per month.23 In contrast, smart meters can provide near real-time usage data by measuring usage electronically at a much greater frequency, such as once every 15 minutes.24 Current smart meter technology allows utilities to measure usage as frequently as once every minute.25 By examining smart meter data, it is possible to identify which appliances a consumer is using and at what times of the day, because each type of appliance generates a unique electric load “signature.”26 [which will tie into the Internet of Things.] NIST wrote in 2010 that ?“research shows that analyzing 15-minute interval aggregate household energy consumption data can by itself pinpoint the use of most major home appliances.?” 27 A report for the Colorado Public Utilities Commission discussed an Italian study that used “artificial neural networks” to identify individual “heavy-load appliance uses” with 90% accuracy using 15-minute interval data from a smart meter.28 Similarly, software-based algorithms would likely allow a person to extract the unique signatures of individual appliances from meter data that has been collected less frequently and is therefore less detailed.29 [One algorithm program is “ONZO” (2).] By combining appliance usage patterns, an observer could discern the behavior of occupants in a home over a period of time.30 For example, the data could show whether a residence is occupied, how many people live in it, and whether it is “occupied by more people than usual.”31 According to the Department of Energy, smart meters may be able to reveal occupants’ “daily schedules (including times when they are at or away from home or asleep), whether their homes are equipped with alarm systems, whether they own expensive electronic equipment such as plasma TVs, and whether they use certain types of medical equipment.”32 Figure 1, which appears in NIST’s report on smart grid cybersecurity, shows how smart meter data could be used to decipher the activities of a home’s occupants by matching data on their electricity usage with known appliance load signatures. [CJF emphasis]
Here is the part about AMI SMs that really needs to be understood and factored in to the privacy and security paradigm the microwave industry, utility companies and even state public utility commissions, which should know better, are not paying attention to nor dealing with: Potential for Theft or Breach of Data, like we had with the Equifax data breach affecting about half of the country’s consumers.
Increased Potential for Theft or Breach of Data Smart grid technology relies heavily on two-way communication to increase energy efficiency and reliability, including communication between smart meters and the utility (or other entity) that stores data for the grid.46 Many different technologies will transmit data to the grid, including ?“traditional twisted-copper phone lines, cable lines, fiber optic cable, cellular, satellite, microwave, WiMAX, power line carrier, and broadband over power line.?”47 Of these communications platforms, wireless technologies are likely to play a ?“prominent role?” because they present fewer safety concerns and cost less to implement than wireline technologies.48 According to the Department of Energy, a typical utility network has four “tiers?” that collect and transmit data from the consumer to the utility.49 These include “(1) the core backbone—the primary path to the utility data center; (2) backhaul distribution—the aggregation point for neighborhood data; (3) the access point—typically the smart meter; and, (4) the HAN—the home network.”50 Energy usage data moves from the smart meter,51 and then to an “aggregation point” outside of the residence such as “a substation, a utility pole-mounted device, or a communications tower.?”52 [CJF emphasis]
Two U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Kyllo v United States [1] and United States v Karo, have defended “the home as a sacred site at the core of the Fourth Amendment.”
Kyllo and Karo demonstrate that the Supreme Court “has defended the home as a sacred site at the ‘core of the Fourth Amendment.’?”169 Although neither the Supreme Court nor any lower federal court has ruled on the use of smart meters, a few propositions can be deduced from Kyllo and Karo bearing on this question. Because smart meters allow law enforcement to access information regarding intimate details occurring inside the home, a highly invasive investigation that could not otherwise be performed without intrusion into the home, a court may require a warrant to access this data. In Kyllo, the police merely obtained the relative temperatures of a house,170 and in Karo the police only generally located the beeper in the house.171 Although this information was limited, the Court nonetheless prohibited such investigatory techniques. Smart meters have the potential to produce significantly more information than that derived in Kyllo and Karo, including what individual appliances we are using; whether our house is empty or occupied; and when we take our daily shower or bath.172 Further, a look at Figure 1, supra, makes it clear that this level of information is much more intimate than prior technologies used by law enforcement. This depth of intrusion suggests that customers may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in smart meter data. [CJF emphasis]
The CRS lawyers thought there is/was Statutory Protection of Smart Meter Data!
Question: Which law school courses did they take that utility company lawyers and public utility commissions judges somehow missed during law school?
This section discusses federal statutory protections that may be applicable to the contents of communications sent by a smart meter, independent of the Fourth Amendment, while they are either stored within the smart meter prior to transmission, during transmission, or after they have been delivered to the utility. Three federal laws, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA),199 the Stored Communications Act (SCA),200 and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)201 may be applicable to these situations and are discussed in more detail below. [CJF emphasis]
How come public utility commission administrative law judges don’t recognize those federal laws, enforce them from the bench and in their decisions by automatically ruling in favor of consumers who reject AMI SMs? Good question?
Since AMI SMs basically are sophisticated computers that will have to be replaced every five to six years with updated meters, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act may be applied to AMI SMs privacy issues:
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) prohibits intentionally accessing and obtaining information from a computer used in or affecting interstate commerce, without authorization or in excess of a granted authorization.246 The definition of a computer for purposes of the CFAA is “an electronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device” excluding “an automated typewriter or typesetter, a portable hand held calculator, or other similar device….?”247 The servers on a utility’s network would likely fall squarely within the definition of a computer under the CFAA. Similarly, smart meters themselves also appear to meet the definition of a computer, insofar as they store customers’ energy usage data and also perform logical operations by routing transmissions across the utility’s network. Additionally, in light of the significant role that energy utilities play in the modern economy, the smart meter network would also likely be considered to have an effect on interstate commerce, even if they operate entirely within one state. Therefore, intentionally gaining access to the utility’s servers or smart meters to obtain customer data would likely constitute a violation of the CFAA if done without the utility’s authorization or in excess of an authorization granted by the utility. [CJF emphasis]
Here’s a nice part about the CFAA: the fines, which should be incentive enough for everyone to file complaints against utility companies with their state Attorney General or state public utility commission:
The criminal penalties for violating the unauthorized access provisions of the CFAA have a three tier sentencing structure. Simple violations are punished as misdemeanors, imprisonment for not more than one year and/or a fine of not more than $100,000 ($200,000 for organizations).248
Another law that comes into play is Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce”251 and gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) jurisdiction to bring enforcement actions against “persons, partnerships, or corporations” that engage in these practices.252 In the past, the FTC has used its authority under Section 5 to take action against businesses that violate their own privacy policies or that fail to adequately safeguard a consumer’s personal information.253 Although there do not appear to be any cases in which the FTC has taken action against an electric utility for failing to protect consumer smart meter data, the Commission would have authority to enforce Section 5 against a utility that fell within its statutory jurisdiction.
On page 40 of the Report, the lawyers mention another issue that can be relevant:
“Unfair” Failure to Secure Consumer Data Failure to Protect Against Common Technology Threats or Unauthorized Access The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) The FTC may consider it an “unfair” practice when an electric utility fails to safeguard smart meter data from well-known technology threats as the data travels across the utility’s communications networks. [CJF emphasis]
Furthermore and even more importantly, all parties involved in the AMI SM legal debacles must realize what the CRS lawyers have to say about AMI SM data protection:
Smart Meter Data as a Protected “Record”
The Privacy Act protects the type of electricity usage data gathered by smart meters, provided that the data pertains to U.S. citizens or permanent residents, is personally identifiable, and is retrievable by the individual’s name or another personal identifier. The Privacy Act “governs the collection, use, and dissemination of a ‘record’ about an ‘individual’ maintained by federal agencies in a ‘system of records.’?”368 Under the statute, a “record” is “any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency … that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph.?”369 An “individual” is defined as “a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.?”370 A “system of records” is “a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual” or other personal identifier “assigned to the individual.”371 Smart meter data held by an agency certainly fits within the broad definition of a “record” because it is a grouping of information about an individual, namely, data on that individual’s electricity usage. The data is typically stored along with a consumer’s account information, which usually includes a consumer’s name, social security number, or other “identifying particular.”372 Thus, smart meter data would constitute a protected “record” under the Privacy Act, assuming that it pertains to a citizen of the United States or lawful permanent resident and is retrievable by a personal identifier such as a consumer’s name or account number.

All the above only confirms why The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58) Section 1252 Smart Metering does not mandate or make AMI Smart Meters mandatory. That would be unconstitutional, yet public utility commissions don’t respect the foremost law of the land, the U.S. Constitution.
Apparently, there is a copy of a Member of Congress letter circulating on the Internet wherein that Congressperson says “As you may know, provisions within the 2005 Energy Policy Act allow for consumers to opt out of smart meter programs that are run at the state level.”
This Writer’s Comment:
Since the Equifax credit bureau hacking ‘tragedy’, plus other numerous privacy, security and identity theft problems with computers, credit card companies and corporations that manage them, one would think state agencies, in particular, should be determined to protect consumers’ constitutional rights to privacy and personal data, and not provide opportunities for personal data to be compromised from cyberattacks, especially since utility companies definitely will not be sending consumers’ data over secure networks!

Indian PM Modi targets more energy reforms after meeting oil chiefs,"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestures as he addresses a gathering during the groundbreaking ceremony for a high-speed rail project in Ahmedabad, India, September 14, 2017. REUTERS/Amit Dave
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s prime minister sees scope for further reform of the country’s energy sector and has received “focused suggestions” from some of the world’s leading energy companies, the office of the premier said on Monday.

Executives from companies including Rosneft, BP, Exxon Mobil, Reliance Industries, Saudi Aramco, Royal Dutch Shell, Vedanta, Schlumberger and Halliburton met Modi as the industry gathered in New Delhi for the three-day India Energy Forum, which finishes on Tuesday.
“Participants appreciated the pace and drive with which Prime Minister Modi has brought about reform in the energy sector,” Modi’s office said in a statement after the meeting.
“Subjects such as the need for a unified energy policy, contract frameworks and arrangements, requirement of seismic data sets, encouragement for biofuels, improving gas supply, setting up of a gas hub and regulatory issues came up for discussion.”
The statement said that many suggestions at the last meeting in 2016 have helped guide Indian policy-making and that Modi said he appreciated the “focused suggestions” made this year and that “scope for reform in many areas still exists”.
Modi was quoted as saying he looked forward to “various opportunities” for cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia, the second biggest oil exporter to the country behind Iraq.
State-run Saudi Aramco, which on Sunday launched a new office near New Delhi, is in talks with several Indian refiners for a possible joint venture by next year.
Its Chief Executive Amin Nasser told the conference after the Modi meeting that India’s oil demand would double by 2040 to about 10 million barrels per day, making it the world’s largest market for the fuel and a priority for the company.
In the meeting, Modi thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Rosneft for their support to India’s energy sector. The two leaders were instrumental in helping to seal Rosneft’s $12.9 billion acquisition of India’s debt-laden Essar Oil, strengthening ties between the world’s largest oil producer and the fastest-growing fuel consumer.
In another vote of confidence for India’s energy sector, BP and Reliance have previously said they would jointly invest $6 billion to boost India’s gas output. A BP executive said on Monday that the company was “excited about gas, upstream and digital innovation in India”.
Alay Patel, a senior analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the global president of which also met Modi, said that India’s domestic energy production outlook was positive thanks to steps such as a simplified licensing regime and clarity on contracts.
“But more is needed,” said Patel. “Allowing marketing and pricing freedom for all gas production, regardless of shore status and contract vintage, would incentivize companies to develop gas in the less explored basins.”"
Claudia Fragapane wins World Gymnastics bronze in Montreal,"Media playback is not supported on this device Fragapane wins floor bronze
Great Britain's Claudia Fragapane won a world bronze medal in the floor at the World Gymnastics Championships in Montreal on Sunday.
The 19 year-old scored 13.933 behind Japan's winner, Mai Murakami (14.233), and Jade Carey of the USA (14.2).
""It's absolutely incredible, I can't believe I have a bronze medal round my neck,"" Fragapane - who won four 2014 Commonwealth golds - told BBC Sport.
""All the hurt from missing the Olympic final has gone away. I'm so happy.""
Fragapane is the first British woman to win an individual world medal since Beth Tweddle won uneven bars gold in 2010.
Competing fifth out of the eighth finalists, Fragapane dropped marks after a messy landing on her first tumble pass.
Only just managing to avoid stepping out of the floor she then recomposed herself to finish strongly.

Her maiden individual medal was confirmed when the last gymnast, Vanessa Ferrari, had to abandon her routine after an awkward landing.
""I was so angry after that landing and I was determined to get through to the end cleanly,"" said Fragapane.
The result means GB's gymnasts leave Canada with two world medals, after Max Whitlock took pommel gold on Saturday."
Freedom Exists Under Natural Law,"By Rosanne Lindsay
To know freedom is to know Nature. Living in harmony with Nature leads to peace, prosperity, knowledge, truth, action, and freedom. Nature reflects the order of the universe. Living in opposition to Nature leads to war, control, ignorance, fear, stagnation, and enslavement.
Today, America, The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, finds herself in shackles and homeless. The foundation of American freedom is cracked. New restrictive mandates form the walls of a prison cell which we have built through our own apathy and ignorance. The original Charters of Freedom: The United States Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and The Declaration of Independence were written to reflect Inherent Rights of the individual. Yet these documents are being ignored by the very government created to uphold them because, by themselves, they are only metaphorical shields.
Why are we losing freedom?
Because we have forgotten where our rights come from. Human rights are natural and inborn, granted by the Creator. They come from our humanity under the Laws of Nature. Natural Law and Justice is, and always has been, the primary fundamental force in the universe. It is a body of Universal Spiritual Laws which governs Consciousness. Consciousness creates through each of us using free will. We are consciousness.
We have stopped taking action to secure freedom. We thought that when we created government in America as a Constitutional Republic, individuals would be recognized to hold certain inalienable rights; rights which are not transferable and which can never be revoked, regardless of what the majority wants, or who holds power. However what we have agreed to is a Democracy.
A Republic is where the people control the government. A Democracy, is where the Government controls the people.
When Rights Are Legalized
Rights granted and legalized by governments are not rights at all. In fact, they are privileges that can be altered restricted, and taken away by legislation or Executive Orders.
These privileges are codified (codes) in legalese. Legalese is the language of statutes, which redefines words as tools to expand the scope and power of the State. Under statutes, a “person” is a legal fiction, not a human being with free will. At the same time, a “corporation” is defined as “a number of persons united in one body, so it can acquire wealth, expand, and enjoy other rights.” Note: a corporation is incapable of loyalty or love. Governments also regulate behavior through licensure. A license is permission to do something otherwise deemed to be illegal.
A government that gives itself power by its own authority is a rogue government and must be restrained, or else the trend is toward a concentration of power where laws are homogenized and standardized to one-opinion rule -a monarchy. Unless we can wake ourselves up, the United Nations (UN) International treaties (UNCRC), intend to “reduce inequality” by implementing new norms of global socialism and corporate fascism as part of their Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals.
What is Freedom?
To go to the next level in human evolution is to return more deeply into Nature. That is where freedom lives. Freedom is our ability to:
express without limits,
to seek truth and understanding,
to access the foods of our choice,
to choose what we allow into our bodies and our minds,
to grow our own foods and plant medicines,
to speak our truth,
to raise children without government interference,
to choose love instead of fear,
to choose healing over treatment,
to embody and integrate the Charters of Freedom,
to claim responsibility for individual choices, and the consequences of those choices.
How few of us have made our individual declaration of independence, and until we do that, we are not free.– Edwin Manners
The American Declaration of Independence reminds us,
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
When governments ignore the will of the people and “go rogue” for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many, it is time to remember from where true freedom comes. Our system derives from our free will and consent.
The Polarity Principle
There are two belief systems representing the polarity existing on Planet Earth. Under the Polarity Principle everything has poles or pairs of opposite charge:
One belief system says that a human being is separate from all others, designed to control others when they cannot or do not reason for themselves. This belief derives from man-made written codes that must be learned.
Another belief system says that each human is a cell of the collective web, and that all humans are connected as one entity, one interconnected humanity. This belief derives from Natural Law. Natural Law is not written, but intuitive and knowable by simple observation, reason, common sense, and deduction. ‘By your action, ye shall be known.’
On a free-will planet, everything is presented as an offer to contract and it is always up to each of us to consent or to withdraw consent. Silence is acquiescence. Ignorance of the law is no excuse in the Age of Information.
Legal Vs. Lawful
There is a difference between legal and lawful. Legal pertains to the letter of law, whereas lawful pertains to the spirit of law. Legal matters reflect statutes between government entities and the color of law (i.e., the appearance or semblance, without the substance), whereas lawful matters reflect common law, the law of the land—the law of the people—and are actual in nature, not implied. Going forward, if we are to be free, we must resist playing a game of wits in a corrupt system that seeks to destroy Inherent Rights.
Instead, we must take back the language and determine who we are. Are we a “person-corporation” or a soul embodied? Do we have free-will or do we ask for permission from an outside authority? Do we consent to the dictates of a rogue government or do we withdraw consent? Do we own our bodies or does the State? Do we recognize inalienable rights and act on them? Do we reclaim our sovereignty as free-will beings? It is time to redefine the words we live by to work in our favor.
Wire Tapped America - New Free Book (Ad) True Freedom for all should be seen as the goal of Spiritual development. Such a state can only manifest as a result of human society’s adherence to Natural Law. – Mark Passio, Natural Law, the Real Law of Attraction
Follow Intuition
As part of nature, we must connect to Nature to experience freedom. As Within So Without. When we follow government dictates as truth, we lose touch with our own intuition. We lose connection with our true nature. As long as we remain distracted, debating the details of the system (war, mandates, rigged elections, the NFL, science, abortion, self-identification), we are directionless, lost in a maze of confusion. By consenting to a system of contradictions through our participation and acceptance, the system feeds off our energy.
If America is held up as an example of Freedom to the rest of the world, we must get our act together and identify with Natural Law. Through the power of our vision we become the architect of the life we want to create for ourselves and for our families. We only need to reclaim responsibility and act on it in order to see it emanate out to affect all life. Such is the Law of Nature.
In the American system no government is sovereign. The peoples of the states are the sovereigns. It is they who apportion powers between themselves, their state governments, and the federal government. In doing so they are not impairing their sovereignty in any way. To the contrary, they are exercising it.” – Tom Woods, Tenth Amendment Center

Jailed British-Iranian charity worker faces new charges: family,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her daughter Gabriella pose for a photo in London, Britain February 7, 2016. Picture taken February 7, 2016. Karl Brandt/Courtesy of Free Nazanin campaign/Handout via REUTERS
LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian authorities have opened a new case against a British-Iranian charity worker serving five years in jail in Tehran, leveling charges that could carry a sentence of 16 additional years in prison, her family said on Monday.
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested by the elite Revolutionary Guards in April 2016 at a Tehran airport, as she was about to return to Britain with her two-year-old daughter after a family visit.
She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. She was sentenced to five years in prison.
In a hearing in Evin Prison, where she is serving her term, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was told on Sunday that a new case had been opened at the insistence of the Revolutionary Guards, Iran’s most powerful security force, her family said in a statement.
The new charges include joining and receiving money from organizations working to overthrow the Islamic Republic, and attending a demonstration outside the Iranian Embassy in London, the family said.
“Nazanin and the rest of her family are bewildered at this turn,” the family statement said.
Her husband Richard Ratcliffe said the Revolutionary Guards were “inventing new charges to prevent her early release”.
Iran’s judiciary was not immediately available for comment.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe used to work in London for the BBC, which Iran says is seeking to topple the Islamic theocracy. During Sunday’s hearing she rejected all the new charges, the family said.
Iran refuses to recognize dual nationals and denies them access to consular assistance.
On the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September, Britain’s foreign minister, Boris Johnson, said progress in the relationship between London and Tehran would depend to some extent on a resolution of the Nazanin case.

Russians' lawyer says new documents show Trump Tower meeting not about Clinton,"(CNN) An attorney for the Russian billionaire who allegedly pushed for the June 2016 meeting between senior members of Trump's team and a Russian lawyer says he has documents showing the meeting wasn't really about dirt on Hillary Clinton.
The new information stands in contrast with the initial email pitching the meeting to Trump Jr., which promised damaging information on Clinton.
The emails provided to CNN between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and publicist Rob Goldstone -- who arranged the meeting with Trump Jr. -- show Veselnitskaya asked the morning of the meeting for a Russian-American lobbyist to be added because of his knowledge of the Magnitsky Act, the legislation that put in place US sanctions discussed at the meeting.
And a five-page talking points memo also provided to CNN shows Veselnitskaya's case to repeal the Magnitsky Act to improve US-Russia relations, with a passing reference to a possible financer of Clinton's campaign.
The June 2016 meeting with Trump Jr., President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has attracted intense interest because Trump Jr. was told he would get damaging information on Clinton amid allegations of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.
The documents were provided by Scott Balber, who represents Aras and Emin Agalarov, the billionaire real estate developer and his pop star son who requested the June 2016 meeting.
Balber, who went to Moscow to obtain the documents from Veselnitskaya, said in an interview with CNN that the emails and talking points show she was focused on repealing the Magnitsky Act, not providing damaging information on Clinton.
The message was muddled, Balber said, when it was passed like a game of telephone from Veselnitskaya through the Agalarovs to Goldstone.
Balber also suggested that Goldstone ""probably exaggerated and maybe willfully contorted the facts for the purpose of making the meeting interesting to the Trump people.""
Goldstone declined to comment for this story.
""The documents and what she told me are consistent with my client's understanding of the purpose of the meeting which was from the beginning and at all times thereafter about her efforts to launch a legislative review of the Magnitsky Act,"" Balber said.
The emails between Goldstone and Trump Jr. tell a different story.
In the email exchange between Goldstone and Trump Jr., which was made public earlier this year, Goldstone wrote: ""The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.""
""I love it,"" Trump Jr. responded.
Goldstone, a music publicist who worked on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with the Trump family, has said after the meeting was disclosed that he was exaggerating to Trump Jr. to secure the meeting.
Balber also provided CNN with new details about a phone call between Trump Jr. and Emin Agalarov after Goldstone initially emailed Trump Jr. and before the meeting took place. Balber says that ""Emin remembers vaguely some brief call saying, 'Look, I know Goldstone is emailing you if you can do this, that would be great.' But Emin doesn't remember anything substantive discussed."" Trump Jr. said in a recently released statement that phone records show three brief phone calls or voicemail exchanges with Emin Agalarov but that he had no memory of speaking with him.
Trump Jr. has said Veselnitskaya started the meeting talking about ""individuals connected to Russia"" funding Clinton but provided no details to support her claims and then moved on to focus on the US sanctions under the Magnitsky Act and the adoption of Russian children.
""To the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,"" Trump Jr. said in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
But the meeting between the Russian lawyer and Trump Jr. has become of significant interest to the congressional Russia investigators. And President Trump's role in drafting his son's misleading initial statement — which claimed the meeting was about Russian adoptions — has prompted special counsel Robert Mueller's team to approach the White House about interviewing staffers aboard Air Force One when the statement was drafted.
Non-disclosure agreements signed
The emails between Veselnitskaya and Goldstone also add intriguing new details into the genesis of the meeting.
In the exchange the morning of the meeting, Veselnitskaya asked Goldstone if Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin could be brought along, saying he was ""working to advance these issues with several congressmen.""
Veselnitskaya also said that both Akhmetshin and her translator, Anatoli Samochornov, has signed non-disclosure agreements.
""Mr. Akhmetshin has signed an NDA with us as did Mr. Samochornov,"" she wrote.
It's not clear why they had signed the agreement. Typically, a non-disclosure agreement would be crafted by a lawyer for the participants to sign. Two sources familiar with the Trump campaign said NDAs were not common requirements for general meetings.
A person familiar with the Trump Organization said the organization, as well as Trump Jr., had no knowledge that NDAs were signed before the meeting by some of the participants.
The source said it was odd that a non-disclosure agreement would have been necessary for the meeting.
Akhmetshin's attorney, Michael Tremonte, said his client ""has no recollection of an NDA in connection with the meeting and was unaware of the communications between Veselnitskaya and Goldstone.""
Balber said Ike Kaveladze, an Agalarov representative who was the eighth person in the Trump Jr. meeting, did not sign a non-disclosure form.
Veselnitskaya did not answer CNN questions about why the forms were signed. The lawyer for Akhmetshin declined to comment.
Talking points
The five-page memo, marked confidential and dated May 30, 2016, accuses US lawmakers of falsifying the story of attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who was killed while in Russian custody in 2009. US lawmakers passed the Magnitsky Act in 2012 to punish the Russians allegedly responsible for his death.
As part of her explanation, Veselnitskaya's talking points accuse the ""Ziff brothers"" -- three billionaire brothers who had run a hedge fund company together -- of violating Russian law, as well as their connections to Democratic politics.
""Ziff brothers participated in financing both Obama presidential campaign, American press dubs them as 'main sponsors of Democrats,' "" the memo states, according to a translated version. ""It's entirely possible they also take part in financing Hillary Clinton's campaign.""
Ziff Brothers Investment spokesperson Michael Freitag declined to comment.
Update: This story has been updated with the Ziff brothers' spokesman declining to comment."

Bump stocks allowed Stephen Paddock, the Vegas gunman who killed 58 people and injured almost 500 more, to fire semi-automatic rifles at cyclic rates similar to fully automatic versions. Politicians’ and media’s fixation on the legal, for now, devices are creating a rush on them. Firearms distributors have run out of the devices as gun owners rush to buy them ahead of a possible ban on the easily-installed systems that can allow a semi-auto AR-15 to fire more than 500 rounds per minute. While machine guns are heavily regulated and require a lengthy paperwork and review process to obtain, the bump stock is an attachment that uses a gun’s recoil and the shooter’s shoulder to achieve rapid fire. Machine guns, for those who can even get them, can cost more than $20,000 while the bump stock systems regularly sell for between $90 and $300. An entire industry popped-up around these devices and its now seeing record demand. Bump Fire Systems’ website was down due to an overloaded server and a better-known maker of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, posted a notice on its website notifying customers that the company has stopped taking new orders as demand had outpaced their ability to manufacture.

"U.N. bans four ships over North Korea coal, U.S. delays four more","The flag of North Korea is seen in Geneva, Switzerland, June 20, 2017. REUTERS/Pierre Albouy
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council has banned four ships from ports globally for carrying coal from North Korea, including one vessel that also had ammunition, but the United States postponed a bid to blacklist four others pending further investigation.
The vessels are the first to be designated under stepped-up sanctions imposed on North Korea by the 15-member council in August and September over Pyongyang’s sixth and largest nuclear test and two long-range ballistic missile launches.
The Security Council North Korea sanctions committee, which operates by consensus, agreed at the request of the United States, to blacklist the ships on Oct. 3 for “transporting prohibited items from the DPRK” (North Korea), according to documents seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
A U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the four blacklisted ships and the four vessels still being investigated had been linked to illicit trade in North Korean coal. In November last year, the Security Council capped North Korean coal exports and then in August imposed a complete ban.
Related Coverage Trump, top defense officials, discuss North Korea options: White House
The 193 U.N. member states are now required to prohibit port entry to the Comoros-flagged Petrel 8, St. Kitts and Nevis-flagged Hao Fan 6, North Korean-flagged Tong San 2 and Cambodia-flagged Jie Shun. Entry is only allowed in case of emergency or if the vessel is returning to its home port.
The Jie Shun was intercepted by Egypt on Aug. 11, 2016, carrying 30,000 rocket propelled grenades in wooden crates concealed under about 2,300 tonnes of iron ore, according to U.N. sanctions monitors.
It was “the largest interdicted ammunition consignment in the history of sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” the independent sanctions monitors told the Security Council in their annual report in February.
The ship had left the North Korean port of Haeju on July 23, 2016, and was interdicted in Egyptian territorial waters south of the Suez Canal, the experts said.
North Korea is under a U.N. arms embargo and the Security Council has banned trade in exports such as coal, textiles, seafood, iron and other minerals to choke funding for Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear programs.
In an Oct. 3 note to the Security Council’s North Korea sanctions committee, seen by Reuters, the United States said it was withdrawing four ships it had proposed for listing - the South Korean-flagged Xin Shen Hai, the Palau-flagged East Glory 7, the Panama-flagged Kai Xiang and Cheng Hong.
“These four ships require further study with key parties and we will revert to the committee once that process is completed,” the U.S. mission to the United Nations wrote.
A ninth ship, the Fiji-flagged Toyo Maru, had been proposed for listing in an annex to the initial U.S. draft of a resolution adopted by the Security Council on Sept. 11. It was not clear if the United States still planned to put the ship forward for designation.
The U.N. Security Council has unanimously adopted nine sanctions resolutions on North Korea since 2006."
Atari Reveals First New Console in 24 Years: Introducing the Ataribox,"Atari hasn’t put together an official home console since the Jaguar launched in 1993. There have been various side-projects and plug-and-play one-offs, but now Atari is back in the game with a brand new console. Say hello to the Ataribox.
 
 
 
 
From the official update from Atari: “Our objective is to create a new product that stays true to our heritage while appealing to both old and new fans of Atari. Inspired by classic Atari design elements (such as the iconic use of wood, ribbed lines, and raised back); we are creating a smooth design, with ribs that flow seamlessly all around the body of the product, a front panel that can be either wood or glass, a front facing logo, indicator lights that glow through the material, and an array of new ports (HDMI, 4xUSB, SD). We intend to release two editions: a wood edition, and a black/red edition.”
 
It’s a pretty gorgeous box, to be sure. We really enjoy the neo-classic design; like something refurbished from the 80s to actually look presentable on a shelf next to sleek, modern designs from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. So… What is this thing actually going to do for you? Is this made to compete with consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo? Atari gave us another clue in its update.
 
 
Atari had to folllowing to say in its newsletter to fans: “As you can guess, those ports suggest modern internal specs. It also means that while we will be delivering classic gaming content, we will also be delivering current gaming content.”
 
So while this doesn’t sound like one of those plug-and-play toys you buy off of a Target shelf, it also doesn’t sound like Atari is attempting to make a current-gen competitor. This might be something in between; something where you can experience all of the best retro exclusives and ports that we associate with playing on Atari consoles. This may include games like Defender, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaxian, Solaris, and others.
 
The fact that they specifically mention “modern internal specs” and “current gaming content” is curious, though. Could we be dealing with an Android-based operating system that can play more modern mobile titles? After all, we’ve seen some killer mobile games lately that are based on some timeless classics. Games like Breakout and RollerCoaster Tycoon. We wouldn’t mind seeing those games on the Ataribox.
 
How powerful will it be?
 
 
We’re not quite sure yet. Other than the mention of modern specs and current games, Atari was incredibly ambiguous as to the Ataribox internals. They did acknowledge the tech heads, though:
 
“We know you are hungry for more details; on specs, games, features, pricing, timing etc. We’re not teasing you intentionally; we want to get this right, so we’ve opted to share things step by step as we bring Ataribox to life, and to listen closely to Atari community feedback as we do so. There are a lot of milestones, challenges and decision points in front of us in the months ahead. We’ll be giving you lots more information and status updates as we progress, and we are thrilled to have you along for the ride!”

NRA Calls for ATF to Review Bump Fire Stocks - Why it won’t matter,"NRA Calls for ATF to Review Bump Fire Stocks – Why it won’t matter
(Before It's News)
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
By Rich Mitchell
In a departure from its usual opposition to restrictions on firearms and firearm accessories, the National Rifle Association is officially asking the ATF to review bump fire stocks similar to those used by Stephen Craig Paddock to kill 58 people and wound almost 500 others in Las Vegas Sunday night. The review won’t likely change anything. ” In Las Vegas, reports indicate that certain devices were used to modify the firearms involved,” the NRA said in a statement referring to bump fire stocks. “The National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law. The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.” The review, performed by the ATF’s technical division, functions to clarify laws and rules around devices and substances the agency regulates. An ATF review of bump fire stocks is likely to yield no substantive changes to the availability of the devices because there is no law nor regulation prohibiting the use of a device that helps a shooter shoot faster. The trouble comes from definitions in the National Firearms Act of …

Italy culls birds after five H5N8 avian flu outbreaks in October,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy has had five outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian flu in farms the central and northern parts of the country since the start of the month and about 880,000 chickens, ducks and turkeys will be culled, officials said on Wednesday.
The biggest outbreak of the H5N8 virus, which led to the death or killing of millions of birds in an outbreak in western Europe last winter, was at a large egg producing farm in the province of Ferrara.
The latest outbreak was confirmed on Oct. 6 and about 853,000 hens are due to be culled by Oct. 17, the IZSV zoological institute said.
Another involved 14,000 turkeys in the province of Brescia, which are due to be culled by Oct. 13.
A third involved 12,400 broiler chickens at a smaller farm in the province of Vicenza and two others were among a small number of hens, ducks, broilers and turkeys on family farms.
In those three cases, all the birds have been culled."

Bob Corker: Trump puts US on course for 'World War Three',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Corker announced his retirement last week
US President Donald Trump could put the US ""on the path to World War Three"", the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has warned.
Senator Bob Corker said Mr Trump was treating the presidency like ""a reality show"".
The retiring Tennessee lawmaker also said White House staff struggle to ""contain"" Mr Trump.
Mr Corker's comments are a remarkable attack on a sitting president from a member of his own party.
Mr Corker was considered for the job of secretary of state by Mr Trump last year but they have since fallen out.
Trump could pay high price
By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter
Donald Trump has gone after members of his own party before. Most, however, have chosen to grit teeth and suffer in silence.
Not Bob Corker. Maybe there's something liberating about knowing you don't have to face an angry pro-Trump electorate next year. Maybe, as head of the foreign relations committee, the Tennessee senator feels compelled to condemn the havoc he believes Mr Trump is causing to US foreign policy.
The president hasn't responded to Mr Corker's stinging rebuke yet, but according to a White House official, the president is ""not finished with Corker"".
The problem for the president is that, although Mr Corker is retiring, he's not leaving the Senate until January 2019.
Until then, he's chair of a powerful committee and a key vote in a chamber where only few party defections will sink any Republican-backed legislation.
The president may be settling scores with the Tennessean, but it could come at a high price.
Four ways Corker skewered Trump
Follow @awzurcher
The senator told the New York Times in a telephone interview on Sunday he was concerned about the president's conduct.
""I don't think he appreciates that when the president of the United States speaks and says the things that he does, the impact that it has around the world, especially in the region that he's addressing,"" he said.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Trump said he refused to endorse Mr Corker for re-election
Mr Corker suggested the president - who has repeatedly baited nuclear-armed North Korea - could put the US on course for ""World War Three"".
""I don't know why the president tweets out things that are not true,"" he added.
""You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.""
""I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him,"" Mr Corker told the newspaper.
The ill-tempered exchange began on Sunday morning, when Mr Trump tweeted that Mr Corker had begged the president to endorse him for re-election.
Mr Trump said he refused. He also accused Mr Corker of being ""largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal"".
Mr Corker, who denied the president's account, responded: ""It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center.
""Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.""
Mr Trump is this week expected to de-certify the Obama administration's 2015 agreement to curb Iran's development of nuclear weapons, a deal he has repeatedly condemned.
Last month Mr Corker - who has said the Iran deal should not be torn up - announced he would not seek re-election at next year's mid-term elections.
Mr Corker and Mr Trump previously clashed in August when the senator criticised the president's response to clashes that month between white supremacists and anti-fascist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Mr Trump's attack followed Mr Corker's expression of support last week for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who is widely seen as having been sidelined by the president.
Mr Corker said America's top diplomat was ""in an incredibly frustrating place"", where he ""ends up not being supported in the way that I hope a secretary of state would be supported"".
On Wednesday Mr Tillerson denied rumours that he was about to resign, amid reports he had referred to the president as a moron."
Kimmel gives an emotional plea to lawmakers,Late-night hosts took time during their shows to address gun control and the mass shooting that happened at a country music festival in Las Vegas.
Pelosi tells man who lost wife in Vegas shooting 'we're never going to rest' until Congress acts,"Washington (CNN) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday promised a man who lost his wife in the Las Vegas mass shooting earlier this week that she will not rest until Congress acts on gun control.
""We're never going to rest until we get this done,"" Pelosi told Bob Patterson at a CNN-hosted town hall with Pelosi in Washington, moderated by CNN's Chris Cuomo.
Patterson, who was sitting beside his 16-year-old daughter live via satellite, had asked the House minority leader what she was going to do to prevent mass shootings in the future.
A push for gun violence legislation
Pelosi also reiterated her call for increased background checks and called on House Speaker Paul Ryan to create a select committee to find common ground between lawmakers on gun violence legislation.
""We're talking about a bill that would say you have to have ... a background check,"" Pelosi later said in regard to another question about gun access. ""It's 72 hours, it's a very short background check. So, I'm not making it harder for you to have a gun. All we're just saying is that you have to have a background check.""
Pelosi is one of the few political leaders in Washington who's been able to make a deal with President Donald Trump, but with several high-profile debates roiling on the Hill, the spotlight is on the California Democrat over how she'll lead members of her own party.
The event comes just days after the United States witnessed its most deadly mass shooting in modern American history. At least 58 people died and hundreds more were injured when a gunman open fire into a crowd at a country concert in Las Vegas Sunday night, though there's little evidence that Congress will act on any legislation in reaction to the deadly shooting.
Following the attack, Pelosi wrote on Twitter that she was ""horrified and heartbroken,"" and she said she wants Ryan to create a select committee on gun violence.
Noting that the shooter in Las Vegas appeared to have used a bump fire stock, which allows semi-automatic weapons to simulate automatic weapon fire in their frequency, Pelosi said that she thought there could be momentum to pass legislation banning them.
""I do think there would be bipartisan support coming together to pass a bill to make it illegal to sell those because you can buy them now,"" Pelosi said.
CNN reported earlier Wednesday that some Hill Republicans had voiced openness to a gun control bill along those lines.
Committed to passing a clean bill on DACA
Pelosi pledged her commitment to passing a clean Dream Act bill by December, and called Trump's move to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a six month window for Congress to pass a bill on the program ""inhumane.""
""First of all, the President should never have done what he did, in terms of giving the six months this or that, revoking, and giving six months for us to pass a bill, he should never have done that, it was inhumane thing to do,"" Pelosi said.
""But that's when we when to see him and said, 'Hey, if we're going to have a values based relationship, this is our threshold, this is our threshold, protecting these Dreamers in our country. Because they have come forward, they have revealed their parents, they have revealed their information,' and the President, I think, not because as I say (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer had good table manners, it's because the American people believe in you.""
Pelosi recently met with Trump and other Democrats about a solution to the announced termination of the DACA program. After the Trump administration said it would allow a six-month window for Congress to on the legislation, Pelosi also reportedly encouraged the President to reassure DACA recipients about their futures, despite the uncertainty surrounding the program.
Pelosi ""asked him to tweet this to make clear Dreamers won't be subject to deportation in (the) six-month window,"" according to one source at the time. While Trump sent that tweet, the future of DACA recipients remains unclear.
""You may recall that when we had this arrangement with the President, he called the next day and I said, early in the morning, and I said, 'Mr. President, you have to, it's very important for you to send a message to our dreamers that you're not going after them, not to worry about this,'"" Pelosi said Wednesday night.
The town hall also comes weeks after Pelosi -- along with Schumer -- brokered a deal with Trump over temporarily raising the debt ceiling. The President supported the proposal bought forth by Democrats, which attached hurricane relief money to a temporary raise in the debt ceiling -- in a move that stunned congressional Republicans
Puerto Rico recovery efforts
Pelosi addressed the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico after hurricanes devastated large swaths of the island.
Calling it ""near and dear"" to her heart, Pelosi said she has been unable to reach her college roommate who lives on the island and had been there many times.
""(My) college roommate ... is from Puerto Rico, we call her every day, practically, and we can't reach her,"" Pelosi said.
She continued by discussing the immediate and future needs of those in Puerto Rico.
""In terms of the immediate need, which is the water and the light, I spent the afternoon at FEMA headquarters today and they gave a report about the progress that they had made, but no matter how much progress you made, there's still a long way to go,"" Pelosi said.
She predicted Congress would pass another bill to provide additional resources within the next week and cited the importance of the military presence in the affected areas.
""What we think should have happened sooner, but nonetheless they're there now and we need more, is for the military to be there,"" Pelosi said."
Trump’s Tough Talk on Nafta Raises Prospects of Pact’s Demise,"The collapse of the 1994 trade deal would reverberate throughout the global economy, inflicting damage far beyond Mexico, Canada and the United States and affecting industries as varied as manufacturing, agriculture and energy. It would also sow at least short-term chaos for businesses like the auto industry that have arranged their North American supply chains around the deal’s terms.
The ripple effects could also impede other aspects of the president’s agenda, for example, by solidifying political opposition among farm state Republicans who support the pact and jeopardizing legislative priorities like tax reform. And it could have far-reaching political effects, including the Mexican general election in July 2018 and Mr. Trump’s own re-election campaign.

Business leaders have become spooked by the increasing odds of the trade deal’s demise, and on Monday, more than 310 state and local chambers of commerce sent a letter to the administration urging the United States to remain in Nafta. Speaking in Mexico on Tuesday, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Thomas J. Donohue, said the negotiations had “reached a critical moment. And the chamber has had no choice but ring the alarm bells.”
“Let me be forceful and direct,” he said. “There are several poison pill proposals still on the table that could doom the entire deal.”
The potential demise of the trade deal prompted supportive messages from labor unions, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Steelworkers, as well as some Democrats.
“Any trade proposal that makes multinational corporations nervous is a good sign that it’s moving in the right direction for workers,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio.
If the deal does fall apart, the United States, Canada and Mexico would revert to average tariffs that are relatively low — just a few percent in most cases. But several agricultural products would face much higher duties. American farmers would see a 25 percent tariff on shipments of beef, 45 percent on turkey and some dairy products, and 75 percent on chicken, potatoes and high fructose corn syrup sent to Mexico.

For months, some of the most powerful business leaders in the country, and the lobbies and political figures that represent them, had hoped that the president’s strong wording was more a negotiating tactic than a real threat and that he would ultimately go along with their agenda of modernization. Nafta is nearly a quarter-century old, and people across the political spectrum say it should be updated for the 21st century while preserving the open trading system that has linked the North American economy.
The pact has allowed industries to reorganize their supply chains around the continent to take advantage of the three countries’ differing resources and strengths, lifting the continent’s economies and more than tripling America’s trade with Canada and Mexico since its inception. Economists contend that many workers have benefited from these changes in the form of higher wages and employment, but many workers have lost their jobs as manufacturing plants relocated to Mexico or Canada, making Nafta a target of labor unions, many Democrats and a few industries.
But most business leaders had hoped that the president, whose Nafta criticism has been unrelenting, would be content to oversee tweaks to modernize the agreement, and then call it a political transformation.

It sometimes looked as if that might be the case. The appointment of Robert Lighthizer as United States trade representative, who pledged in his confirmation hearing to “do no harm” to Nafta, reassured many on Capitol Hill, where Mr. Lighthizer had long served in aide roles. And when the administration released its negotiating goals in July for the deal, they echoed many priorities of previous administrations.
But now, eight weeks into trade talks that were originally supposed to conclude by year’s end, the administration continues to push for concessions that the business community warns would essentially undermine the pact, and which few observers believe Canada and Mexico could agree to politically.
“Everyone knows that much of what is being proposed in key areas are, in effect, non-starters, which begs the question as to what, exactly, the administration is trying to achieve,” Michael Camuñez, a former assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama, wrote in an email. It’s not unreasonable to think that by accommodating the president’s most extreme positions, American negotiators are “simply giving Trump cover to do what he really wants: withdraw from the agreement,” he said.
Phil Levy, a trade adviser for the George W. Bush administration, said the president was most likely looking for a pretext to kill Nafta.
“Find me the last trade agreement that U.S. passed with the chamber in opposition,” Mr. Levy said. “You don’t have a chance. It’s hard enough with the U.S. Chamber in favor.”

The most controversial of the administration’s proposals, floated by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, would incorporate a sunset clause in the deal, causing Nafta to automatically expire unless all three countries voted periodically to continue it. That provision has drawn swift condemnation from the chamber and other industry groups like the National Association of Manufacturers, which say that it would instill so much uncertainty in the future of Nafta that it would basically nullify the trade agreement.
Another contentious push by the United States centers on changing Nafta’s rules governing how much of a product needs to be made in North America in order to enjoy tariff-free trade between the countries. The United States is pushing for higher levels, including a requirement to make 85 percent of the value of automobiles and auto parts in North America, up from 62.5 percent currently, and an additional requirement for 50 percent of the value to come from the United States.
That has pitted some of the world’s biggest auto companies against the Trump administration. Industry representatives say such high and complex barriers could deter companies from manufacturing in the United States altogether.

The administration has also proposed limits on the number of federal government contracts that Mexican and Canadian companies can win, as well as significant changes to how disputes are resolved under Nafta.
Business groups say they are firmly opposed to an American push to curtail a provision called investor-state dispute settlement, which allows companies to sue Canada, Mexico and the United States for unfair treatment under Nafta. Meanwhile, Canada has said that it will not consider dispensing with another provision, Nafta’s Chapter 19, which allows countries to challenge each other’s anti-dumping and countervailing duty decisions before an independent panel.
In his remarks Tuesday, Mr. Donohue called the administration’s proposed changes to these provisions “unnecessary and unacceptable.”
Mr. Donohue’s remarks followed a sharp exchange of words between the Chamber of Commerce, the country’s most powerful business lobby, and the Trump administration on Friday.
John Murphy, senior vice president of international policy for the chamber, said the administration’s proposals had “no identifiable constituency backing them” and had sparked “a remarkable degree of unity in their rejection.” He added that business leaders had perhaps never been at odds with an administration over a trade negotiation on so many fronts.

Hours later, the administration fired back.
“The president has been clear that Nafta has been a disaster for many Americans, and achieving his objectives requires substantial change,” said Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the trade representative. “These changes of course will be opposed by entrenched Washington lobbyists and trade associations. We have always understood that draining the swamp would be controversial in Washington.”
Mr. Trump is known for taking a tough negotiating stance, and analysts said the administration might view its ambitious opening requests as a way to gain more leverage in the Nafta negotiations.
But Mr. Murphy and others in the business community cautioned that such an approach would probably be ill-fated. In both Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump is unpopular, and caving to his demands could have devastating consequences for local politicians. Mexican government officials have repeatedly said they would not negotiate with a gun to the head.
“There’s an old adage in negotiations, never take a hostage you wouldn’t shoot,” Mr. Murphy said."

A Game to Help Students Pay the Right Price for College,"Mr. Ranzetta learned all about the system as a teenager. The fifth of six children, he was so determined to get to college that he was already budgeting for it as a high school student. (I reproduced his handwritten budget, which he still has, in a 2015 column.)
After successful stints in the paper-shredding and executive compensation industries, Mr. Ranzetta turned to student loan consulting when his older siblings started sending their own children to college and threw up their hands in confusion and despair when trying to borrow to pay for it.
His phone number was on his company website, and every time a tearful call came in, he asked what might have kept the problems from happening in the first place. Inevitably, it came down to people wishing they’d known at the beginning how large their loan payment was going to be relative to their monthly income.
Payback, and the financial literacy work Mr. Ranzetta has been doing for years (which he pays for out of his own savings), is his attempt to open students’ eyes.
Once he persuaded McKinney to help him, he began working with Jenny Nicholson, one of the creators of Spent. Her work on that project was informed by her own childhood, part of which she spent in Tennessee without running water or electricity.
When she entered the University of California, San Diego, she was the first person in her family to go to college. Nobody told her that when the student loan check lands, it can lead to false feelings of being flush with cash, given that a chunk of the money may be needed for months of living expenses. “I was richer, frankly, than I’d ever been in my life,” she said.
Photo
She avoided the temptation to spend it all, quickly paid back her loans and entered the social work field before landing in advertising. After the success of Spent, McKinney received lots of proposals from potential clients wanting them to recreate it for some other area of decision-making.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Payback, however, is the first project the firm has accepted like this. A big part of the reason, Ms. Nicholson said, is that the firm recognized that paying for college is not just about debt but also about investment. Every decision — from where you attend to what jobs and activities and classes and majors you choose while you are there — is about trade-offs. How much paid work is enough? How much socializing and spending on fun?
And so the game asks players to consider graduation gifts of cash, laptop purchases, meal plans, dorm supplies, books, hours of paid work, the Greek system, vacations and more. A rapid-fire class registration challenge has dire consequences if you don’t act fast enough.
All the while, you see a running total of your debt. But one of the cleverest things about the game is the constant, cumulative tabulation of focus (which paid work can reduce), connections (is an unpaid internship worth it?) and happiness. That last one comes from Ms. Nicholson’s personal experience, for she eventually realized that focus and happiness were sometimes counterpoints and she might have received a better return on her investment in college if she’d had more fun and more friends.
Veteran financial literacy educators and advocates welcome the additional tool, though some of them were underwhelmed by my notion of a grand, master class on paying for college. After all, not every high school student is college material, and many others are aiming for trade training or military service. Sometimes, all of these teenagers are in the same class, so the course work needs to apply to as many of them as possible.
Still, Brian Page, a high school teacher in Reading, Ohio, said he welcomed an additional teaching tool that is highly experiential. He should know, since he’s the educator I wrote about three years ago who takes his students on a yellow school bus tour of pawnshops and payday-lending stores to do math problems using those businesses’ terms and fine print. “It’s not just what you know,” he said. “It’s what you do with what you know.”
Mr. Page has done some consulting work for Mr. Ranzetta but did not work on Payback and reviewed it at my request. He said he especially liked the various ways that players could lose the game and not even complete college, while still accruing debt. That is the worst of all worlds, he noted, since they need to repay the loans but don’t end up with the sheepskin that will make it much easier to get a decent-paying job and thus afford the monthly payments.
There is one other hurdle that teachers may need to clear to be comfortable with using Payback in the classroom. Talking about paying for college inevitably leads to questions about which families have what, how much they’re willing to pay (if anything) and what teenagers even know about their family’s finances. Ms. Nicholson knew from her own experience as the poor kid in class that this could be a source of tension, so the game doesn’t ask for household income. Instead, it assumes a certain level of family contribution plus scholarships. Then, different shortages (that debt can fill) emerge, depending on the colleges a player chooses.
Still, teachers may quite reasonably fear a delicate dance around personal data when teaching about paying for college generally. “The potential teacher reluctance is with the social aspect, not with the topic,” said Laura Levine, the president and chief executive of the nonprofit group JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
With the right planning, however, educators should be able to sidestep revealing too much in front of students’ peers. Students may well have questions for the teacher after class, and Mr. Ranzetta hopes they bring the questions home, too. “My hope is that this is the beginning of a great discussion,” he said.
There is risk that any such game, with its winners and losers, may result in students not attending college or not borrowing enough to do so successfully. But Ms. Nicholson said she hoped that the elements of fun and connections baked into the game would have an entirely different effect.
“I’ll never get all the details right, and there is always going to be someone who asks if we thought about this or that or living in a cardboard box to save money,” she said. “But I hope everyone who plays will understand the concept that you don’t have to give up everything to succeed.”"

"Black rhinos of Botswana, Namibia: Can hunters save them?","Catch ""The Wonder List"" on CNN Saturdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT starting October 7.
(CNN) — Two men approach one black rhinoceros from opposite sides.
Both know that there are fewer than 5,000 of them left on the planet. Both shudder at the thought of this ancient species going extinct in their lifetimes.
On ""The Wonder List,"" Bill Weir heads to Namibia for a rare glimpse of one of the world's last black rhinos.
They agree that the voracious Asian demand for rhino horn as a status symbol is fueled by ignorance and greed. They agree that the gangs of violent poachers who supply this black market must be stopped at all costs. But that is where their agreement ends, because one man carries a camera while the other carries a gun.
One is convinced that strict hunting bans and high-end photo tourism can save Africa's iconic creatures from extinction.
The other believes that without the big-game hunter, there would be no big game. He argues that a man willing to spend a small fortune to shoot a rhino, lion or elephant is the best incentive poor African nations have to protect their wildlife.
What's the best way?
1 / 11 The black rhinoceros is at the center of a conservation debate in southern Africa. On the black market, pound for pound, rhino horn is worth more than gold or cocaine. Those who purchase it believe it is an effective medicine or a status symbol.
So who's right? Which man holds the moral high ground? And in this age of manmade mass extinction, which one's ideas will save the black rhino?
These are the questions that sent ""The Wonder List"" on safari, from the searing deserts of Namibia to the lush delta of Botswana.
We picked these nations because they are neighbors with very different ideas about species protection.
It turned out to be a good choice, because we encountered some of the most incredible wildlife scenes ever filmed and some of the most passionate debates in conservation.
A few years back, Botswana banned hunting. Private game farms still exist, but on state-owned land like the Okavango Delta, animals enjoy the highest level of protection in Africa.
Experience stunning landscapes, piercing sunsets and dramatic night skies as ""The Wonder List"" visits Namibia and Botswana.
Meanwhile, next door in Namibia, tightly regulated ""sustainable-use conservation"" allows for hunting even the most endangered of species.
In 2014, the government auctioned off a black rhino hunt to a Texas oil heir, Corey Knowlton, for $350,000.
Namibian wildlife managers rationalized this by identifying a specific rhino for the hunt -- one that was old, aggressive and well past breeding prime -- and they vowed that the money would go back into rhino conservation.
But for countless animal lovers, that logic is cold comfort."

Joe Arpaio speaks to Sean Hannity after pardon promises to out corrupt Obama DOJ hacks. President Trump officially pardoned 85 year-old former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Sheriff Joe Arpaio joined Sean Hannity in his first interview since he was pardoned by President Donald Trump. Arpaio told Sean he is planning a press conference to expose the hacks at the Obama Department of Justice.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio says that he still believes that President Obama was not born in the United States.
 
 
 
Sheriff Joe Arpaio: Obama’s Birth Certificate is Forgery Press Conference 12/15/16
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio held a press conference in Phoenix on Thursday afternoon where he announced after a five year investigation his investigators have determined that the birth certificate presented by President Barack Obama was a fraudulently created document which has been represented as an official copy of the original certificate. The Sheriff’s office said they have been working this case since August 2011 after the Tea Party asked him to investigate. “We had to follow the evidence,” Arpaio said during the press briefing. The lead investigator, Mike Zullo, presented a video which claimed to show the Obama birth certificate shows “9 points of forgery.” He says they consulted several experts from all across the world including in Italy. We will post the video here as soon as we get it. In the meantime, you can watch the press conference live. WATCH PRESS CONFERENCE LIVE NOW: The investigators took aim at the media for the way they have characterized their investigation. “You have continued to mischaracterized this.. This was not about where President Obama was born. This was about his birth certificate,” said the Maricopa County public information officer. “I didn’t want to be the guy that figured everything out, I wanted it to be the clearinghouse,” Zullo said during the press briefing. 84-year-old Arpaio lost his reelection bid in November to the Democratic contender. The sheriff is among the last high-profile “birthers” left, who question whether the President was born in the United States. Former birther President-elect Donald Trump held his own presser during his campaign, where he acknowledged that President Obama was indeed born in this country, and that he indeed had a legitimate birth certificate.

Sheriff Joe will deliver on his threat to arrest Obama for a double felony in forging his birth certificate. Arpaio says Obama committed the greatest crime in the history of politics and in history at all.
 
Obama could be handed down a sentence of hundreds of thousands of years in detention and will likely not see freedom ever again.

PRESIDENTIAL FORGERY? Sheriff Joe Breaks Down Obama’s Birth Certificate Legitimacy
 
 
 
 
 
 
Judge formally dismisses Arpaio’s criminal case
 
 
 
A federal judge has upheld the validity of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s pardon despite claims from critics that letting his clemency stand would encourage officials to disobey future court orders.
 
Judge Susan Bolton cited U.S. Supreme Court precedent Wednesday when she formally dismissed the criminal case against the former six-term sheriff of metro Phoenix.
 
Two months ago, Bolton found Arpaio guilty of disobeying a court order to stop his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.
 
The ruling comes five weeks after President Donald Trump pardoned Arpaio’s conviction for disobeying a 2011 court order to stop his traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.
 
Prosecutor John Keller says the pardon ends the case and that Arpaio will never be held accountable for defying the order.

People, I’m saying this to you solemnly here:
 
Do I have standing to call out Obama (who’s also called Barry Parks) as the Antichrist? 
 
Well, we’re related to the Bernadottes. Indeed, my family’s relatives include a present-day relative (Norwegian ‘Erling Sven Lorentzen’) which is still alive, who’s the second cousin to the English Throne Holder and who’s kids (my distant cousins) are in line of succession (somewhere after the 70s’ ranking in line of succession) to the British Throne. The family also includes many various aristocrats a Royal Count, one of the Norwegian Royal Court Ladies, (called the ‘Mistress of the Robes’) two Norwegian Papal Chamberlains (a count and baron) during the last two centuries.
 
And so Yes, if anyone does, yes I do indeed have that royal standing to be “entitled” (by royal title and standing) to call out the Antichrist of this time, which is Obama. 
 
I’ve gotten endless flak from BIN admins trying to defend Obama against me revealing the truth about Obama and myself…and they’re listening to the wingbats which are counseling them. I think they’re scared of the truth I’m revealing about Obama.
 
Indeed, I’m also revealing among other that Obama’s real name is Barry Parks; he’s the son of Jim T. Parks. 
 
People, investigate that by Googling it.
 
Why is no one recognizing me as Messiah and Jesus’ 2d Coming? Just askin’. It seems strange that that news won’t get out. My being a Buddhist is a plus seeing Jesus himself predicted he’d not return a Christian. Indeed, because all Christians will be corrupted and none will be saved in the end days said Jesus. But “no one knows the day and hour of that news being spread”, not even me, says the Bible, so the truth will hit when it’s ready. My being the Messiah or Jesus isn’t the issue as because of being a Buddhist I have no stakes in being the Christian Messiah. But what counts is that Christians are losing their grasp on the Apocalypse because they’re not rising up to be counted as the chosen ones. They’re not rising to reveal the Antichrist Obama/ and that’s a damning factor for them and a factor that will send them to eternal hell from what the Bible says and if the Bible is to be believed. There are Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse at BIN that have appeared out of nowhere! They all agree with me that Obama’s the Antichrist: they are reporters THE LIGHT, David Montaigne, Mark Brander and Jaywill (aka the “Horseman of Death”).
 
Now to give a short timeline of events leading up to today, let’s look at my youth when I was brought up in the USA and France to a family influenced by Theosophy and schooling such as Rudolf Steiner’s schools. Theosophy’s basic influence is Buddhism from Helena Blavatsky’s Russian background where the influence of Tibetan Buddhism is rife due to the Mongolian Buddhists within the Russian Federation of nations. 
 
My family relative the Royal Count Tolstoy was also a Theosophical spiritualist and corresponded with Gandhi, who also was himself influenced by Buddhism and Theosophy.
 
My wife and I studied Tibetan language and culture at Paris University for five years in the mid-80s..
 
But when still a child, when I reached 15 years old, I was attracted to the religious life and sought to find a master to teach me meditation or yoga.
 
This brought me to Tibetan Buddhism which I practised for many years as a religious Buddhist starting from 1970.
 
In the late 90s, I sought to pass on my knowledge on Internet and particularly my research upon Kalachakra the deity-teachings which announce the Apocalypse within Tibetan Buddhism.
 
My work on Internet suddenly screeched to a halt though when Obama started running for president in early 2007 because I saw on Internet a school registration to Obama’s name stating his faith as Muslim: that was a signal of a red flag to me.
 
Indeed, that set up a red alert signal to me and during the whole of 2007 I dedicated myself solely to fighting against Obama’s election.
 
To achieve that, I sought to find the most powerful anti-Obama video that I could find on You Tube so as to go and find people to share my convictions with.
 
Through that same logic I tried to find all kinds of venues, forums, blogs, videos, articles’ comments on Internet etc…so as to criticise and block Obama but I ended up on the video with most views and most comments that deals with the birther issue: Obama Citizenship: I Invented the Internet (Ep. 6: October Surprise)
 
 
 
Obama Citizenship: I Invented The Internet (Ep. 6: October Surprise)
 
 
 
 
I spent the full time I had left before the election battling pro-Obama forces in the comments there during several heady weeks. I literally littered that video with endless series of comments.
 
 
 
We’ve been legitimized now since that time 9 LONG YEARS AGO by Sheriff joe Arpaio’s press confernce where he said Obama’s birth forgery is the greatest criminal fraud in US history. And it’s thanks to all our efforts that the truth has come out now.
 
 
 
At 0:10: Obama’s birth fraud is diabolical!… the biggest mass fraud in US history.
 
 
 
Zullo: Obama BC Crime/Biggest Criminal Fraud in U.S. History!
 
 
 
 
———–
 
 
 
Then Obama won the election and I went into guerilla mode because things were starting to look bleak for us.
 
 
 
Then = a miracle happened.
 
 
 
Out of the blue, I found an article on Internet by a Newsweek senior editor, Lisa Miller, called “Is Obama the Antichrist?”
 
 
 
That article stated that the day after Obama’s election the lottery in his homestate drew the Mark of the Beast of 666: And everybody knows that’s the Antichrist. 
 
 
 
That fact is ironclad and anyone can go to the Illinois State Lottery website and browse the “Winning Number History Search” at November 5,2008 – Pick 3 and they’ll find that the draw was indeed 666 on that day.
 
Armed with that weapon, I set out to Christian websites to announce to them that Obama was revealed as the Antichrist by a miracle sent from heaven.
 
 
 
I hit a big brick wall with Christians."
Something Huge From Deep Space Is Coming To Earth And It Will Be Closer Than The Distance Between New York & Tokyo,"And that is only the official estimation!
 
Many were aware of the potential danger of the asteroid Florence, which barely missed Earth on September 1st, and fell into a false sense of security. However, it is time to start paying attention again.
 
NASA announced that an object they named ""2012 TC4"" is heading towards the Earth and is expected to make its approach on October 12th. New Yorkers will be closer to the object - officially named ""2012 TC4"" - than to Tokyo.
 
Compare a possible impact to a watermelon being shot with a BB gun
 
<img src=""https://img1.picload.org/image/dgooploi/2012tc4.png"">
 
Although it is slightly smaller than Florence, this will not help very much because it is much denser (even denser than granite!) and it is moving faster.
 
2012 TC4 is thousands of times heavier than the Chelyabinsk meteorite that devastated an entire Russian city. Based on public records, it will make the closest approach to earth of any other asteroid of its size.
 
Compare a possible impact to a watermelon being shot with a BB gun. In this case, Earth is the watermelon, and the BB gun is 2012 TC4. It would penetrate the crust and get into the magma - causing magma splashes and massive volcanic eruptions. Now Imagine 2012 TC4 landing on Texas.
 
NASA's planetary defense system will be put to the test on October, 12
 
 
Based on the official numbers from NASA the probability of an impact is 1 in 600. However, more disturbing information has been uncovered.
 
In what could not reasonably be a coincidence, NASA is holding doomsday exercises on October 12th, the exact date that the asteroid is supposed to ""miss"" the Earth. It is quite possible that these are not exercises at all, but rather preparations. Although it is likely that few people have any real protection from this event, those who do have a plan may want to consider it. The government may simply be keeping this information under wraps to avoid panic.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he is determined to engage Germany in a debate that he wants to push forward on European reforms, despite a cool initial response from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
“I believe that, if you have a vision, you shouldn’t go to the doctor but you should open a debate,” Macron said in Frankfurt, where he was due to meet Merkel and attend the opening of an annual book fair.
Macron’s visit is his first to Germany since Merkel narrowly won an election last month, losing votes to a far-right party that drew support from people angered by an influx of more than a million migrants over the past two years.
The 39-year-old French president, in a speech two days after the German vote, set out an ambitious vision for Europe, calling for tighter cooperation on defense and immigration, and for a common euro zone budget.
Merkel, still to begin what promise to be difficult talks on building a new coalition government, has cautioned that reforming the euro zone should not be the top priority and the debate should be more inclusive.
Macron was taking part in a panel discussion at Frankfurt’s Goethe University with Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the Green politician best known for his role in the Paris student protests of 1968, and Gilles Kepel, a political scientist and expert on the Middle East."

The Dodgers Dispatch D-Backs and Return to N.L.C.S.,"Four Los Angeles relievers combined to preserve a three-hitter. Kenley Jansen worked around a single by David Peralta for a three-out save, striking out Paul Goldschmidt to end it. Only four batters reached base all night for the Diamondbacks, including Daniel Descalso with a homer.
“It was about finishing them off,” Darvish said, “because momentum can go their way.”
The Dodgers, who won 104 games for the best record in baseball and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, face the winner of the Nationals-Cubs series in the NLCS. Los Angeles fell there to World Series champion Chicago last year.
The Dodgers confined most of their celebration to the clubhouse, never making a move for the pool beyond the outfield wall. Los Angeles distressed the locals by taking a dip there after clinching the NL West in 2013, but for this party, police officers on horses waited at the warning track to keep the Dodgers away.
That was fine by the Dodgers. This wasn’t the bash they’re after, anyway.
“Being around this team for long enough, this is where we expect to be,” ace Clayton Kershaw said. “We are fortunate enough to be in a big market, have a big payroll, have a lot of good players, a lot of talent. They did a great job of putting this team together. They expect us to be here and we expect us to be here, too.”
Bellinger hit his homer in the fifth, then made a daring catch to end the bottom of the inning. The rookie first baseman fell into the Dodgers dugout as he snagged Jeff Mathis’ pop-up, nearly dropping into the lap of manager Dave Roberts.
“I should have been a little quicker to save him,” Roberts said, “but that was a heck of a play.”

The 22-year-old Bellinger is the youngest Dodger ever to homer in the postseason — he’s 75 days younger than Corey Seager was when he set the mark last fall. Bellinger was just 1 for 12 with five strikeouts in his first postseason before hitting Greinke’s 3-1 pitch over the wall in left for a 2-0 lead.
Bellinger, who may follow Seager as NL Rookie of the Year, also brought home Chris Taylor with a groundout in the first inning. Barnes chased Greinke with a leadoff homer in the sixth.

After Ketel Marte’s first-inning bunt single, Darvish sent down 13 in a row before Descalso hit his second homer of the series. The two-out shot barely cleared the right-field fence over Yasiel Puig’s glove to cut the lead to 2-1.
The Dodgers tinkered with Darvish’s mechanics after the trade, and he was masterful through most of the night, mixing a 98 mph fastball with his deep repertoire of off-speed pitches. He allowed two hits and didn’t walk any over 74 pitches.
“Yu really stepped up,” Roberts said. “He was in command from the first pitch.”
Darvish left after hitting pinch-hitter Christian Walker in the bill of his helmet to begin the sixth.
Greinke — the ex-Dodger signed to a $206.5 million, six-year contract by Arizona before the 2016 season — gave up three runs and four hits in five-plus innings. He struggled with his command, walking a season-high five and throwing 103 pitches through five innings. Greinke faced 3-2 counts against five of his first eight batters and was at 54 pitches through two innings.
“They’re ready to hit, which is tough, but they’re not chasing the pitch you want them to chase,” Greinke said. “That’s kind of what they do best. They did that the whole series.”
Arizona won its last six regular-season games against the Dodgers, but Los Angeles dominated its NL West rival when it mattered most, sweeping an opponent in the postseason for the first time since the 2009 N.L.D.S. against St. Louis.
It was a tough ending to a big turnaround season for the Diamondbacks, who went from 69-93 in 2016 to 93-69 this year.
“I want to remember how I feel,” first-year manager Torey Lovullo said, “because I think it will motivate me, and the pain and frustration that we’re all experiencing right now.”"

Ravens Head Back to the Black Hole,"Ravens Head Back to the Black Hole
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
It’s a matchup of disappointing teams that are both dealing with some key injuries as the Ravens head to Oakland to take on the Raiders. The Ravens last won in “The Black Hole” in Week 17 of the 2009 season, losing in their only other game there in the John Harbaugh era back in 2015.
Let’s take a look at this week’s stats, quotes, and more,c/o Casa Mia’s White Marsh.
KNOW THY ENEMY
SERIES HISTORY
QUOTES OF THE WEEK
S Eric Weddle on the Ravens’ Mindset Going Forward:
“It’s a long season. No one’s pressing the panic button. We’re just not playing well enough to win in all three phases. That’s the bottom line, so we’ll get back to work, look at our mistakes, get a great game plan and get ready to go out there again, because no one’s going to feel sorry for us. This league is ruthless. If you’re down, they’re going to keep you down, and they want to stomp you out. We’ll fight, and guys are getting better. We believe in this team. The belief is there, we just all need to get a little bit better. If everyone gets a little bit better, we’ll start faster and be able to win these games.”
Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin on what sets OLB Terrell Suggs apart from other defenders:
“I think it’s his football intelligence. His physical talents are what they are, and they are well-documented. He is athletic. He is powerful. But his awareness, his feel for the game is displayed statistically in the number of passes that he bats and the fact that he is always not just playing for a sack, but that he is a ball-aware guy; he is a sack-fumble guy. I think his football intelligence is on display in just about every element of his game. He is a very aware player. He makes plays because of that. He has very good hands and eyes.”
LB C.J. Mosley on coming off two tough losses:
“As a leadership and as a team, we’ve got to see what our weaknesses are. We’ve got to correct it quickly. Even though it seems like the season is over, we’re 2-2, and it’s only Week 4, and we’ve got another AFC opponent this week, a great team in Oakland. It’s going to be a tough road game. We’ve got to look at it, correct the mistakes and get ready to play.”
WR Mike Wallace on the offense finding a way to click:
“It’s always frustrating when you can’t score points. With the talent that we have on offense, it’s crazy. We have so many players and so many weapons – we’re just not making plays. We just have to find a way. A quarter of the season is gone, and our offense just hasn’t found ways to make plays. I know that we will. I’m more than confident that we will. We’ve got to find a way to do it. We’ve got to get it going.”
RB Alex Collins on whether the three-man RB rotation allows him to get into a rhythm:
“Definitely. It doesn’t get me out of a rhythm. We’re all fresh, and we all get to ground and pound at the same time. And it gives us an opportunity to be the fresh guy out there. That’s what we do in practice, and we just carry it over into the game.”
GETTING TO KNOW YOU ~ Q&A with Ronnie Stanley
Can you talk about your involvement with Baltimore Animal Rescue and Care Shelter (BARCS)?
“It advocates ‘adopt, don’t shop.’ The organization raises awareness of overpopulation and abusive relationships that a lot of people have with their pets and animals, in general.”
You adopted your dog, right?
“Yes, two of them. One’s a pit bull, and one’s a pit bull/mastiff puppy. I just got the puppy this year, and he’s a lot. Their names are Rico and Lola.”
This summer you connected with former Raven and Hall of Famer Jonathan Ogden. What was that like?
“It was really cool. He’s from my home state, so when I went home, we hung out. He worked out with me a little bit. I went out golfing with him and his son. He’s been a great mentor and has guided me along the way.”
Did Ogden give you advice for 2017?
“He said to keep improving. He was very happy with what I was doing. He was just telling me to keep trying to improve and to keep doing what I’m doing.”
Do you golf often?
“I don’t, but I want to. I was excited when Jonathan Ogden asked me to go golfing because I want to learn [how to play]. I want to learn from someone who knows how to play, and I know he knows how to play. He actually taught me how to hit the ball. So, that was cool.”
What’s the difference between Year 1 and Year 2?
“In Year 2, I definitely feel more comfortable, just understanding my teammates and who everyone is, their personalities. It’s allowed me to be myself.”
What advice would you give to other young players that you might have learned in your rookie year?
“Be a good rookie. When I say that, I mean don’t talk much; just do what you’re told. It’ll come along from there. You’ll get more freedoms as you perform. You do your job first, and the other fun stuff will happen later.”
Describe O-line coach Joe D’Alessandris in one word.
“Upbeat.”
If you could play any other position other than your own, what would it be?
“Defensive end. That’s a fun position. You make sacks, and even if you don’t make a sack, you don’t really get in trouble.”
What has been the toughest stadium to play in?
“From college, it was at Michigan. That was brutal. There were over 100,000 people there. It’s a big stadium, and [Michigan] oversold the game because it was [Notre Dame’s] last game playing there. There’s a huge rivalry between us, and it was a night game. I couldn’t hear anything.”

Italian effort to stop migrants fuels bloody battle in Libya,"It began when a Libyan militia paid by Italy to stop migrants heading to Europe intercepted a group of human traffickers offshore. That confrontation has spiraled into a weeks-long battle among rival militias for control of a Libyan coastal city that has left dozens dead.
The bloodshed in the city of Sabratha is in part an unexpected consequence of Europe's effort to stem the flow of migrants from Libya across the Mediterranean. It illustrates how easily things can escalate out of control in the chaos of the North African country, where three different governments claim authority and the real power in many areas lies with local militias.
The Sabratha fight has expanded, bringing in outside factions, including Khalifa Hifter, the strongman who controls eastern Libya and is a rival of the weak, internationally recognized government based in Tripoli, headed by Fayez Serraj. Hifter appears to be using the conflict to obtain a foothold in the western part of the country.
Thousands of families have fled Sabratha, according to the Red Crescent and local officials. Fighting has endangered the city's dramatic antiquity site — the remains of a 1,800-year-old Roman city. At one point, a militia besieged opposing fighters holed up inside the ruins, with snipers positioned on top of the monuments. Photos on line showed bullet holes in one monument.
""This is a war that started between human traffickers, then snowballed into an ideological and political one,"" said al-Tahar al-Gharabili, head of the Sabratha Military Council, which answers to Serraj's government.
Over the summer, Italy began funneling cash and logistical support to two major militias in Sabratha after they agreed to stop their involvement in human trafficking and instead act as a police force against it, stopping migrant boats. The deal was made through Serraj's government, and the two militias — the Martyr Anas al-Dabashi militia, better known as al-Ammu's militia, and Brigade 48 — were nominally turned into arms of its security forces.
The deal led to a dramatic drop in migration from Sabratha, a city on the western side of Libya's Mediterranean coast that used to be the main launching point for migrant boats.
But voices in Libya decried the deal, fearing that the salaries and supplies would enrich the militias and make them more powerful. The boost to one side threw off the balance of power in Sabratha, triggering a backlash from other local militias.
Al-Gharabili said the conflict began when, last month, a force from the al-Ammu militia clashed with traffickers off shore, thwarting an attempt to move multiple boat-loads of migrants.
The traffickers came from the al-Wadi district, in eastern Sabratha. Because of al-Ammu's crackdown, hundreds of migrants had been stuck in al-Wadi unable to leave, and the traffickers were desperate to move them, al-Gharabili said. ""The situation exploded,"" he said.
The next day, Sept. 17, a paramilitary force allied to al-Wadi opened fire on members of al-Ammu's militia, killing one and wounding others.
Since then, at least 93 people have been killed, including eight civilians, and more than 180 wounded in battles that have carved up the city, according to Essam Karrar, the head of Sabratha Civil Society Federation.
Fighting the past few days has been more intense even than during the 2011 civil war, al-Gharabili said, as militias this week tried to capture al-Ammu's headquarters, a former resort called Shahrazad. Hospitals, hotels and homes have been hit.
The core of the conflict is between al-Ammu and Brigade 48 militias on one side and, on the other, the al-Wadi militia and the Anti-ISIS Operation Room, a force of army officers created to fight the Islamic State group.
All the factions involved are nominally under the authority of Serraj's government — underscoring how little power it actually has over any of them.
Bashir Ibrahim, the al-Ammu spokesman, acknowledged that the deal with Italy was one trigger of the Sabratha fighting. ""Certainly, this is among the reasons,"" he said. ""It's about power.""
Al-Ammu's opponents depict it as a ""terrorist"" group linked to Islamist factions and portray themselves as seeking to re-establish state control and stop trafficking.
An al-Wadi spokesman, Hussein al-Alagi, called the Italian deal a ""disaster"" that reinforces a ""bunch of criminals and terrorists.""
An Operations Room spokesman, Saleh Graisia, told the AP that the time has come to ""remove the tumor that has been growing in Sabratha,"" referring to the al-Ammu militia.
The fight has grown more complicated as Hifter has thrown his support to the forces fighting al-Ammu. In a statement to the Italian media outlet ADNkronos, HIfter said the fighting in Sabratha was a ""legitimate war"" against armed groups ""that embrace terrorism and human trafficking.""
Hifter is backed by the eastern-based parliament that is the rival of Serraj's government, and he has spoken in the past of moving into the west. He has also sought to boost his legitimacy in international eyes, urging Europe to support him as a force to stop migration across the Mediterranean.
A Hifter spokesman, Col. Ali al-Mosmari, vowed on Twitter that the assault would continue ""until the whole city is terrorist-free.""
Al-Gharabili said Hifter is working closely with the Anti-ISIS Operation Room, something the group's spokesman denies. One of his top commanders recently visited the Operation Room, and another senior Hifter associate recruited men from the area to create a force fighting alongside it, al-Gharabili said.
Also, the al-Wadi militia is believed to be made up of ultraconservative Salafi Islamists known as the Madkhalis who are longtime allies of Hifter in the east. Al-Alaqi said the force is made up of ""moderate Muslims"" and denied it has direct contact with Hifter, saying they only share ""common interests""
Al-Gharabili said he believes Hifter is trying to gain influence in western Libya as leverage in talks with Serraj's government, perhaps ultimately hoping to control of Sabratha, a nearby oil facility and the border crossing into Tunisia further west.
He said Serraj's Defense Ministry has ordered the creation of a force from fighters around the west to move into Sabratha and stop the fighting.
""This is no longer a Sabratha war, it's the entire western region,"" he said.
It also leaves uncertain the future of Europe's effort to stop migrants by enlisting local forces.
Ibrahim from al-Ammu lamented that fighting has turned brother against brother in Sabratha. Members of the large al-Dabashi family belong to factions on both sides.
""Sabratha is like a mosaic. You arrange it in a way that give you a beautiful picture or in a way that turns very ugly just like now,"" he said."
Ravens Won’t Back Down,"Ravens Won’t Back Down
(Before It's News)
The Ravens are a mess. I’ve written about this before much to the chagrin of diehard fans. But sometimes the truth hurts and one look at Marty Mornhinweg’s anemic offense is all the reminder you’ll ever need.
Sure, injuries have played a role. How much better would the offense be if the Ravens had Marshal Yanda, Alex Lewis and Nico Siragusa across the offensive front? How much better might the running game be if Kenneth Dixon was available? How much better might the rapport be between new receiver Jeremy Maclin and Joe Flacco if the Ravens quarterback was available during training camp and the preseason?
Think of the defense with Tavon Young, Zach Orr and Brent Urban.
The losses have been brutal, but that’s life in the NFL. It is what it is and teams have no choice but to move forward and try to get better with each practice. It sounds cliché-ish, but really, what else can they do, quit four games into the season. John Harbaugh’s teams have been a lot of things since Super Bowl 47, many of them not so good. But one thing they’ve always been is gritty and resilient.
They won’t back down and possess a very solid, collective work ethic, one that Harbaugh hopes will propel improvement.
“We just have to improve. You’re not going to make a bunch of changes; you just have to improve. There were some flashes in there, and we have to build on those things. It’s a process. You have to go to work, and you work to improve. We have playmakers out there, and we can put the ball in peoples’ hands. We can run the ball – we’ve shown that. We have to eliminate the mistakes and make more plays.” ~ John Harbaugh
The good news for the Ravens is that they are only 1 game behind the Steelers in the AFCN, a team that really hasn’t been all that impressive nor has the rest of the league for that matter. Take a look around. The league is a mess!
The Chiefs sport the NFL’s best record with a perfect (4-0). They stand alone. Besides the Steelers, other division leaders include the Eagles, Lions, Panthers, Rams, Bills and Jaguars. None are without flaws. None are immune from injuries.
This week the Ravens travel to Oakland to take on a (2-2) Raiders team that will be without its quarterback, Derek Carr. Last season the Raiders were (12-3) with Carr, (0-2) without him. It’s a big loss.
What will be the Ravens record at the halfway point of the 2017 season 6-2 5-3 4-4 3-5 2-6 View Result Total votes: 0 6-2 (0 votes, 0%) 5-3 (0 votes, 0%) 4-4 (0 votes, 0%) 3-5 (0 votes, 0%) 2-6 (0 votes, 0%) Vote
Next week the Ravens return home to M&T Bank Stadium where they’ll host the Bears who announced that rookie signal caller Mitch Trubisky will be behind center. Under John Harbaugh the Ravens are (9-0) against first-year quarterbacks. After that it’s the Vikings on the road who will be without RB Dalvin Cook and possibly QB Sam Bradford. Then it’s home for Thursday Night Football against Jay Cutler and the Dolphins.
In a league where the only certain thing is uncertainty, these four games, despite the Ravens struggles, are all very winnable, assuming the Ravens make John Harbaugh’s hopes become a reality.

Stephen Strasburg threw seven scoreless innings and struck out 12 and Michael A. Taylor hit an eighth-inning grand slam to draw Washington even at two-games apiece with a win over Chicago in the National League Division Series.
The fifth and deciding game will be played in Washington on Thursday with the winner advancing to the NL Championship Series to face the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Strasburg shut down the Cubs a day after he continued to experience flu-like symptoms that began last week.
The right-hander was not expected to start for the Nationals but after reporting to Wrigley Field feeling better, he held the Cubs to three hits and two walks.
With the Nationals clinging to a 1-0 lead in the eighth, Taylor blew the game open with the first post-season grand slam in Nationals franchise history off Cubs closer Wade Davis.
Davis entered the game with two outs in the inning after reliever Carl Edwards, Jr walked two hitters to load the bases."
New York Times wants Weinstein to release accusers from NDAs,"Facing the specter of a lawsuit, the New York Times is calling on Harvey Weinstein to release the women who have accused him of inappropriate behavior from their non-disclosure agreements.
""Mr. Weinstein should publicly waive the NDAs in the women's agreements so they can tell their stories,"" a Times spokesperson told CNN in a statement. ""As a supporter of women, he must support their right to speak openly about these issues of gender and power.""
Lisa Bloom, one of the attorneys representing Weinstein, was not available to comment on the Times' request, her office told CNNMoney.
The Times' challenge comes a day after the paper published a blockbuster story detailing nearly three decades of alleged sexual misconduct by Weinstein, and claiming that Weinstein had settled legal settlements with at least eight women. It also follows a legal threat from Weinstein's attorney that was issued shortly after the story was published Thursday.
Weinstein, one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood and a major Democratic donor, released a statement on the allegations in which he apologized for past behavior -- and vowed to fight against conservative groups like the NRA.
But the contrition was followed by a statement on Thursday from Weinstein's attorney, Charles Harder, in which he revealed his client intends to file a defamation lawsuit against the Times.
Harder, the attorney who led Peter Thiel's legal assault on Gawker, said Weinstein would donate the proceeds to women's groups. Harder also claimed that Weinstein's camp provided information that the Times failed to include, but he did not identify specific inaccuracies in the report.
Weinstein, who said he was taking a leave of absence in response to the allegations, told the New York Post Thursday that he intended to sue the Times because the paper gave him inadequate time to respond.
The Times claims Weinstein had ""two days to respond to specific allegations, which dealt with events that he had first-hand knowledge of, before our story published.""
""Mr. Weinstein and his lawyer have confirmed the essential points of the story,"" the spokesperson added. ""They have not pointed to any errors or challenged any facts in our story."""
11 Drill by School Official Threatening to Kill Them,"By Matt Agorist
Honolulu, HI — In America’s modern-day police state, it seems the state knows no bounds as to how far it will go to keep children and adults in a perpetual state of fear. A recent lawsuit out of Hawaii illustrates the extent of the American fear culture and how its insanity is tormenting and traumatizing America’s youth.
For more than 10 minutes, middle school children were held hostage by a raging lunatic in a mask, swinging a hammer while threatening to kill them all. Naturally, officials claim this drill, involving a school official wearing a mask and holding a hammer while threatening to kill children, was done for the “safety of those children.” Well, Michelle and Eddie Chavez aren’t buying that excuse.
According to a report from Courthouse News, the couple has since filed a federal lawsuit over this incident.
An abusive lockdown drill in which a masked man threatened a middle-school classroom with a hammer left the entire class in tears and at least one girl with post-traumatic stress disorder, her parents say in court. Michelle and Eddie Chavis sued Hawaii and the state Department of Education on Sept. 7 in First Circuit state Court. According to the bizarre complaint, their daughter and her class at Kaimuki Middle were watching a video about the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2015. Suddenly, “a man wearing a mask rushed into the classroom swinging a large hammer while threatening the students with serious bodily injury and/or death,” the complaint states. The complaint continues: “Minor and her classmates were immediately placed in fear for their lives. The masked man then walked out of the classroom with the classroom teacher running out behind the masked man, apparently in pursuit of the masked man. Upon the classroom teacher’s return, the teacher locked the classroom doors and called the school office to notify the school administration of the masked man. “Minor and other students in the classroom were crying and feared for their lives, as they believed they were going to be killed. The classroom teacher was pacing around the classroom and appeared scared, as well.” Only then, the parents say, did the school administration announce that it was a lockdown drill, planned ahead of time, “to be as realistic as possible.” The Chavis’s daughter already had been under the case of a psychologist for two years, and the school knew it, they say. She continues to suffer from the stress of the drill, and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Her parents seek damages and special damages for negligence, breach of duty of care, personal injuries, medical expenses and loss of enjoyment of life. They are represented by Harrison Kiehm.
After the drill first became public in 2015, school officials were quick to defend the decision. In response to an inquiry from KHON 2 news, the Department of Education released a statement at the time noting, “Safety drills provide real-life situations where schools can analyze areas of strengths and weaknesses. In order to accomplish this, students are not notified when a drill will take place.”
According to KHON, the principal at Kaimuki Middle School told KHON2 sometimes they do notify students about these lockdown drills and sometimes they don’t, and they don’t plan on changing that because they want to make sure they know how students will react during these very different situations.
According to psychologist Dr. Suzanne Gelb, however, these experiences “can be very devastating. It can result in nightmares. It can be a result in a resurgence of problem behaviors that maybe were taken care of already, like rebelliousness, acting out.” Many of the parents whose children witnessed this drill agree.
Parents, who did not want to be identified, told KHON2 their kids were in tears and terrorized by the scene.
“(My child has had) sleepless nights since it’s happened, very anxious, concerned about going to school,” one parent said.
The student said at least six kids in her class were crying during the drill.
Another parent said her daughter “was afraid, and she was crying, and another friend was crying as well, and they thought they were going to die.”
What, exactly, the school was attempting to ‘teach’ the kids with this drill remains to be seen. No lessons were learned and the end result was simply a long list of traumatized children.

Britain will suffer from Brexit more than EU: German minister,"German Minister of Economy Brigitte Zypries attends the weekly cabinet meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, September 13, 2017. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will experience trade difficulties due to Brexit but Britain will suffer more that the remaining European Union members when it leaves the bloc, Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said on Wednesday.
“I expect we will of course have problems with trade ... but it will not be so hard for Europe as for Britain,” Zypries told a news conference in Berlin to present updated German government growth forecasts."
Why Armenians love strangers,"I never meant to spend the night in Dilijan. I’d been making my way through northern Armenia towards the capital city of Yerevan, having crossed from Georgia several days earlier. My travels were taking me south, but slowly. The landscapes up here were all muscle and brawn: dry escarpments and deep, hefty canyons.
It was clear early on that Armenia was going to be interesting
It was clear early on that Armenia was going to be interesting. After crossing the border from Georgia I’d hopped onto an old marshrutka – one of the cheap, omnipresent public minibuses that beetle through the Caucasus – and as we pulled away the driver placed a live bird, delicate and honey-coloured, onto the dashboard.
The bird watched the road for five minutes, fluttered in circles over the unperturbed passengers then departed through the window and out into the tough, tawny hills. Was this a homing exercise? A good-luck ritual? I never found out. A sign to expect the unexpected, maybe.

• What can Albania teach us about trust?

• The two countries as close as brothers
But I never meant to spend the night in Dilijan. I’d dawdled for too long around the Unesco-listed monasteries of Debed Canyon, and by the time I arrived in late afternoon, the marshrutkas, I gathered via sign language, were resolutely done for the day. No transport was forthcoming.
But the little town was attractive, slung across slopes cloaked in oak woods. A night here would surely be no hardship. I later learned that in Soviet times Dilijan had earned a reputation as an artists’ retreat, and that its picturesque forested location means it gets referred to as ‘Little Switzerland’.
I did, however, need a place to stay. Consulting my outdated guidebook yielded a solitary guesthouse address, which after some investigative work (I found the Armenian alphabet as impenetrable as medieval sheet music), I eventually located high up in the town outskirts. I hoped, as I climbed the street, that I might at least find someone in.
The house was on a quiet residential hill, set back from a dusty road behind metal gates. I knocked, and was met with a long silence. Guests, it seemed, were not a regular occurrence. The chance was considerable, I realised, that it was no longer even a guesthouse. I wondered whether I might have the wrong place. I tried hollering the Armenian words for hello – an optimistic “barev dzez” – into the driveway, first tentatively, then louder, feeling foolish. At last there were footsteps, and the gates were opened by a middle-aged lady in an apron.
She looked at me quizzically. I pointed to my guidebook. To my relief she smiled and took my elbow, ushering me towards the house. I was shown to a basic room with a bed smothered in colourful floral blankets. I became aware that the house was humming with noise. Laughter rang down the corridor. “Nineteen o’clock,” said the lady, in English, pointing to the room opposite. She mimed eating. “Nineteen o’clock.”
I was tired, and confused too – I hadn’t expected dinner – but at 7pm I did as I was asked. What was to follow was a heady, hearty, vodka-fuelled evening I simply hadn’t seen coming. In appearing at the requested hour, I found myself swept into a celebration dinner for the 18th birthday of the family’s eldest daughter. My hand was shaken vigorously, my seat pulled out for me. There were 12 of us sat around the table that night, and a noisy bunch we were: Lusine, the daughter in question; a convivial assortment of her nearest and dearest; and one bemused but delighted traveller.
The food came in huge portions. The lady that had welcomed me in was Lusine’s mother, and she took charge of affairs. Plates appeared piled high with lavash, the unleavened flatbread that forms the staple of the Armenian larder. There were aubergines and olives, fresh radishes and mounds of stringy cheese. Then came barbequed pork, and greens with garlic. At some point there was a bowl of chopped mushrooms fried with onions, and chicken in an unctuous, spicy sauce. The menu became something of a blur.
The reason for this was the oghi, or homemade fruit vodka. Our feast-bearing table was split by gender, with females at one end and males at the other. I gathered, thanks to the English spoken by the birthday girl, that I had an uncle either side of me. Both were jovial and thick-limbed, and took it as their duty to ensure that my shot glass was never dry for a second longer than necessary. Just as the food was brought out liberally, so too was the potent, berry-based firewater.
As the banquet roared on, the uncles insisted that our end of the table drink to everyone and everything. To Armenia. To the UK. To their families. To my family. To people long dead. To the future. To friendship. Some toasts left me clueless, but all went the same way – the chink of glasses, the tossed elbows, the warm throat-burn of alcohol. Soon there were songs, and cakes. I was dizzy with it all. The evening ended with bear hugs all round, and linguistically doomed attempts to declare everlasting kinship.
When I left the next morning, tender-headed but filled with a bumper breakfast and more generous goodwill, my resolve to leave some money for the previous night’s meal received such stern refusal that I backed down for fear of causing insult. After being handed an address for a relative in southern Armenia – a contact I now deeply regret never following up – I was seen off with warmth, and wandered down to the marshrutka yard in a daze.
When you encounter hospitality in Armenia, you’re unlikely to forget it
Only then did the extent of the family’s welcome sink in. I was a complete stranger from a country thousands of miles away. I’d turned up at their gate, unannounced, unshaven and barely an hour before a landmark family dinner, yet I’d not just been granted a bed but been ushered into the festivities as naturally and lavishly as if I’d been one of their own. It stretched the definition of ‘guesthouse’ to improbable extremes.
Armenians, like their Caucasus neighbours, have long been renowned for generosity to outsiders. The country’s location on the historical trade networks of the Silk Road is integral to this. The region has seen the passage of countless thousands of merchants, soldiers, migrants and wayfarers. As long ago as 400BC, the Greek general Xenophon brought his troops this way and gave accounts of tables groaning with lamb, poultry and barley wine.
It should perhaps be pointed out that the three Caucasus nations – Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan – retain a healthy suspicion of each other. There’s a wry Armenian joke that sums it up. A boy asks his grandfather why Armenia hasn't yet sent an astronaut to space. “Because the Georgians would die of envy,"" the grandfather replies. ""And if the Georgians died of envy, then we'd die of pleasure – and the Azeris would be left with all the land."" Towards travellers and outsiders, however, local hospitality throughout the region is astonishingly generous.
Armenia has known unspeakable pain and hardship, not least in the form of the deportations and deaths of up to 1.5 million of its people between 1914 and 1923. Dozens of US states and 29 countries have recognised this as an act of genocide by the Ottoman Empire. Today’s Turkish state denies the description. Armenia’s national psyche has, inevitably, been shaped by the period. And in so doing, the notion that those who come in peace should be welcomed with open arms has only been strengthened.
I can say this much: when you encounter hospitality in Armenia, you’re unlikely to forget it.

Hurricane Nate is now a category one storm with 90 mph winds and its projected track is centered just east of Biloxi, Mississippi for an early Sunday morning landfall. Nate is forecast to make landfall around 1 AM CDT as a high category two storm with maximum sustained winds of 105 MPH. Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage: Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks. The storm is currently positioned at 26.6N, 88.4W with maximum sustained winds of 90 MPH. The storm is moving quickly, 26 MPH, to the north-northwest and has hurricane-force winds that extend outward up to 35 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles. Nate is expected to produce storm surges of 4-6 feet from Morgan City, LA to the mouth of the Mississippi River, 7-11 feet from the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida border and 4-6 feet from the Alabama/Florida line to the Okaloosa/Walton County line. Because Nate is moving so quickly, affected areas are expected to only see between …

Cubs Open Title Defense With a One-Two Punch From Bryant and Rizzo,"The Nationals, on the other hand, claimed the N.L. East crown for the fourth time in six years, and did so in early September thanks to a weak division, a strong rotation and a powerful lineup.
Much like the Cubs, Washington knows what it’s like to wait for a championship. Although the Nationals have been in existence only since 2005, a Washington baseball team has not won a World Series crown since 1924.
Behind a rotation that featured Max Scherzer, Gio Gonzalez and Strasburg, the Nationals liked their chances this fall. But because of a hamstring injury in his final start of the regular season, Scherzer was pushed back to Game 3 of this series. This prevented Scherzer, who has a shot to repeat as the N.L.’s Cy Young Award winner, from starting twice in this series.
The Game 1 assignment was instead given to Strasburg, who enjoyed perhaps the best regular season of his career but had made only one career postseason start before Friday because of a team-ordered shutdown in 2012 and an arm injury last year.

For the first five innings on Friday night, Strasburg and Hendricks were locked in a true pitchers’ duel. Hendricks, whose fastball sits in the high 80s, had allowed two hits, but flummoxed the Nationals’ lineup with a mixture of movement and location. Strasburg was more dominant, carving through the Cubs’ lineup with cartoonish pitch movement and velocity in the high 90s.
But in the top of the sixth, the Cubs’ Javier Baez led off with a ground ball chopped to Anthony Rendon, the Nationals’ slick-fielding third baseman. He dropped it.
The mistake would change the game. Hendricks moved Baez to second base on a sacrifice bunt, and then Ben Zobrist flied out. With two outs, however, the scoring opportunity fell to Bryant.
And he came through, sending a 96-mile per hour fastball that moved back over the plate into right field for a run-scoring single to break up Strasburg’s no-hitter. Bryant astutely took second base on the throw home and Rizzo then smacked a high fastball into right field for another run-scoring single.

While Hendricks kept the Nationals off the scoreboard for seven innings, Rizzo notched another critical hit in the eighth inning, driving in Jon Jay with a two-out double off reliever Ryan Madson. The Cubs were back to their recent October ways.
“Last year, I don’t care what anyone says, the pressure we didn’t really let it affect us,” Rizzo said before the series. “But you look back and it was through the roof. From breaking the curse to the way we did it, the series we went through, the teams we beat. I don’t see it being any easier this time around, but I think we’re built for it and I think we’re ready for it.”
So far, they certainly are."

Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports
(The Sports Xchange) - Highlights of Monday’s Major League Baseball playoff games:
Dodgers 3, Diamondbacks 1
Rookie Cody Bellinger homered and drove in two runs, Yu Darvish pitched five strong innings, and the Los Angeles Dodgers swept their way into the National League Championship Series with a 3-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks in Game 3 of the NL Division Series on Monday.
Bellinger and Austin Barnes homered off Zack Greinke (0-1). Darvish (1-0) gave up one run and struck out seven in five-plus innings to send the Dodgers to the NLCS against the winner of the Chicago Cubs-Washington Nationals series. The Cubs beat the Dodgers in six games in the NLCS last year.
Bellinger, the likely NL Rookie of the Year, had 39 regular-season homers but was 1-for-12 in the NLDS before his opposite-field homer made it 2-0 in the fifth inning.
Barnes’ homer gave Darvish a 3-1 lead in the sixth inning, and the Dodgers used four relievers to hold on. Kenley Jansen recorded his second save of the series.
Astros 5, Red Sox 4
The Houston Astros clinched their first trip to the American League Championship Series with a 5-4 victory against the Boston Red Sox in Game 4 of their AL Division Series on a rainy Monday afternoon at Fenway Park.
Houston won the best-of-five series 3-1 after Boston temporarily staved off elimination with a 10-3 win in Game 3 on Sunday, assuring the Red Sox would not be swept in the ALDS in consecutive seasons.
The Astros will face either the Cleveland Indians or the New York Yankees in the ALCS. Cleveland leads its ALDS series against New York 2-1 with Game 4 scheduled for Tuesday night.
Josh Reddick drove in the go-ahead run on a two-out single to left field in the eighth inning off Boston’s Craig Kimbrel, who relieved starter-turned-reliever Chris Sale (0-2) in the eighth after Houston tied it.
Evan Gattis reached second on a hard-hit bouncer down the third base line with one out in the inning off Sale, but was sent back to first because it was errantly picked up by a ball girl.

After Cameron Maybin entered as a pinch runner for Gattis, George Springer drew a walk off Kimbrel before Reddick’s big hit.
Pinch hitter Carlos Beltran doubled in a critical two-out insurance run in the ninth.
Rafael Devers cut the Astros’ deficit to one with an inside-the-park home run, his second of the playoffs, to lead off the Boston ninth against closer Ken Giles.
Giles proceeded to strike out Jackie Bradley Jr. and got Dustin Pedroia to ground out to complete the six-out save.

Cubs 2, Nationals 1
Anthony Rizzo delivered a go-ahead, two-out RBI single in the eighth inning as the Chicago Cubs beat the Washington Nationals 2-1 in Game 3 of the National League Division Series on Monday.
The victory gave the defending World Series champions a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series heading into Game 4 Tuesday at Wrigley Field.
Rizzo dropped a bloop single into shallow center field off Oliver Perez to score pinch-runner Leonys Martin, who replaced Tommy La Stella after he led off the eighth inning with a walk.
Cubs closer Wade Davis preserved the victory with a scoreless ninth inning. Carl Edwards Jr. (1-0) pitched a scoreless eighth for the win. Brandon Kintzler (0-1) took the loss.
Yankees 7, Indians 3
Aaron Judge capped a four-run second inning with a two-run double, and New York capitalized on shoddy defense by Cleveland to even the AL Division Series at two games apiece.
The decisive Game 5 is Wednesday in Cleveland, where the Indians will be looking to snap a five-game losing streak in elimination games. The Yankees will look to rally from a 2-0 deficit to win an ALDS for the second time.
Yankees starter Luis Severino (1-0) allowed three runs on four hits and a walk in seven innings, pitching most of the night with a sizable lead. After getting one out on Oct. 3 in the AL wild-card game against the Minnesota Twins, he bounced back Monday to strike out nine and throw 113 pitches."

On September 22, 2017, veteran hip-hop rapper Souleye will release his long awaited full-length record, Wildman.
Los Angeles, CA, September 20, 2017 – On September 22, 2017, veteran hip-hop rapper Souleye will release his long awaited full-length record, Wildman. The Los Angeles based artist teamed up with house duo Crush Effect, comprising of Jess Molloy and Dave Veith, to produce an exceptionally eye-opening hip-hop and electronic fused album.
Wildman represents a mindful and musically engaging listening experience. A socially conscious artist, Souleye delivers an innovative and intense lyric flow that drips with passion. His clever references outline a positive sense of being. In “Follow Your Heart,” the debut single from Wildman, Souleye discusses overcoming hesitations with self-awareness and self-motivation in order to follow your own passions. His rhythmic lines weave in and out of the down-tempo grooves and musical stylings of Crush Effect. Molloy and Veith blend elements of electronic, R & B, hip hop, and trip-hop to create a psychedelic and atmospheric album that occupies the space between a traditional compilation record and a concept album.
“One of the reasons so many pop and hip hop albums don’t sound cohesive is that those 12 tracks were recorded in 12 different studios with 12 different producers,” says Veith, of Crush Effect. “It was nice to do a full record, to build that sound from song to song.”
In addition to Crush Effect, the album features guest appearances by an array of upcoming and renowned artists, incorporating fresh, melodic hooks into each song. The album includes focus tracks such as, “Snow Angel” (Ft. Alanis Morissette), “Hip Hop Medicine” (Ft. Dustin Tavella), “Classic” (Ft. Chantal Kreviazuk, Chachillie), “Fountain of Youth” (Ft. Wade Morissette) and the latest single and title-track, “Wildman” (Ft. Lynx).
Souleye is a one-of-a-kind artist making a statement in the hip hop and electronic scene. He continues to shape his signature style with inspiring and poetic rhymes. His carefully selected collaborators offer creative instrumentation that only enhances Souleye’s enlightened lyrics.
About Souleye
Souleye’s musical journey began when he was a teenager in rural Massachusetts, freestyling around a camp fire to entertain his friends. Blending traditional elements of hip hop, EDM and numerous other styles; Souleye’s music crosses the boundaries of genre, defies convention and inspires listeners with uplifting lyrics coupled with both traditional and unusual hip hop beats and samples. His first album, Soul Sessions was released in 2002. Since then, Souleye has released eight studio albums and numerous singles. Souleye has toured extensively with Bassnectar, shared the stage with the Glitch Mob, Tipper, Michael Franti and his wife, Alanis Morissette, with whom he has two children.

"Hard to tell how good Georgia Tech is after 3-1 start, but they are dangerous.","Hard to tell how good Georgia Tech is after 3-1 start, but they are dangerous.
(Before It's News)
Following Georgia Tech’s 33-7 win over UNC, it’s still hard to tell just how good the Yellow Jackets are. To be fair to the Tar Heels, they are an injury depleted team that’s just plan bad. Georgia Tech controlled the game from start to finish. Last week Georgia Tech beat Pitt 35-17 and in week 2 they defeated Jacksonville State 37-10. Neither of those teams scare anyone.
Georgia Tech’s opening week loss to Tennessee even seems suspect as the Vols simply don’t look very good themselves. Still the Yellow Jackets are just 1 bad defensive quarter on that Labor Night from being 4-0 and ranked around 17th. Their UCF game was cancelled.
Here is the question… Is Georgia Tech good enough to be a threat in the Coastal? You just don’t know. They haven’t beat a team that I would describe as good yet, but minus the 1 bad quarter against Tennessee they’ve been in control of every game they’ve played. This is what I am sure of.
Taquon Marshall is an excellent quarterback. He reminds me of Tevin Washington. Washington always seemed to make the right read, and really knew how to run the offense. Marshall appears to be a more athletic version of Washington. The offense has sputtered from time to time, but for the most part has been pretty good. The defense is certainly improved.
Even against offensively challenged teams like Pitt and UNC, the defense has only given up 24 points. They are far better against 3rd down, and the tackling is better. This isn’t an elite unit, but it doesn’t appear to be the liability we’ve seen in years past.
The soft part of the schedule in now behind Georgia Tech, and the schedule really takes an uptick. In 2 weeks the Yellow Jackets play at Miami, and after that it is Wake Forest, at Clemson, at Virginia, Virginia Tech, Duke and Georgia. That’s 4 top 20 teams, and improved Wake Forest, Virginia and Duke teams.
The pecking order in the Coastal looks pretty clear. Pitt and UNC seem like the bottom of the Coastal. Miami and Virginia Tech are the top. Virginia is better, but not really equipped to win the Coastal. Duke is pretty good, but a notch below Miami and VT as we saw in their 31-6 home loss to Miami. Georgia Tech is the wild card in the Coastal, and I think a dangerous one at that.

2018 Projection: Can The Reds’ Luis Castillo Emerge As A Top 40 Starting Pitcher?,"2018 Projection: Can The Reds’ Luis Castillo Emerge As A Top 40 Starting Pitcher?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Luis Castillo was often an overlooked prospect, though it was still a surprise that the Marlins included him in the trade that netted them Dan Straily prior to the 2017 season. Despite never stepping on a Triple-A mound, the Reds ultimately promoted Castillo to the Majors where he emerged as one of the bright spots and entrenched himself in the team’s rotation moving forward:
89.1 IP
3 Wins
3.12 ERA
1.07 WHIP
98 Strikeouts (9.87 K/9)
32 Walks (3.22 BB/9)
58.8% Groundball Rate
.247 BABIP
The doubters are going to point towards luck as a reason for his success, both with his BABIP and strand rate (80.1%). That is a fair point and something we will have to watch closely, though it also was not the sole reason for his success. He showed all three skills we look for, and there’s reason to believe going forward.
The “worst” of his skills was the walk rate, though he consistently showed more coming up through the minors. Included in that mark was a 1.46 BB/9 over 80.1 IP at Double-A prior to his recall in ’17. Considering his 1.38 BB/9 in 117.2 IP at High-A in ’16, as well as a 2.98 BB/9 after the All-Star Break (66.1 IP), it’s obvious that this should be a strength.
You can also question the groundball rate, considering his 1.88 GO/AO in the Majors compared to a 1.15 mark over his minor league career. Obviously the minor league mark isn’t a bad number, though it’s not elite, but it is more than enough given the other skills.
His biggest asset is obviously his strikeout rate, as he showed swing and miss stuff with a trio of pitches (Whiff%):
Changeup – 23.62%
Slider – 15.96%
Fourseam Fastball – 10.22%
With a fourseam fastball that averaged 97.88 mph and a changeup that came in 10 mph slower (87.77 mph), it makes a lot of sense. There’s no reason to think that he can’t continue striking out at least a batter per inning, and that is going to mean success.
Is he quite as good as he looked in 2017? Probably not, but there’s little reason to think that he can’t be a viable option with our projection looking as follows:
180.0 IP, 12 W, 3.70 ERA, 1.22 WHIP, 185 K (9.25 K/9), 58 BB (2.90 BB/9)
A regression in his luck metrics, as well as giving up a few more home runs, is going to lead to an overall drop in his numbers. That said, as a backend option there is an awful lot to like. While he isn’t going to be a fantasy ace, and shouldn’t be valued as such, he’s going to contribute and is well worth targeting come draft day (or as a potential keeper depending on your league rules/format).

"Puig Powers Dodgers to 8-5 Win Over D-Backs, 2-0 Series Lead","The Dodgers have the majors' biggest payroll, but their offense is coming from players of all salaries and pedigrees. And even when the heart of the Dodgers' order produced little in Game 2, their 6-7-8 hitters — Forsythe, Barnes and Puig — were spectacular.
""We've got a lot of good players, and a lot of depth,"" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. ""There are so many guys in our lineup that can hurt you. I don't know how many times they were on base, but (the batters in the) 6, 7, 8 spot, those guys were on base all night, being productive, driving runs in.""
The trio reached base a combined nine times, and Los Angeles turned an early 2-0 deficit into a 7-2 advantage with three rallies, capped by a four-run surge in the fifth.
Barnes, usually the Dodgers' backup catcher, reached base three times and got the night's biggest hit with that fifth-inning double. As for Puig, he has five hits, four RBIs and an uncountable number of tongue-wags, bat-licks and obscure celebratory gestures in just two games.
""It tells you that this team is prepared,"" said Forsythe, who scored three runs in the second playoff game of his career. ""The big thing for us is the guys that aren't in (the lineup every day) are wanting to prove something, and I think that gives them a little added edge. They come out with a chip on their shoulder, and they want to get the job done. They're not scared to do it. They want to do it.""
Paul Goldschmidt hit a two-run homer in the first inning and Brandon Drury added a pinch-hit, three-run shot in the seventh, but the Diamondbacks are on the brink of elimination after Robbie Ray and reliever Jimmie Sherfy couldn't contain the Dodgers' lineup.
Arizona actually has six homers in the series to just one by the Dodgers, who scored eight runs in Game 2 with only one extra-base hit.

""These games are dogfights, so it's going to take a team effort and a collective unit,"" Barnes said. ""We've been doing this all year.""
Game 3 of the best-of-five matchup is Monday at Chase Field. Arizona ace Zack Greinke will attempt to save the season when he faces his former teammates with the Dodgers, who counter with late-season acquisition Yu Darvish.

Greinke is probably the Diamondbacks' best chance to stop the Dodgers from scoring their way out of every problem.
""If you've got to pick one guy to stop this situation we're in, I think we've found the right guy in Zack Greinke,"" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.
Ray had been outstanding in five regular-season starts against the Dodgers, but he had just two days of rest after pitching in relief during Arizona's wild-card win over Colorado, and the left-hander struggled mightily with his control from the first inning.
Ray walked four of nine batters early on, but the Dodgers didn't get their first hit until Forsythe, Barnes and Puig delivered consecutive singles in the fourth in a go-ahead rally.
""I think with the wild-card game, it kind of threw things out of whack a little bit, but that's the format,"" said reliever Archie Bradley, who struck out Jansen in a rare at-bat for the Dodgers closer. ""You have to win that game to get here. So it's about trying to use this off day the best we can to get healthy. The series is not over.""
Drury kept it close with his no-doubt shot in the seventh on Brandon Morrow's first pitch, but the Dodgers rallied for another run in the bottom half.
Roberts went to Jansen after Daniel Descalso's one-out double off Josh Fields in the eighth, and the vaunted closer reprised his multiple-inning dominance from last October, mowing down five straight batters, getting David Peralta on a groundout to end it.

NO JT NO PROBLEM
Justin Turner drove in five runs in the Dodgers' 9-5 victory in Game 1, which began with a four-run first inning against Arizona's Taijuan Walker. Turner went 1 for 4 in Game 2 and popped out with the bases loaded to end the seventh, but the Dodgers didn't even need their slugging third baseman.
SHORT START
Rich Hill made it through just four innings for the Dodgers, yielding three hits and three walks. The veteran struggled with his control and never found a groove, but stranded runners in scoring position in the second and third innings to keep it close.
AMPLE WORK
Kenta Maeda got the victory by getting three outs of middle relief. The Japanese right-hander didn't make the Division Series rotation, but Roberts plans to use the 13-game winner as a specialist against right-handed batters.
BIG CROWD
With 54,726 fans in attendance, the Dodgers had their largest crowd in Chavez Ravine since 2012, before renovations to the venerable stadium. The crowd also was one of the season's loudest, egged on by Puig's enthusiasm and by Hill, who held up a cardboard sign in the seventh inning exhorting fans to get loud.
UP NEXT
Greinke couldn't make it through four innings in the Diamondbacks' wild-card game, but nobody around the Dodgers doubts the $206.5 million right-hander who won 51 games in three years with Los Angeles. Darvish went 4-3 with a 3.44 ERA in two months with the Dodgers, but the Japanese star yielded just one earned run in 19 1/3 innings over his final three starts before the postseason.

Which Team Will Grab AFC North Control?,"Which Team Will Grab AFC North Control?
(Before It's News)
Can the Baltimore Ravens bounce back and beat Pittsburgh for the fifth straight time in Baltimore? RSR Staff give our predictions here:
Todd Karpovich
— Both teams are looking to rebound from brutal losses in Week 3. Baltimore will get a boost by playing at home, where the Steelers have not won since since Dec. 2, 2012.
— The Steelers gave up 220 yards on the ground to Chicago last game. Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said this week that running back Alex Collins could get more opportunities. Collins will seize the opportunity and finish with 80 yards and a touchdown.
— Joe Flacco will go back to managing the game and have modest numbers. His streak of nine straight games with an interception will come to an end.
— The Ravens will keep the pressure on Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who will be sacked twice and have an interception. In 19 career games against Baltimore, Roethlisberger has 31 touchdowns passes and 21 interceptions, going 10-9 over that stretch.
— Twelve of the past 18 matchups between Baltimore and Pittsburgh were decided by three points or fewer. This one won’t be any different.
Ravens 24, Steelers, 21
Derek Arnold
I know Ravens fans are feeling down in the dumps after that beating we took in Jacksonville, but how do you think Steelers fans are feeling? They lost to Chicago last week, and the Bears looked like a Division III squad in Green Bay last night.
That’s today’s NFL, man. A whole lotta mediocrity. I’m not convinced that the Ravens are anywhere near as bad as they played last week. Toss that one out, and hopefully they won’t provide any more evidence that they’re 44-7-loss-to-Jacksonville bad.
Steelers fans are nearly as dismayed by the play of Roethlisberger so far this season as we are at Joe’s mishaps. On top of that, Fat Ben is pretty much always bad on the road, and pretty much always bad in Baltimore. Le’Veon Bell hasn’t gotten untracked yet after holding out through training camp.
I think this will be an ugly one, but give me the Ravens and the under.
Ravens 16
Steelers 13
Ryan Jones
Both the Ravens and the Steelers have had uneven starts to the year. Pittsburgh barely beat a Browns team in Cleveland that the Ravens handled fairly easily, then they beat up on a pretty good Vikings team at home before losing to a pretty bad Bears team in the Windy City. Notice a trend? The Steelers aren’t the same team away from Heinz field. Meanwhile, us Ravens fans were feeling pretty good before last weeks debacle.
I expect the Ravens to rebound. The sense of urgency they had entering the season took a brief hiatus last week but this is a make or break year for some players and coaches in the Ravens organization. Even though they got a little cocky and forgot that last week I think we’ll see the offense play better and the defense more closely resemble the one we saw weeks one and two.
Alex Collins leads the team in carries and yards and sets himself up to be the starter going forward. He grinds out 75 tough yards on about 15 carries and scores his first touchdown.
The receivers get more involved and Mike Wallace finally gets the rock. He finishes with 80+ yards including a touchdown of over 30 yards.
Ravens 23
Steelers 20
Carey Stevenson
The Ravens defense still stewing off its London let down return to its dominant self. They’ll get just enough from their run game to keep them on schedule, a run game where Alex Collins takes over as the early down grinder. Out of necessity, Buck Allen catches a TON of check downs and Mike Wallace slips behind the Steeler defense for a big play. The Ravens pull out a typical hard fought game in the teens behind Justin Tucker’s leg.
Ravens 19 Steelers 16
Adam Bonaccorsi
Both the Ravens & Steelers can’t play any worse than last week; the question is who has the better ability to bounce back.
For the Ravens:
-Joe Flacco will bounce back with 2 scores (and the usual pair of picks), hitting Buck Allen twice in the end zone.
-The Ravens will total only 250 yards of offense, with the running backs accounting for 180 of those yards.
-The Ravens defense will steal a pair of Big Ben picks to shorten the field for Baltimore’s anemic offense.
For the Yinzers:
-Big Ben will find Antonio Brown for 2 touchdowns, and a third from Jesse James.
-Le’Veon Bell will be held in check, with under 75 total yards.
-The Steelers defense won’t do anything special, but the Ravens’ decimated offense will be held in check all day thanks to mediocrity.
Unfortunately, the Steelers have the lead in the 1-score game come 4th quarter, and manage to milk to clock to end it, as they steal one from the Ravens who fall to 2-2 and the fans go bonkers asking about top-5 draft picks, whether the Ravens will take a quarterback early, and how soon we can fire everybody.

"How to Disappear an Activist (Or, Where IS Andy Ostrowski?)","By Janet Phelan
As reported here, activist attorney Andy Ostrowski was taken into custody by the Wilkes-Barre, PA police department on September 19, for a forced mental health evaluation. Ostrowski was reached later that afternoon at General Hospital in Wilkes-Barre, where he asserted he was being held as a political prisoner.
Ostrowski, a radio talk show host and civil rights advocate, also made a run for Congress in 2014.
Per hospital protocol, Ostrowski was subsequently transferred to another facility. And now, no one can say where he is.
HIPAA—Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act—disallows hospitals from confirming if a person is at their facility, if he is on a psych unit. In the conversation on Tuesday, Ostrowski asserted he was most likely to be transferred to First Hospital, in Kingston.
First Hospital, however, will not confirm or deny his presence. As Ostrowski had expressed not only appreciation to this reporter for reaching him at General Hospital, but also asserted the necessity to follow up on his forced incarceration, the failure to reveal his whereabouts becomes a central issue vis-à-vis his right to freedom of association.
However, the hospitals in question do not seem to honor this historical right. The behaviors by staff at both General and First Hospitals couldn’t be more alarming. Yesterday, in an effort to ascertain where he was transferred, I called General Hospital and spoke with a woman who initially identified herself at “Joanne.” Joanne refused to give information as to where Ostrowski was transferred and when asked her full name, she replied “Julia.” According to Joanne/Julia, to disclose where Ostrowski is would violate HIPAA.
When it was suggested that Ostrowski’s right to association trumped HIPAA, Joanne/Julia turned nasty, demanding my data, which I supplied her. She then trounced further on any perception that Ostrowski still has rights, telling me I was “so wrong” about his right to association overriding the hospital’s right to privacy—which is really what HIPAA is protecting here.
Well, it didn’t get much better at First Hospital. This reporter spoke with the media relations director, who not only declined any information as to Ostrowski’s presence, but shot back, “You’ll never know if he is here or not!”
And that may be true and how scary is it….
In an effort to get assistance in determining his whereabouts, contact was made with the Luzerne County District Attorney’s office. The call was transferred to a “Marilyn,” who, after hearing that a request was being made to locate Andy Ostrowski, promised to look into this. When no call back was received, the DA’s office was repeatedly called, at which point they repeatedly hung up the phone on me. An initial request for an email contact was also refused. “We don’t give out our email addresses,” the receptionist stated.
These are public servants, folks….
Recently, yet another radio show host was psychiatrically detained. Speaking on conditions of anonymity, she told me that she was picked up this July in front of a library in a Colorado county, where she had just emerged after speaking with the librarian and others about connections between the local government and a for-profit foster care facility, which may be self enriching through unnecessarily removing children from homes. This radio host was assaulted by a person on leaving the library and when she called 911, the deputy came, slammed her into the wall, cuffed her and brought her to a psych hospital.
She was let go four and a half hours later, and subsequently received a bill for $7300 for her unwanted detention.
Andy Ostrowski, however, may not be so fortunate. He is now “desaparecido”—missing in the gulag.
Several years back, this reporter covered the plight of a man who was under a mental health conservatorship in California. The guardian kept moving Charlie Castle from place to place, as those who were trying to help him assert his rights in fixed proceedings kept discovering his new location. When Castle died under suspicious circumstances, a request for a coroner’s inquiry was made. All that we ever discovered was that the toxicology report—which would have contained the information concerning the suspected cause of his death—had been somehow removed from the file.
The mental health laws tilt against the rights of those under “evaluation” or “care.” They protect the privacy of the institutions which may, in fact, be abusing the individual and the matter of Andy Ostrowski well exemplifies this. When we spoke on Tuesday, he was overpouring with gratitude that I had reached him. He wanted to make sure his story was told. Until those who have a vise grip on his life and his rights decide to honor the latter, he is just one more who is missing in the system and nowhere to be found.

Islanders’ ‘Singular Focus’ Is New Arena at Belmont Park,"The Islanders are combining forces with the owners of the Mets and the Oak View Group, an investment advisory firm led by Tim Leiweke, the former president and chief executive of the sports and entertainment conglomerate AEG. Among the founders of Oak View Group is Irving Azoff, the entertainment executive who has a partnership with Madison Square Garden Company.
Ledecky said the costs of an arena and what percentage the Islanders might own had not been determined.
“It’s much better to say we are linked up with these two terrific organizations that understand how to build an arena,” he said. “The fact that the Mets have endorsed us financially and say that Belmont Park is the best option, that sends a very strong message as well that we’re making the right decision here.”
The Islanders have until Jan. 1 to forge a new deal with Barclays, and, if no new deal is reached, either side can opt out of the current deal by Jan. 30.

The Islanders could choose to leave after this season at the earliest; if Barclays Center triggered the opt-out, however, the Islanders would not have to leave until after the 2018-19 season.
“This year and next year, contractually, we are mutually obligated to play at Barclays,” Ledecky said. “Next year we will play at Barclays by contract.”
As far as where the Islanders might play in the 2019-20 season if a new arena is not ready, Ledecky said discussions were continuing.

“The contract, which has been in the public domain, says there are good faith negotiations going on that would include factors like that,” he added. “But we’re focused on getting that shovel in the ground and moving forward on Belmont.”

The Islanders returned to the renovated Nassau Coliseum for a sold-out preseason game on Sept. 17, but N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman has been adamant that the Coliseum, which has a capacity of less than 14,000 for hockey, is not a practical home for the team.
Ledecky said Barclays Center was a good home for now and agreed with Bettman regarding the cozy Coliseum.
“Barclays is a wonderful place, but unfortunately at the time it was built, they decided not to configure it for hockey,” he said. “And Nassau Coliseum is a lovely spot, but the commissioner of the N.H.L. is on public record saying it is not viable for an N.H.L. team. So that wouldn’t be a home either. We have to have a focus on a place that will be our home. That’s Belmont Park.”
The Islanders will most likely also take into consideration how their pursuit of a new arena deal might affect their ability to re-sign their captain, John Tavares, whose six-year, $33 million contract expires after this season.
Islanders General Manager Garth Snow said he would not speculate on how the negotiations might evolve during the season. Tavares, 27, could become a free agent July 1. Snow said discussions would remain private between himself, Tavares and the player’s agent, Pat Brisson.
Ledecky said he did not know the timetable for the state’s decision on the site. New York City F.C. of Major League Soccer is among the other groups to submit a proposal.
“We obviously would hope it would be sooner rather than later, and we would hope that our proposal is the best proposal,” Ledecky said. “We don’t know if they’ve received three or 10 or five. We certainly put a lot of time and effort into a first-class presentation. We were thoughtful. We want Belmont to be our permanent home. “"

Ceremony to Take Place During Halftime of Legends Homecoming Game with over 75 Jets Legends Expected to Attend
Three Jets to Receive Hall of Fame Ring of Excellence Pregame
September 26, 2017 – The New York Jets will induct former center and perennial Pro Bowler Kevin Mawae into the team’s Ring of Honor during the Legends Homecoming game presented by Toyota against the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 1st at MetLife Stadium. The induction ceremony, scheduled for halftime, is presented by BankUnited.
Mawae spent eight of his 16 NFL seasons with the Jets, starting all 118 regular season games he played with the Green & White. Additionally, Mawae’s seven NFL playoff appearances all occurred with the Jets, as he started two postseason contests in 1998, 2002 and 2004, and one in 2001.
During his career, Mawae was selected to eight Pro Bowls (1999-2004 with the Jets, 2008-09 with the Titans). Mawae also garnered first-team All-Pro recognition seven times (1999-2002 and 2004 with the Jets, 2007-08 with the Titans) and second-team All-Pro once (1998 with the Jets).
As part of Jets Legends Homecoming weekend, more than 75 alumni are expected to be in attendance, including Ring of Honor members Emerson Boozer, Wayne Chrebet, Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons, Curtis Martin, Don Maynard and Joe Namath. All Legends will be introduced on-field 30 minutes before kickoff.
Following introductions, Namath, Maynard and Martin will take part in a special ceremony. Having already received their Gold Jackets and bronze busts upon their enshrinement, they will receive their Ring of Excellence, created by Kay® Jewelers, in front of Jets fans. The Ring of Excellence is the third symbol of recognition by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
To celebrate Legends Homecoming weekend and the Ring of Honor Ceremony, fans are asked to wear white as part of the Jets Annual Whiteout. The team will take the field in white uniforms and Jets Legends will wear white jerseys. Upon entering MetLife Stadium, all fans will receive a commemorative Mawae white rally towel presented by BankUnited.
In 2010, the team created the Ring of Honor to celebrate Jets greats and commemorate their place in team history. Mawae will become the 18th member of the New York Jets Ring of Honor joining Weeb Ewbank, Winston Hill, Joe Klecko, Curtis Martin, Don Maynard, Joe Namath (2010 Inaugural Class); Larry Grantham, Freeman McNeil, Gerry Philbin, Al Toon (2011); Mark Gastineau, Wesley Walker (2012); Marty Lyons (2013); Wayne Chrebet, Leon Hess (2014); Emerson Boozer, Matt Snell (2015).
BankUnited is a longtime partner of the New York Jets and the “Official Private Banking Sponsor of the New York Jets.”

256 Years Old Man Breaks The Silence Before His Death And Reveals SHOCKING Secrets To The World,"What is the longest a person has ever lived for? Meet Li Ching Yuen, a man who lived an astonishing 256 years! And no, this is not a myth or a fictional tale.
 
According to a 1930 New York Times article, Wu Chung-chieh, a professor of the Chengdu University, discovered Imperial Chinese government records from 1827 congratulating Li Ching-Yuen on his 150th birthday, and further documents later congratulating him on his 200th birthday in 1877. In 1928, a New York Times correspondent wrote that many of the old men in Li’s neighborhood asserted that their grandfathers knew him when they were boys, and that he at that time was a grown man.
 
Li Ching Yuen reportedly began his herbalist career at the age of 10, where he gathered herbs in mountain ranges and learned of their potency for longevity. For almost 40 years, he survived on a diet of herbs such as lingzhi, goji berry, wild ginseng, he shoo wu and gotu kola and rice wine. In 1749, at the age of 71, he joined the Chinese armies as teacher of martial arts. Li was said to be a much-loved figure in his community, marrying 23 times and fathering over 200 children.
 
 
According to the generally accepted tales told in his province, Li was able to read and write as a child, and by his tenth birthday had traveled in Kansu, Shansi, Tibet, Annam, Siam and Manchuria gathering herbs. For the first hundred years he continued at this occupation. Then he switched to selling herbs gathered by others. He sold lingzhi, goji berry, wild ginseng, he shou wu and gotu kola along with other Chinese herbs, and lived off a diet of these herbs and rice wine.
 
He Wasn’t The Only One
 
According to one of Li’s disciples, he had once encountered an even older 500-year-old man, who taught him Qigong exercises and dietary recommendations that would help him extend his lifespan to superhuman proportions. Apart from Qigong and a herb-rich diet, what else can we learn from this Master of Longevity?
 
How about this: On his death bed, Li famously said, “I have done all that I have to do in this world”. Could his peaceful last words also hint at one of the biggest secrets to a long and prosperous life? It’s interesting to note that in the West, we’re often taught to believe that aging is something that must be “beaten” with high tech infrared devices and state of the art medication.
 
His Secret To Long Health:
 
Li was asked what his secret was to longevity. This was his reply: “Keep a quiet heart, sit like a tortoise, walk sprightly like a pigeon and sleep like a dog.” These were the words of advice Li gave to Wu Pei-fu, the warlord, who took Li into his house to learn the secret of extremely long life.
 
Li maintained that inward calm and peace of mind combined with breathing techniques were the secrets to incredible longevity. Obviously, his diet would have played a large role. But its fascinating that the old living person in recorded history attributes his long life to his state of mind.
 
Why Is This So Hard To Believe?
 
With the average lifespan for the Western world currently sitting between 70-85 years, the thought of someone living over 100 years old seems like quite the stretch. The thought of someone living over 200 years old seems extremely suspicious. But why don’t we believe that people can live this long?
 
We have to keep in mind that some people in this world don’t live a grueling 9-5 lifestyle, they don’t have to deal with the stresses of debt, they aren’t breathing polluted city air, and they exercise regularly. They don’t eat refined sugars or flour, or any foods that have had pesticides sprayed on them. They aren’t living off of the standard American diet.
 
They aren’t eating fatty meats, sugary deserts, and genetically modified foods. No antibiotics. No alcohol and no tobacco. Their diets not only exclude junk foods that we so often indulge in, they also include superfoods and herbs which are like steroids for our organs and immune system.
 
They also spend their spare time in nature practicing breathing techniques and meditating which have been proven to improve mental, physical, and emotional health. They keep things simple, get proper sleep, and spend a great deal of time in nature under the sun. When we get a chance to relax in the sun, we feel instantly rejuvenated and call this a “vacation”. Imagine spending a lifetime doing that in the mountains, and combining that with perfect mental, spiritual, and physical well-being.
 
I do not doubt for a minute that if we all did the things we knew we were supposed to do, that living to be 100 years old would be commonplace. When we treat our bodies right, who knows how long we can live for?

By Rich Mitchell
Former Alabama Judge Roy Moore bested incumbent Senator Luther Strange in Tuesday’s Alabama primary run-off for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Moore, backed by populist Conservatives Steve Bannon and Dr. Sebastian Gorka won by more than 9 points 54.6% to 45.4% over Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s favored candidate.
The win for Moore comes despite millions from the Senate Leadership Fund directed to Strange by McConnell, tons of negative ads, and the backing of President Donald Trump.
Alabamians saw Strange as the establishment, polished candidate while Moore was seen as a Trumpian man of the people.
Polls had Moore leading the race by as much as 18 points in the three months leading up to voting day with the RCP average at a 10-point lead just days before the vote.
Pundits positioned the race as a test of Trump’s ability to pull in the vote, but even Trump wasn’t sure he’d picked the right candidate to back when he told supporters at a rally for Strange that he “might have made a mistake” in backing the now former Senator.
RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told “Fox and Friends” Wednesday morning that “Voters want to choose their own candidate, they don’t like Washington coming in.”
.@GOPChairwoman on the Alabama GOP Senate runoff: “Voters want to choose their own candidate, they don’t like Washington coming in.” pic.twitter.com/UbRzajjHUk — Fox News (@FoxNews) September 27, 2017
Trump congratulated Roy Moore late Tuesday night once his victory was certain.
“Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama,” he tweeted. “Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race. Roy, WIN in Dec!”
Mitch McConnell voiced his disappointment in the loss after having his PAC spend almost $10 million to support Strange.
“He ran a spirited campaign centered around a dissatisfaction with the progress made in Washington,” leader McConnell said. “I share that frustration.”
Moore now faces Democrat candidate Doug Jones in the Dec. 12 general election – a race Moore is expected to win handily.
The populist win is raising alarms among the establishment GOP.
“If you’re an incumbent, you have to assume the wind is against you,” said consultant Tom Ingram. “If you do run, you take nothing for granted and leave nothing on the table. You start out with one big strike against you: You’re an incumbent Republican senator.”
Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) announced on Tuesday that he would retire in 2018 at the end of his current term. Many of Corker’s possible primary challengers had already begun planning for campaigns to unseat him.
The Senate incumbents up for election next year are John Barrasso (WY), Ted Cruz (TX), Deb Fischer (NB), Dean Heller (NV), Jeff Flake (AZ), Orrin Hatch (UT), and Roger Wicker (Miss.)
Jeff Flake is facing his own anti-establishment backlash after vocally opposing president Trump several times in 2017. Heller and Wicker are also facing serious primary challenges in the 2018 mid-term election.

Iraq refuses talks with Kurds unless they commit to unity,"A Kurdish boy sells banners supporting the referendum for independence for Kurdistan in Erbil, Iraq September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Alaa Al-Marjani
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Iraqi government said on Thursday it would not hold talks with the Kurdish autonomous region on reopening its airports and providing dollars for its banks, unless the Kurds commit to “Iraq’s unity”.
Iraq’s central government imposed a ban on direct international flights to the autonomous Kurdish region after the Kurds held a Sept 25 referendum on independence, which Baghdad says was illegal. It is calling for its neighbors to shut the landlocked region’s borders.
Among other measures to isolate the Kurdish region, Baghdad stopped selling dollars to four Kurdish-owned banks and called for a halt to its independent crude oil sales.
The Kurds have repeatedly called for negotiations following the referendum in which an overwhelming majority voted for independence.
“To avoid this collective punishment, we invite (Iraqi Prime Minister) Haider al-Abadi, again, ... (to) any form of dialogue and negotiations in conformity with the Iraqi Constitution,” the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said in a statement.
It offered discussions “regarding the crossings, internal trade, providing services to the citizens, the banks and the airports.”
But Baghdad has said the Kurds must disavow the referendum result as a pre-condition for any talks. Asked about the latest offer, an Iraqi government spokesman said there could be no talks until the Kurds gave a “commitment to Iraq’s unity”.
The KRG “must accept the sovereign authority of the federal government on (..) oil exports, security and border protection, including land and air entry points,” he told Reuters.
Related Coverage Turkey to close border gates with Northern Iraq in coordination with Baghdad, Tehran: Erdogan spox
The Kurds, who have sought an independent state for generations, say their referendum was meant to be the start of a negotiation that would see them gain independence after agreement with the Iraqi government.
But Baghdad considered the vote illegal, especially as it was held not only in territory that forms part of the Kurdish autonomous region, but also in disputed neighboring parts of Iraq occupied by Kurdish troops.
Iraq has maintained its tough line toward the Kurds with support of neighbors Turkey and Iran, which strongly oppose the secessionist movement. Washington, long friendly with the Kurds, had also called on them before the referendum to cancel it.
President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said on Thursday Turkey would gradually close border crossings with northern Iraq in coordination with the central Iraqi government and Iran.
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim is expected to visit Baghdad on Sunday to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar Abadi.
On Wednesday, the Kurdish authorities accused Iraqi forces and Iranian-trained Iraqi paramilitaries of “preparing a major attack” on the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and the area near Mosul. Both are in parts of northern Iraq outside the Kurdish autonomous region but held by Kurdish forces since Islamic State fighters were driven out. [L8N1MM5J1]
Baghdad has denied it has plans for a military move against the Kurds.
Abadi said on Thursday he would not use the army against the Kurdish region, and a military spokesman denied any attack on Kurdish forces was planned, saying government troops were preparing to oust Islamic State militants from an area near the Syrian border.
“We won’t use our army against our people or to launch a war against our Kurdish citizens,” Abadi said in a statement.
Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council issued arrest warrants on Wednesday for the chairman of the Kurdish referendum commission and two aides for “violating a valid court ruling” banning the independence vote as against the Constitution.
Kirkuk, a Kurdish-held, multi-ethnic city and surrounding province with large oil reserves, has emerged as a flashpoint in the crisis as it is claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds.
Iraqi forces and Shi‘ite Muslim paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, are deployed south and west of Kirkuk, in areas previously under the control of Islamic State.
The Iraqi government spokesman said the KRG must acknowledge the authority of the federal government over Kirkuk as another pre-condition for talks.
The area around al-Qaim, where the Euphrates river crosses into Iraq from Syria, is the last part of Iraq still under the control of Islamic State fighters, who overran a third of the country in 2014.
On Thursday, the Iraqi military dropped leaflets on al-Qaim urging the militants to surrender or face death.
IS also holds areas on the Syrian side of the border, but is retreating there in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi‘ite militias backed by Iran and Russia.
Islamic State’s cross-border “caliphate” effectively collapsed in July when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group’s de facto capital in Iraq, after a nine-month battle."

A few notes, thoughts and links to previous articles on Gang Green to pass along:
Shared this stat in discussing outstanding performances here against the Jaguars but it’s worth repeating. After giving up 7 passing touchdowns of 40 yards or more last season, the longest passing TD the Jets have allowed this season was the 3-yard TD thrown by Jay Cutler against the Dolphins as time expired. It’s early, but hard not to be impressed with what the secondary has done thus far.
against the Jaguars but it’s worth repeating. After giving up 7 passing touchdowns of 40 yards or more last season, the longest passing TD the Jets have allowed this season was the 3-yard TD thrown by Jay Cutler against the Dolphins as time expired. It’s early, but hard not to be impressed with what the secondary has done thus far. Todd Bowles can defend Mo Wilkerson all he wants, but his film and results speak for themselves. Wilkerson looks uninterested in being on the football field. The result? Zero sacks through four games for $18 million. In fact, over his past 20 games, Wilkerson has picked up just 4.5 sacks. In the 20 prior to that, 19 of which were before his new contract, he had 13.5.
When GM Mike Maccagnan signed quarterback Josh McCown, fans in favor of a winless season touted his 2-20 record over his previous 22 starts as reason to believe the Jets were a lock for the top pick. That changed in a hurry, didn’t it?
Still no word on wide receiver Jalin Marshall who is eligible to return from suspension this week. Fans don’t seem to be high on the second-year player, but from the way Todd Bowles has treated Marshall, you get the feeling he’ll do everything he can to keep him on the roster. If he returns, look for the Jets to part with a tight end with five currently on the roster.
Jalin Marshall is eligible to return from his suspension this week
Not much was expected of the Jets this season, but if they can’t find a way to beat Deshone Kizer and the Browns, a lot of the progress that was made over the past two weeks will mean very little. Kizer has made a decent throw here and there, but has been largely ineffective, holding on to the ball too long and missing open receivers when he has a clean pocket. If Mo Wilkerson is going to get a sack at all this season, this is the week to do it.
Of the five tight ends currently on the roster, one of them is rookie Jordan Leggett who has yet to appear in a game due to a knee injury that the team is saying very little about. The rookie says there’s no need to worry, but if the team stays mum and he’s not on the field in the coming weeks, could you blame anyone for doing just that?

Week 5 Rankings (2017): Top 25 Quarterbacks: Newton/Wilson Return To Top 5 & More,"Week 5 Rankings (2017): Top 25 Quarterbacks: Newton/Wilson Return To Top 5 & More
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
We have our first week where we truly have to maneuver around bye weeks, and when coupled with a few injuries (Derek Carr and Marcus Mariota) Week 5 looks to be the most complicated we’ve had to date. Let’s try to sort through all of the questions as we breakdown our rankings for the coming week:
Tom Brady – New England Patriots – at Tampa Bay Aaron Rodgers – Green Bay Packers – at Dallas Russell Wilson – Seattle Seahawks – at Los Angeles Rams Jameis Winston – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New England Cam Newton – Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Carson Wentz – Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Matthew Stafford – Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Dak Prescott – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Green Bay Carson Palmer – Arizona Cardinals – at Philadelphia Alex Smith – Kansas City Chiefs – at Houston Eli Manning – New York Giants – vs. Los Angeles Chargers Philip Rivers – Los Angeles Chargers – at New York Giants Deshaun Watson – Houston Texans – vs. Kansas City Jacoby Brissett – Indianapolis Colts – vs. San Francisco Josh McCown – New York Jets – at Cleveland Jay Cutler – Miami Dolphins – vs. Tennessee Tyrod Taylor – Buffalo Bills – at Cincinnati Marcus Mariota – Tennessee Titans – at Miami Ben Roethlisberger – Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Andy Dalton – Cincinnati Bengals – vs. Buffalo Jared Goff – Los Angeles Rams – vs. Seattle Blake Bortles – Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Joe Flacco – Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland Deshone Kizer – Cleveland Browns – vs. New York Jets Brian Hoyer – San Francisco 49ers – at Indianapolis
Thoughts:
We saw Cam Newton’s 2017 breakout come in Week 4 against the New England Patriots, so you have to love the upside of Jameis Winston in Week 5. He has been impressive through his first three games, as he’s completing 63.0% of his passes (which would be his career best) to go along with 864 yards and 6 TD. He’s exceeded 325 yards in each of the past two weeks, and he could be looking at a third straight. Consider him a Top 5 option.
Speaking of Newton he threw for 316 yards, 3 TD and 1 INT in Week 4 and also rushed for another TD. The Detroit Lions do represent a bit of a tougher matchup (fourth fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks), but that’s solely because they’ve given up little on the ground as well as limited opposing QB to 4 TD vs. 7 INT. They have allowed the ninth most passing yards (1,020) and Newton could easily help to drastically change their overall outlook. Consider him a viable QB1.
Deshaun Watson is coming off a big day, throwing for 283 yards, 4 TD and 1 INT (while also adding a rushing TD). He’s now thrown for 584 yards and 6 TD over the past two weeks, but a matchup with the Chiefs will not be an easy one. He’s more of a high-end QB2, as opposed to a trustworthy QB1.
It would be easy to get behind Ben Roethlisberger, but the Jaguars are allowing the fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks. As the Jets helped to expose on Sunday where you can gash Jacksonville is on the ground, which points to another big day from Le’Veon Bell.
The change in offensive coordinator has obviously had a positive impact on Andy Dalton, who has now thrown for 6 TD vs. 0 INT over the past two weeks. The Bills represent a tough matchup, having allowed 1 TD vs. 6 INT and giving up the second fewest points per week to opposing quarterbacks. It’s easy to get excited, and there’s reason to believe, but he’s more of a QB2 for this one.

The U.S. Government Is Suing People For Requesting Public Records,"By Aaron Kesel
The U.S. government is suing citizens requesting public records all over the country, violating the Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA). The government is stating that it is in “good faith” to take away more of our rights, intimidate us and delay FOIA requests, thus challenging the notion of transparency and, in turn, the Open Government Initiative.
Throughout the U.S. government, a growing number of organizations, school districts, municipalities, and state agencies have filed lawsuits against citizens for making FOIA requests to obtain public information. The governmental bodies argue that they are doing so to let the court decide a matter that isn’t quite clear legally such as when the documents may be shielded by an exemption or privacy laws. But that’s causing problems, and becoming a new way for governments to hide information from taxpayers and even news organizations or individual journalists.
The practice, although highly ridiculed and uncommon, has been going on for years according to Columbia Journalism Review.
However, recently the Associated Press reported three different cases where the government sued citizens in the last year.
In the first case, an Oregon parent Kim Sordyl and journalist Beth Slovic sought details about Portland Public School employees on paid leave. The school board responded by suing them both, arguing that the records are exempt from disclosure due to the personal privacy of employees.
The second case involved two retired teachers, Dr. James Finney and Mike Deshotels, who were sued by Louisiana Department of Education for trying to get information on the school’s enrollment data relating to economically disadvantaged and English proficiency students. The two eventually ended up winning the case in a settlement but not before fighting for their rights in court to even see the data and spending $3,000 in legal fees.
Finally, the third case highlighting this abusive practice that the publication mentioned was Western Kentucky University suing two newspapers. The University filed a lawsuit against its paper, the College Heights Herald and the University of Kentucky campus newspaper, Kentucky Kernel, which sought records related to allegations of sexual harassment and assault involving its faculty. That story titled: “In The Dark: Records shed light on sexual misconduct at Kentucky universities” went on to win the University of Georgia’s Betty Gage Holland Award for excellence in college journalism and using a FOIA request to bring the questionable abuse to light.
“It’s appropriate to say it’s troubling the university (WKU) is suing its own newspaper for practicing good journalism,” attorney Michael Abate told the WKU paper, the College Heights Herald. “Even if they have a valid basis for withholding information, they still have to submit redacted documents.”
In 2015 a New Jersey Judge Michael Winkelstein ruled in favor of Harry Scheeler Jr. who was seeking Hamilton Township police surveillance video and was subsequently sued for his request, Columbia Journalism Review reported. In New Jersey, the state has a law called the Open Public Records Act (OPRA) in place of a Freedom of Information request. The judge ruled that such practices of governments counter-suing citizens was the antithesis of OPRA.
Winkelstein found that,
A government lawsuit against requestors subjects them to involuntary litigation with all of its concomitant financial, temporal, and emotional trimmings. A public policy that gives a government agency the right to sue a person who asks for a government document is the antithesis of the OPRA and common-law policy of providing citizens with a means of access to public information to keep government activities open and hold the government accountable.
Earlier this year in Michigan, the state House voted overwhelmingly 108-0 in favor of a bill that would make it illegal for government agencies to sue citizens who request public records.
The legislation was in response to a local county’s lawsuit against a newspaper that was seeking documents on two employees running for sheriff. A judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying the county had to approve or deny the request.
The bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Klint Kesto, called the lawsuit “a backdoor channel to delay and put pressure on the requester” that circumvents the state’s Freedom of Information Act.
“Government shouldn’t file a lawsuit and go on offense. Either approve the request or deny it,” he said. “This shouldn’t be happening anywhere in the country.”
It’s troubling that so many of these requests have resulted in lawsuits against citizens who have a right to know public information under the Freedom of Information Act.

Russian soldiers face ban on selfies and blog posts,"Image copyright AFP Image caption May 2010: Russian sailors take selfies in the naval base at Sevastopol, Crimea
The Russian defence ministry has drafted a law to ban social media posts by professional soldiers and other military personnel on security grounds.
The bill says photos, videos and other material uploaded to the internet can reveal military details useful to an enemy. Automatic geolocation can show where a military unit is deployed.
The bill affects ""contract"" soldiers, who can be sent abroad, not conscripts.
Russian soldiers' posts have revealed forces deployed to Ukraine and Syria.
For example, in July 2014 the BBC's Myroslava Petsa tweeted an image of a post by a Russian soldier who proudly reported delivering Grad rockets to the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine.
Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March 2014 and the following month the rebels seized a big swathe of Donetsk and Luhansk - mainly Russian-speaking regions in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine and Western governments accuse Russia of supplying heavy weapons and troop reinforcements to the rebels. Russia admits that some Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels, but denies sending regular forces.
In a YouTube video a reporter for Vice News, Simon Ostrovsky, revealed how a Russian soldier's social media posts had enabled him to confirm the Russian military's direct role in the eastern Ukraine fighting.
In August 2014 an article by the Bellingcat investigative team said social media posts by Russian soldiers had confirmed deaths among members of Russia's 76th Airborne regiment in eastern Ukraine. The regiment is based in Pskov, western Russia.
Bellingcat specialises in analysis of social media to document conflicts, including Russia's military role in Syria.
So-called Islamic State (IS) runs a sophisticated social media operation. The jihadists are fighting not only the US-led coalition in Iraq and Syria, but also the Russian forces allied with Syrian government troops.

The Russian defence ministry says two state security bodies - the FSB and FSO - already ban their staff from posting social media content about themselves or their work.
The new ban affecting armed forces personnel is expected to take effect in January 2018, Tass news agency reports.
What selfies reveal
By BBC Technology reporter Chris Foxx
All the major social networks let people share their location when they post photos and messages online.
This can help people find content from a given location, for example the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
Smartphone location data can be very accurate - to within a few metres - and some social networks let you make very specific searches.
It is all too easy to send a tweet without realising location-sharing is switched on, and that could reveal the exact location of troops.
Many people do not realise that photos taken with a smartphone's default camera app often carry embedded location data too.
And of course, a plain old selfie could reveal your location to somebody who recognises what is in the background.
Ukraine's military is also concerned about its soldiers revealing too much on social media.
The Kyiv Post reported those concerns in 2015, when the fighting with pro-Russian rebels was more intense.
""There have been cases where positions were revealed, which led to active shelling,"" said Dmytro Podvorchansky of Ukraine's Dnipro-1 Regiment."
Ranking the Power 5 Football Conferences after Week 3 with Playoff Analysis,"Ranking the Power 5 Football Conferences after Week 3 with Playoff Analysis
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
While the playoff committee doesn’t rank the power 5 conference, there is no way conference strength – which means OOC results doesnt figure in to a committee members thought process.
Let me point out on my philosophy on these rankings – your most recent OOC results count a lot, and you’ll see me reference that throughout the season.
We’ll give each conference a relative strength value 1-10.
Let me explain my relative rankings
0-5 : Conference lacks depth no elite teams
6-7: Conference lacks depth, and there are 1-2 elite teams, and 1-2 quality teams
7-8: At least 2 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams.
8-9: 3 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams
9-10: 1/2 of conference is elite and/or quality teams.
1) Pac 12 – 7.7
Last week provided no real answers about how to rank to the Power 5 conferences. So there’s no reason to modify the rankings from week 3. We’ll stick with the Pac 12 as number 1 due to their 6-2 record against the rest Power 5, but that doesn’t mean there weren’t some ugly results for the Pac 12 last week.
Two ranked Pac 12 teams UCLA and Stanford went down to group of 5 opponents Memphis and San Diego State. California did pick up a nice win over Ole Miss, and USC beat Texas.
Playoff contenders USC and Washington face tricky in-conference opponents Cal and Colorado this week.
Playoff Contenders
USC, Washington
In the Playoff Picture
Utah, Washington State
2) SEC – 7.6
The SEC went a pedestrian 1-2 against the Power 5 last week. Ole Miss lost to Cal, and Missouri got blown out by Purdue. Let’s give Vanderbilt credit for a huge win over a previously ranked Kansas State.
LSU plays Syracuse this week, and I think that game will get ugly for the Orange. The loser of Mississippi State and Georgia will leave the SEC struggling for playoff contenders outside of Alabama. Keep an eye on Alabama vs Vanderbilt this week. If Vanderbilt wins are they SEC’s best team? I’m serious…
Playoff Contenders
Alabama
In the Playoff Picture
Georgia, Mississippi State
3) ACC – 7.6
No surprise Pitt got trounced by Oklahoma State, but Duke did knock off Baylor this past week. Boston College lost to Notre Dame. Clemson looks like one of the country’s 3 best teams after routing Louisville.
The ACC has the 4 top 15 teams the most of any conference.
Syracuse vs LSU is the only OOC matchup.
Playoff Contenders
Clemson
In the Playoff Picture
Miami, Virginia Tech, Florida State
3) Big 10 – 7.5
Rough week for the Big 10 as Nebraska took an embarrassing home loss to North Illinois, and Illinois got routed by South Florida. Purdue did beat Missouri.
The conference lacks any surefire playoff teams at the moment.
This week Notre Dame plays Michigan State, and Maryland has an interesting game with UCF.
Playoff Contenders
NONE
In the Playoff Picture
Penn State, Wisconsin, Michigan
5) Big 12 – 7.3
I said the Big 12 had to go 3-2 in OOC Power 5 games last week to move them up. They went 2-3. Oklahoma State did beat Pitt and Texas Tech defeated Arizona State. Texas played well but lost to USC. Baylor went down to Duke, and surprisingly Kansas State lost to Vanderbilt. Oh yea Kansas lost to Ohio… ouch
Texas Tech plays Houston this week, and a game with playoff implications TCU squares off with Oklahoma State.
Playoff Contenders
Oklahoma
In the Playoff Picture
Oklahoma State, TCU
The Rest
Unless a Group of 5 or independent team can reach the top 15, there’s not much to note outside the Power 5 in terms of the playoff.
Playoff Contenders
NONE
In the Playoff Picture
NONE
My Current Playoff Teams
As my personal criticism of the playoff committee, I don’t think the top 4 seeds order should be released until the final rankings. The playoff committee’s inconsistent and ever changing criteria is causing unnecessary frustration and confusion. It’s one of the improvement points I’d have for them.
If I had a vote this is who I would put in the playoff right now.
In – Oklahoma | Alabama | Clemson | USC
Just Missed – 5) Washington 6) Penn State 7) Oklahoma State 8) Wisconsin

Harvey Weinstein: Oscars academy to hold emergency talks,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dozens of films produced by Harvey Weinstein have won Academy Awards
The hosts of the Oscars are to hold emergency talks to consider the future role of film mogul Harvey Weinstein following claims of sexual misconduct.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said the allegations of sexual assault against Weinstein were ""repugnant"".
Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, has already suspended his membership.
Weinstein strongly denies the allegations against him.
In another development, police in New York told the BBC they were looking to speak to an individual regarding an allegation against Weinstein dating from 2004. The NYPD did not provide further details.
The US academy, which has handed out 81 Oscars to films produced by Weinstein's Miramax studio and the Weinstein Company, said it would meet on Saturday to ""discuss the allegations against Weinstein and any actions warranted by the academy"".

A statement has also been issued by Cannes Film Festival, which Weinstein has attended many times.
President Pierre Lescure said they have been ""dismayed to learn of the accusations"".
""These actions point to a pattern of behaviour that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnation.
""Our thoughts go out to the victims, to those who have had the courage to testify and to all the others. May this case help us once again to denounce all such serious and unacceptable practices.""
Image copyright EPA Image caption Harvey Weinstein attended Cannes Film Festival at times with his wife Georgina Chapman, who has now left him
Meanwhile, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told CNN she felt ""sick"" about the allegations surrounding Weinstein, pledging to donate money he had raised for her campaigns to charity.
Weinstein reportedly raised more than $1.4m (£1.05m) for Democratic groups, and Republicans have accused Democrats of not doing enough to distance themselves from him.
'Powerless and scared'
A string of high-profile actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have come forward to accuse the movie producer of sexual harassment or assault.
British actress and model Cara Delevingne is one of the latest to accuse him of inappropriate behaviour. In a statement, she said he tried to kiss her as she tried to leave a hotel room.
""I felt very powerless and scared,"" she said.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lea Seydoux starred in the Bond film Spectre
The French actress Léa Seydoux has written an article detailing her experience with Weinstein who she met at a fashion show.
She wrote in The Guardian about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink.
""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted.
""I wasn't afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.""
On Tuesday, Weinstein denied allegations of rape made in The New Yorker magazine. On the same day, his wife Georgina Chapman said she was leaving him.
Oscar-nominated actress Annette Bening said Weinstein was well known in Hollywood for being ""boorish"", but that she had not known the extent of his alleged behaviour.
""I certainly didn't know that this was going on to the degree that it was,"" she told BBC News. ""It's terrible. And it's great that these women have come forward. I really respect them. Maybe it's a tipping point. Maybe culturally this means that things will change.""
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch Jez Butterworth's message to Harvey Weinstein
On Wednesday, US prosecutors defended their decision not to take action against Weinstein after a woman complained about his behaviour in 2015.
The Manhattan district attorney's office said undercover audio of the complainant and Weinstein was ""insufficient to prove a crime"".
Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, 22, had gone to police to accuse Weinstein of touching her inappropriately. She then agreed to meet the producer again while wearing a hidden microphone.
The district attorney's office said police arranged the meeting without informing them.
""Prosecutors were not afforded the opportunity before the meeting to counsel investigators on what was necessary to capture in order to prove a misdemeanour sex crime,"" they said.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The New Yorker released audio of an alleged undercover sting operation by New York Police (UK users only)
They said the ""horrifying"" audio ""was insufficient to prove a crime under New York law"" which left prosecutors with ""no choice but to conclude the criminal investigation without charges"".
In the recording, Weinstein can be heard asking Ms Gutierrez to come into his hotel room. The model asks the producer ""why yesterday you touched my breast?"" He apologises, saying he ""won't do it again"".
Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister said: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.
""Mr Weinstein obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.
""Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.""
On Wednesday she declined to comment on reports that Weinstein was intending to travel to Europe to enter a rehabilitation facility.

Harvey Weinstein Is Gone. But Hollywood Still Has a Problem.,"The industry’s silence has historically shielded the men who make movies, including the old studio bosses like Louis B. Mayer to whom Mr. Weinstein has often been nostalgically compared. In histories, these old-studio chiefs are genteelly referred to as womanizers, a polite metaphor for conduct that ranges from time on the casting couch, another odious euphemism, to what sounds a lot like prostitution. According to the historian Scott Eyman, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer — the studio that bore Mayer’s name and boasted that it had more stars than there are in heaven — had a supply “of what were known as ‘six-month-option girls’ to be passed around the executive offices.”
The Weinstein Investigation
If this seems, well, normal it is because this tawdry glimpse into the industry — with its powerful men and passed-around girls — is deeply embedded in its history, its lore and its very identity. It’s the old yet evergreen story of the dewy young woman who comes to Hollywood, does a screen test and maybe signs a contract. The company dyes her hair blonde, feeds her pills and puts her on a diet or under a plastic surgeon’s knife. The lucky ones become Marilyn Monroe (or the It Girl du jour); the luckier ones get out alive. Others remain passed-around girls. The old studio system is gone, but the attitude that exploitation is part of the price for being in the business — hey, it’s Hollywood — endures.

One paradox of Mr. Weinstein’s career is that while he emerged in the independent film world in the 1980s — positioning his earlier company, Miramax Films, as the David to the mainstream’s Goliath — he helped build a media giant that came to resemble an old-fashioned Hollywood studio. In an age of drab bean counters, Miramax had moxie and mystique. Importantly, it had a stable of publicity-ready female stars like Ms. Paltrow and rock-star male auteurs, most notably a favorite of critics, Quentin Tarantino. Sure, Mr. Weinstein might sometimes swing at someone, literally, but in Harveywood misdeeds were soon overshadowed by box-office tallies and savvy public relations.
Peter Biskind, a former editor at the film magazine Premiere, tried to investigate Mr. Weinstein back in 1991, but writes that Miramax threatened to pull its advertising, adding, “the next thing I knew, Harvey was writing columns for Premiere and I was his editor.” Over the years, Mr. Weinstein’s grip on soft-bellied entertainment news media remained firm partly because it was mutually advantageous. And, as he rose, he supported women who supported him. In 2007, he presented a Crystal Award — given by Women in Film — to Renée Zellweger, a star of Miramax titles like “Chicago.”

Given the revelations about Mr. Weinstein, it may seem surprising that his companies also offered actual opportunities for women, including directors like Jane Campion (“The Piano”) and older actresses like Judi Dench (“Shakespeare in Love”). This wasn’t progressive; it was evidence of a shrewd embrace of old-studio-style product diversification. In some ways, it is because Mr. Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, released different kinds of movies and didn’t pour all their resources only into formulas — and male-driven superhero movies — that they gave women opportunities.

Jenni Konner, the co-showrunner for the HBO series “Girls,” has said that the revelations about Mr. Weinstein are a tipping point: “This is the moment we look back on and say, ‘That’s when it all started to change.’” I hope she’s right. One problem is that the entertainment industry is extraordinarily forgiving of those who have made it a lot of money, as Mel Gibson can tell you. It might glance at the fallen comrade on the floor, but only so it can step over the body en route to the next meeting. And if that comrade somehow gets on his feet again, the industry will ask if he has a new project. This forgiveness is often ascribed to the familiar line that the only thing the business cares about is money.
Money often serves as a rationale for some of the industry’s noxiousness, including its sexism and racism: We can’t hire women, blacks, etc., because they don’t sell. Outsiders tend to see the industry as liberal, and while insiders do promote progressive causes, the business hews to a fundamental conservatism. This conservatism shapes its story recycling, its exploitation of women (and men) and its preservation of a male-dominated, racially homogeneous system. Despite pressure, including from the likes of Ava DuVernay and Lena Dunham, the industry resists change. Those in power don’t see an upside in ceding it.
Although the allegations against Mr. Weinstein may not prove to be the necessary tipping point, they are part of growing feminist pressure to change the industry. Activists inside and outside the entertainment bubble are calling out its biases — and showing how those biases affect employment, which in turn affects representations and audiences. (According to The Los Angeles Times, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission — spurred to action by the American Civil Liberties Union — began contacting female film and TV directors in 2015 to see what issues they’re facing.)
I hope real change comes soon, especially for the women working in the industry who each day are forced to fight sexism just so that they can do their jobs. I hope change comes because the movies need new and different voices and visions, something other than deadening, damaging stereotypes and storybook clichés. And I hope change comes for those of us who love movies. I’ve spent a lifetime navigating the contradictions of that love, grappling with the pleasures movies offer with the misogyny that too often has informed what happened behind the camera and what is onscreen. The movies can break your heart, but this isn’t the time only for tears. It is also the time for rage."
"The ""Internet of Things"" Is Sending Us Back To The Middle Ages","Op-Ed by Joshua A.T. Fairfield Professor of Law, Washington and Lee University
Internet-enabled devices are so common, and so vulnerable, that hackers recently broke into a casino through its fish tank. The tank had internet-connected sensors measuring its temperature and cleanliness. The hackers got into the fish tank’s sensors and then to the computer used to control them, and from there to other parts of the casino’s network. The intruders were able to copy 10 gigabytes of data to somewhere in Finland.
By gazing into this fish tank, we can see the problem with “internet of things” devices: We don’t really control them. And it’s not always clear who does – though often software designers and advertisers are involved.
In my recent book, Owned: Property, Privacy and the New Digital Serfdom, I discuss what it means that our environment is seeded with more sensors than ever before. Our fish tanks, smart televisions, internet-enabled home thermostats, Fitbits and smartphones constantly gather information about us and our environment. That information is valuable not just for us but for people who want to sell us things. They ensure that internet-enabled devices are programmed to be quite eager to share information.
Take, for example, Roomba, the adorable robotic vacuum cleaner. Since 2015, the high-end models have created maps of its users’ homes, to more efficiently navigate through them while cleaning. But as Reuters and Gizmodo reported recently, Roomba’s manufacturer, iRobot, may plan to share those maps of the layouts of people’s private homes with its commercial partners.
Security and privacy breaches are built in
Like the Roomba, other smart devices can be programmed to share our private information with advertisers over back-channels of which we are not aware. In a case even more intimate than the Roomba business plan, a smartphone-controllable erotic massage device, called WeVibe, gathered information about how often, with what settings and at what times of day it was used. The WeVibe app sent that data back to its manufacturer – which agreed to pay a multi-million-dollar legal settlement when customers found out and objected to the invasion of privacy.
Those back-channels are also a serious security weakness. The computer manufacturer Lenovo, for instance, used to sell its computers with a program called “Superfish” preinstalled. The program was intended to allow Lenovo – or companies that paid it – to secretly insert targeted advertisements into the results of users’ web searches. The way it did so was downright dangerous: It hijacked web browsers’ traffic without the user’s knowledge – including web communications users thought were securely encrypted, like connections to banks and online stores for financial transactions.
The underlying problem is ownership
One key reason we don’t control our devices is that the companies that make them seem to think – and definitely act like – they still own them, even after we’ve bought them. A person may purchase a nice-looking box full of electronics that can function as a smartphone, the corporate argument goes, but they buy a license only to use the software inside. The companies say they still own the software, and because they own it, they can control it. It’s as if a car dealer sold a car, but claimed ownership of the motor.
This sort of arrangement is destroying the concept of basic property ownership. John Deere has already told farmers that they don’t really own their tractors but just license the software – so they can’t fix their own farm equipment or even take it to an independent repair shop. The farmers are objecting, but maybe some people are willing to let things slide when it comes to smartphones, which are often bought on a payment installment plan and traded in as soon as possible.
How long will it be before we realize they’re trying to apply the same rules to our smart homes, smart televisions in our living rooms and bedrooms, smart toilets and internet-enabled cars?
A return to feudalism?
The issue of who gets to control property has a long history. In the feudal system of medieval Europe, the king owned almost everything, and everyone else’s property rights depended on their relationship with the king. Peasants lived on land granted by the king to a local lord, and workers didn’t always even own the tools they used for farming or other trades like carpentry and blacksmithing.
Over the centuries, Western economies and legal systems evolved into our modern commercial arrangement: People and private companies often buy and sell items themselves and own land, tools and other objects outright. Apart from a few basic government rules like environmental protection and public health, ownership comes with no trailing strings attached.
This system means that a car company can’t stop me from painting my car a shocking shade of pink or from getting the oil changed at whatever repair shop I choose. I can even try to modify or fix my car myself. The same is true for my television, my farm equipment and my refrigerator.
Yet the expansion of the internet of things seems to be bringing us back to something like that old feudal model, where people didn’t own the items they used every day. In this 21st-century version, companies are using intellectual property law – intended to protect ideas – to control physical objects consumers think they own.
Intellectual property control
My phone is a Samsung Galaxy. Google controls the operating system and the Google Apps that make an Android smartphone work well. Google licenses them to Samsung, which makes its own modification to the Android interface, and sublicenses the right to use my own phone to me – or at least that is the argument that Google and Samsung make. Samsung cuts deals with lots of software providers which want to take my data for their own use.
But this model is flawed, in my view. We need the right to fix our own property. We need the right to kick invasive advertisers out of our devices. We need the ability to shut down the information back-channels to advertisers, not merely because we don’t love being spied on, but because those back doors are security risks, as the stories of Superfish and the hacked fish tank show. If we don’t have the right to control our own property, we don’t really own it. We are just digital peasants, using the things that we have bought and paid for at the whim of our digital lord.
Even though things look grim right now, there is hope. These problems quickly become public relations nightmares for the companies involved. And there is serious bipartisan support for right-to-repair bills that restore some powers of ownership to consumers.
Recent years have seen progress in reclaiming ownership from would-be digital barons. What is important is that we recognize and reject what these companies are trying to do, buy accordingly, vigorously exercise our rights to use, repair and modify our smart property, and support efforts to strengthen those rights. The idea of property is still powerful in our cultural imagination, and it won’t die easily. That gives us a window of opportunity. I hope we will take it.

Maximum sustained winds from Nate, the fourth major storm to hit the United States in less than two months, dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour) as it moved through Alabama and into Tennessee.
The remnants of the storm spawned tornado warnings in those states and the western portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. It is forecast to bring gusty winds and up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain to parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York on Monday.
The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph (113 kph) but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.
Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage. “We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” he said.
Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.
Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.
The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall and storm-surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the hurricane center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.
The storm was expected to bring three to six inches of rain to parts of western North Carolina through midday Monday, with up to 10 inches possible in isolated spots. Power outages, damaged homes and roads closed by debris were all reported in the region.
Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.
In Biloxi, water surged over roads during the storm and quickly receded on Sunday, leaving a boat that broke loose marooned on the beach. At a Waffle House restaurant, the storm surge deposited a dumpster in its parking lot.
Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.
“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”
Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.
“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

At the Golden Nugget Casino, one of eight Biloxi gaming establishments, workers rushed to clean up mud, debris and minor damage from 3 feet (1 m) of water sloshing into an entrance and the parkade. The gaming room stayed dry.
Three hundred guests remained in the hotel, some eager to try their luck after surviving Nate.
But dangers from the storm remain, with Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of tornadoes springing up in the Panhandle region and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey urging residents to prepare for strong winds and storm surges.
U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.
Mississippi Power had restored electricity to 10,000 customers, but 4,800 were still without it. More than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Alabama Power said it had restored electricity to 58,000 of 146,000 customers who lost it.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches (25 cm), was expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the hurricane center said.
NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED
Forecast at one point to make landfall in Louisiana, Nate headed farther east and spared many New Orleans parishes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago.
“I had prayed for this - that we would be spared,” said Amos Cormier, president of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana’s equivalent to a county.
Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.
New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he expected that evacuated residents could return home soon.
Vessel traffic and port operations at New Orleans resumed on Sunday afternoon, while the Port of Mobile in Alabama remained closed. Oil ports, producers and refiners in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were planning reopenings as the storm moved inland on Sunday.
The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.
The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.

NFL Picks Week 5,"NFL Picks Week 5
(Before It's News)
Many who stayed up late to watch the end of the Monday night game between the Washington football team and the Kansas City Chiefs saw a bizarre finish that could only be dubbed one thing: the true definition of a bad beat.
Washington attempted to win the game on a bunch of lateral passes. It did not go as planned as Justin Houston eventually scooped up the loose football and took it in for a touchdown as time expired. While it may have seemed like a meaningless touchdown in the game, it had huge ramifications in Vegas. The touchdown led to an epic cover for the Chiefs and the over, while those who bet Washington and the under watched their winnings go down the drain.
If you happened to parlay the Chiefs and the over, it seemed all but over as time ticked away in the fourth. We have seen the lateral plays countless times and they never amount to a score. So many may have already turned their televisions off by that time. Little did they know, they woke up in the morning as a winner. If you did stay awake for the entire game, I am almost guarantee the rush from such a huge win kept you up a lot later than you wanted.
Now imagine if you were on the other side. The feeling inside your stomach as Houston picked that ball up, broke a few tackles and found his way into the end zone is basically a kick to where the sun doesn’t shine. That’s the worst way any gambler can lose a game.
There is a motto for those who dab into the Vegas lines here and there, and that’s “scared money don’t make money.” The bad losses will be there. So, will the epic wins. It’s all about being on the right side every Sunday – and Thursday, and Monday and Saturday later in the season – to make money by the end of the NFL campaign.
I’m here to (hopefully) help you out.
If you’ve followed my writing throughout the years, you have seen that betting lines are something I like to take part in. It’s too easy to pick a winner and a loser each week. Testing your football knowledge against the “pros” in Vegas is more challenging. And what the hell, making a few bucks on the side never hurt anyone.
While we are starting this a few weeks into the NFL season, there is still plenty of time left to finish the year with a profit. Each week, I will give my best bets for the NFL, and of course, which side to take when the Ravens take the field.
Season record: 0-0
*All lines are courtesy of Scores and Odds*
Baltimore Ravens at Oakland Raiders (under 39)
Not the ideal matchup I would like for my first pick of the year, but that has more to do with Oakland losing Derek Carr than anything we have seen from the Ravens. We have no clue what to expect from the Raiders with E.J. Manuel running the offense, but then again, the Ravens don’t have much of an offense either. Both teams will use the ground game to eliminate the sloppy play from their quarterbacks and bank on their defense to make key stops. That’s the perfect scenario when taking the under. Also, it’s important to note that both teams have gone over the total once apiece this season, and the under has hit in three of their last four meetings in Oakland.

Carolina Panthers at Detroit Lions (-2)
Call me crazy, but this could be the best Lions team we have seen under Jim Caldwell. Detroit made Matthew Stafford the highest-paid player in the NFL, but have turned the offense into one where he isn’t forced to throw 50 times a game to win. They also have their best defense in years. Cam Newton and company should be thrilled to get a win in Foxborough, that was more about how bad the Patriots defense is than anything else. The Lions should control this game, and even if Stafford is down late, he’s always good for a comeback.
Arizona Cardinals (+6.5) at Philadelphia Eagles
The Cardinals have been one of the hardest teams to gauge this season. Many felt they could contend for the NFC West, but so far, their two wins are against the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers. Meanwhile, the Eagles have been in highly contested games that have come down to the wire. If this line goes up to 7, it’s one you have to take because Arizona should keep this game respectable. A field goal should win this game, and us some money.
Green Bay Packers (+2.5) at Dallas Cowboys
You might think to yourself that the Cowboys will respond well after losing to the Los Angeles Rams at home last week. It’s anything but as the defense has been brutal to start the season and coming to Jerry’s World is Aaron Rodgers. He will have no problem picking apart a defense that just allowed Jared Goff to throw for 225 yards and two scores. Here’s an interesting nugget to keep in mind also: Dallas is 0-14 ATS as a home favorite coming off a straight up and ATS loss.
These are my four winners for Week 5.
I’ll take a small finder’s fee if you ride the money train with me.
Until next week, SHOW ME THE MONEY!

Puerto Rico got destroyed by Hurricane Maria. But Mayor Carmen Cruz is accused of BLOCKING supplies from dying locals — while she blames Trump.
 
Why isn’t she handing out supplies — and why is Mayor Carmen Cruz wearing a custom T-Shirt?
 
Meanwhile, a “cop” in Puerto Rico telephones an NYC radio station crying about Communism and begging the US Military to take over Puerto Rico.
 
Is this a real humanitarian crisis, made worse by corrupt Puerto Rico politicians? Or is this a ruse to make Puerto Rico the 51st State?
 
After all, if Puerto Ricans are getting abused/starved by their own leaders, doesn’t the US Government need to take over “for the good of humanity?” 
 
Every few years, the Regime tries to make Puerto Rico the 51st State. This would mean millions of new Democrat voters in mainland US elections.
 
But how to justify making Puerto Rico a State? Invading Iraq was “morally justified” by stories of abusive leaders committing “crimes against humanity.” Could taking over Puerto Rico be “morally justified” by tales of diabolical leaders purposely starving their own people? Is that the impression Mayor Cruz is trying to give on CNN?
 
Is that the goal of this “no supplies” scam? American Statehood for Puerto Rico, as State number 51?

Democrats fighting losing battle on Tax Reform,"Democrats fighting losing battle on Tax Reform
(Before It's News)

President Donald Trump released his tax reform plan on Wednesday and Democrats are fighting it with losing talking points.
The plan eliminates state and local income tax deductions which Democrats complain will hurt high-middle income earners in their states. While their claim may be true for areas with exorbitant state and local taxes like New York, Connecticut, Washington D.C., and California, Republican Senators have no chance to win in an election in those regions and should ignore those concerns. If state taxes are so high that residents will find them objectionable once they are actually exposed to them, then voters may begin to understand that Democrats’ tax-and-spend ideology has failed them.
Rep. Steve King (D-NY) said that the deduction is “absolutely essential to my district,” adding that “I can’t vote for a bill that would eliminate the state and local tax deduction.”
“The public will be equally strong against this plan that is so perverse in helping the wealthy and hurting the middle class, and it will fail,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday.
The state and local tax (SALT) deduction forces taxpayers in states with low or no state income taxes to subsidize residents who live in states that elect tax-loving liberals. Federal taxpayers in Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming have to make up for the shortfall in government revenues that the deductions of New Yorkers and Californians cause. Why? Politics.
Local and state officials in liberal states have no qualms voting for additional taxes and increases to taxes knowing that taxpayers in other states will cushion the blow by subsidizing their residents’ hefty tax bills. As long as their constituents keep getting a free meal ticket from more fiscally responsible states, they know their seat is safe.
As we watch the Democrats march out a tidal wave of talking points about “boardroom and country clubs”, “wealth-fare”, “millionaires and billionaires” and Pelosi’s favorite hit on “trickle-down economics” realize that they aren’t really worried about the wealthy getting a tax break, which they won’t, liberals just can’t have their constituents realize just how bad they’ve been screwed.
The SALT deduction is nothing more than a redistribution of wealth. Not from the top to the bottom, but from responsible voters to those less so.

President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that the tax reform vote will be pushed back to 2018.
Trump said that a vote on tax reform and health care could not happen by Friday in part due to Sen. Tom Cochran’s hospitalization.
Senate rules that would allow a 50-vote threshold to pass either measure end Saturday which will push both into next year unless Democrats can be brought in to hit the 60 votes needed outside of reconciliation.
Pushing the tax reform vote into 2018 will likely endanger hopes to make the popular plan retroactive for the 2017 tax year.
Cochran is recovering in a hospital in Mississippi after what his staff calls “a urological issue.”

Review: Shakespeare Meets Elevator Repair Service. Mayhem Ensues.,"Mr. Collins and company have indeed sent in cousins of those clowns to wreak havoc on Shakespeare’s dark comic drama of judgment, mercy and sexual hypocrisy. Sometimes these demolition experts are pretty funny. But if you don’t already know “Measure for Measure” — and it’s an uncommonly hard play to know — you’ll need NoDoz to stay engaged.
Frustration and even defeat are not unusual responses to “Measure for Measure,” which is set in a medieval, vice-ridden Vienna in which fornication before marriage is punishable by death. That law has gone long unenforced when the play begins, so the enigmatic Duke of Vienna (Scott Shepherd) decides to step aside and put the merciless puritan Angelo (Pete Simpson) in charge.
But even as he sends police into the city’s bars and brothels, Angelo is wrestling with illicit desires of his own. He finds himself inconveniently in lust with Isabella (Rinne Groff), a convent novitiate, when she comes to plead for the life of her brother, Claudio (Greig Sargeant), condemned for premarital sex. All the while, the Duke, disguised as a lowly friar, observes from the shadows.
The scholar Harold Bloom has described “Measure for Measure” as a nihilistic “comedy that destroys comedy.” It is a work that combines psychosexual portraiture that anticipates Freud with stock farcical figures like the illiterate cop and various rascally lowlifes. It does not have a single sympathetic character, and every philosophical principle seems to be contradicted by another.
Photo
I usually lower my expectations for “Measure,” which contemporary directors like to trick out in (yawn) S&M and Storm Trooper regalia. The most persuasive version I’ve ever seen, from Fiasco Theater in 2014, refrained from interpretive gloss, and let the play’s paradoxes speak eloquently for themselves. But even in over-conceptualized versions, there’s usually at least one, thought-provoking portrayal that illuminates.
Mr. Collins’s production does feature one such performance, from Mr. Shepherd (more on whom later). Mostly, though, it translates the challenges of a notorious problem play into “oh, why not?” parlor tricks and slapstick.
Much of the intermissionless, two-hours-plus show is conducted at a rushing tempo that defies comprehension. Often, the words being spoken are simultaneously seen (via Eva von Schweinitz’s projections) sliding down the walls of Jim Findlay’s multi-table set, which suggests the shabby boardroom of an underfinanced company.

The performers, wearing Kaye Voyce’s jauntily eclectic costumes, alternately sit, like extras on a movie set, or rush around in high frenzy, scattering papers and props. (I half expected them to start singing, “You say tragedy, I say comedy,” concluding with, “Let’s call the whole thing off.”) And then a silence falls for the Act Three scene in which Isabella explains to Claudio why she cannot sacrifice her maidenhood (to Angelo) to save him from the executioner’s block.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Ms. Groff’s Isabella, dressed to resemble a Tennessee Williams spinster, and Mr. Sargeant’s Claudio speak their exchange plainly and slowly. And it suddenly registers that within all the pious bureaucratic double-talk we’ve been hearing lie matters of genuine life and death. It is an ingeniously placed revelation, and it registers intellectually, if not emotionally.
The lack of affect has to do with the absence of any character definition beyond the archetypal. While I enjoyed the vaudeville neuroses of Mr. Simpson’s Angelo, only one actor told me anything new about “Measure for Measure.”
That’s Mr. Shepherd, whose narrator in “Gatz” was one of the great virtuosic performance of recent years. Here he portrays the “fantastical duke of dark corners” as an exuberant escapee from the House of Windsor, an inbred composite of all the 20th century princes of Wales, including Charles.
This Duke has the enthusiastic but distractible air of a nobleman who has been conditioned to see the world as his personal Erector Set. While his character’s erratic behavior has inspired centuries of debate, Mr. Shepherd suggests that the most accurate interpretation is the simplest.
The Duke acts as he does because he can. He’s the Duke! Like the spoiled and glamorous aristocrats of “The Great Gatsby,” he careers through the lives of lesser mortals, without explanation, leaving others to clean up his mess.
Come to think of it, this feckless man who would be God might have directed the arbitrary production in which he appears."

During Sunday’s NFL parade of schmucks who channeled their resentment that Barack Obama was constitutionally prohibited from a third term and that Colin Kaepernick is jobless into widespread national anthem protests, one man stood tall and is catching hell for it.
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
The entire Pittsburgh Steelers team showed a lack of class and an abundance of cowardice by refusing to even come out of the locker room for the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner.
Except for offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva, a man who actually wore a uniform in service of his country instead of for millions of dollars like his teammates who never had any skin in the game when it came to defending America. He stood at the end of the tunnel with his hand over his heart and became the only Steeler with dignity on a day where it was lacking elsewhere.
Villanueva is a former U.S. Army Ranger who served three tours in Afghanistan and had too much honor to hunker down with the cheese eaters in the locker room, the chief rat being head coach Mike Tomlin.
While Villanueva became a hero to patriotic Americans, the feeling isn’t the same with many of his teammates and the man who is supposed to be their leader.
Tomlin criticized Villanueva during the press conference following the karmic delight of the Steeler’s loss to the pitiful Chicago Bears despite his own lack of focus on the game instead of placating whining baby protesters.
Steelers Coach Didn’t Want Army Vet To Stand For Anthem https://t.co/fKEyivEiMM pic.twitter.com/D6PtTECI7T — The Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 25, 2017
Via The Daily Caller “Steelers Coach Didn’t Want Army Vet To Stand For Anthem”:
Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin indicated Sunday night that he did not want offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva to stand for the national anthem, instead of sitting it out with the rest of his teammates. Villanueva, a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Afghanistan, was the only Steelers player to stand for the anthem. While Villanueva stood in the tunnel, hand over his heart, the rest of the team remained in the locker room in protest of President Trump’s comments that players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired. Tomlin said in a post-game press conference that he was looking for “100 percent participation” in whatever course of action the team took during the national anthem. When asked by a reporter about Villanueva coming out for the anthem, Tomlin said, “Like I said, I was looking for 100 percent participation, we were gonna be respectful of our football team.”
(The comments begin around the 2:10 mark in the video)
Not only did Tomlin’s decision blow up in his face after the veteran Villanueva defied his orders but the player’s jersey sales skyrocketed as will his prestige on a team that not only betrayed its proud history but also chose to allow the lunatics to take over the asylum.
Fans in Pittsburgh won’t be happy with Tomlin, especially now that he has criticized Villanueva for honoring the flag that he risked his life under, something that pampered football types have no clue about.
Some Steelers fans are already burning their team jerseys and memorabilia, it’s not going to be easy for the team to get them back, especially after the Iron City’s pro hockey team the Pittsburgh Penguins upstaged the crybabies in cleats by accepting President Trump’s invitation to the White House.
Tomlin is a crumb who isn’t fit to clean Villanueva’s jockstrap.

Tajik actors get 'beard permits',"Image copyright Akbor/Gulsara Kamolzoda Image caption The Death of the Usurer: The main character's end is a bit hairy
Two stage actors in Tajikistan have been granted temporary permits enabling them to sport facial hair in public.
The wearing of beards is unofficially banned in Tajikistan as part of a crackdown against religious extremism in the largely Muslim country, and the bearded actors were detained by police in the northern town of Konibodom earlier this week.
Khushnud Dado and Farrukh Vaitov were in town to perform a play called ""The Death of the Usurer"" by famous Tajik writer Sadriddin Ayni, news website Sugdnews says.
After the pair explained their motives, police granted them a document permitting them to go out in public wearing facial hair.
""We can freely walk around the town without fear of wearing a beard,"" Akbor news website quoted Mr Vaitov as saying.
Beard crackdown
Shaving beards is part of a government campaign targeting cultural practices deemed ""alien and inconsistent with Tajik culture"".
It has resulted in the arrest of hundreds of thousands of men, and the forcible shaving of nearly 13,000 men in one Tajik region alone.
The authorities initially blamed the campaign against beards on local police, but now they acknowledge that the drive is aimed at curbing religious extremism amid fears it could spread from neighbouring Afghanistan.

Disney's Tiffany Thornton defends remarrying two years after husband died,"(CNN) A former Disney Channel star has struck back at online commenters who are questioning her new marriage less than two years after her first husband died.
Tiffany Thornton, who starred on ""Sonny with a Chance,"" lost her first husband, musician Chris Carney, in a car accident in Hot Springs, Arkansas in December 2015.
Thornton married Carney, who starred on the MTV reality series ""twentyfourseven,"" in 2011 and the couple had two children together.
On Saturday Thornton married Arkansas worship pastor Josiah Capaci and called it the ""Best day of my life"" on an Instagram photo of her and her new husband.
Best day of my life 10/7/17 A post shared by Tiffany Thornton (@tiffthornton) on Oct 7, 2017 at 8:44pm PDT
Soon after that Thornton, 31, addressed the haters in the caption of another Instagram image of her and Capaci on their wedding day.
""This. This is love. That all encompassing, enduring, accepting, near perfect love,"" Thornton wrote. ""The kind that trumps my need to snap back at people who have the audacity to comment on my Instagram about whether I loved my first husband or not.""
This. This is love. That all encompassing, enduring, accepting, near perfect love. The kind that trumps my need to snap back at people who have the audacity to comment on my Instagram about whether I loved my first husband or not. But let me take a moment to explain something to you. There is no timeline for grief or for when God moves in your life in undeniable ways. There are a lot of people who think it isn't good to be transparent on social media but I say forget that. I'm going to be open and honest because God wants me to. It's part of my testimony and it needs to be said. I was a mess yesterday during our wedding ceremony. So many emotions flooded my heart as I walked down those balcony steps to the arms of my gift from God. I thought of Chris watching us and knowing he would have loved the choice I made, for me and for the boys. I thought of Chris's amazing parents sitting front row and how much of a blessing they have been and will forever be in our lives. How happy they are for the boys and I and how much they already love Josiah. I am so completely humbled by the love I receive from this man. Jo came along EXACTLY when God knew I needed him. It wasn't my choice to fall in love so quickly after chris passed but I was growing so comfortable with being alone that it was becoming unhealthy. Looking back now I think God saw that if I went too long without love that it would become increasingly difficult for me to submit to the authority of a husband after being set in my own ways. When I say ""Jo is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me"" that in no way indicates that I didn't love my first husband with all that I had. How dare any one of you judge me and say that on a social platform. It doesn't make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers. I will always love chris and jo knows that. And I will always love Jo. The beautiful thing about love is that it multiplies as new blessings come into your life. I don't have to share one bucket of love with the special people in my life. Each one has their own bucket. Get it? Isn't that amazing?? God's timing is not our own. And I praise Him for that. You should too. A post shared by Tiffany Thornton (@tiffthornton) on Oct 8, 2017 at 6:49am PDT
She went on to say ""There is no timeline for grief or for when God moves in your life in undeniable ways"" and said she was extremely emotional walking down the aisle.
""I thought of Chris watching us and knowing he would have loved the choice I made, for me and for the boys,"" she wrote."" I thought of Chris's amazing parents sitting front row and how much of a blessing they have been and will forever be in our lives.""
""It wasn't my choice to fall in love so quickly after Chris passed but I was growing so comfortable with being alone that it was becoming unhealthy,"" she continued. ""Looking back now I think God saw that if I went too long without love that it would become increasingly difficult for me to submit to the authority of a husband after being set in my own ways.""
Thornton called Capaci the ""greatest thing that's ever happened to me"" and said her new marriage ""in no way indicates that I didn't love my first husband with all that I had.""
""It doesn't make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers,"" she said. ""I will always love Chris and Jo knows that. And I will always love Jo. The beautiful thing about love is that it multiplies as new blessings come into your life."""
Liberians vote to bolster peaceful democracy in presidential poll,"Two observers are seen during presidential elections at a polling station in Monrovia, Liberia, October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon
MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberians voted on Tuesday in an election expected to mark the first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades in a country haunted by a civil war that ended nearly 15 years ago.
Outgoing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, is praised for maintaining peace since taking over after the end of the West African country’s 14-year conflict in which child fighters were used.
Liberia’s policy of prioritizing reconciliation over justice, however, has meant that prominent figures responsible for the violence that killed a quarter of a million people are still present on the political landscape.
There is no clear frontrunner but Prince Johnson, a former rebel leader who finished third in the last election in 2011, is among 20 candidates on the ballot.
The ex-wife of warlord-turned-president Charles Taylor, now imprisoned in the UK for war crimes committed in Sierra Leone, is the running mate of another favorite: former soccer star George Weah.
“I am just voting for peace. We want peace right now,” said James Marthics, a voter in Paynesville, a suburb of the capital Monrovia.
Residents queued before dawn at polling stations in Monrovia, some bringing small wooden chairs with them, and formed queues as vendors sold them soft drinks and palm wine.
Materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls. State broadcaster ELBC reported a party chair in Lofa County was detained for distributing money to voters.
Elections commission head Jerome Korkoya said some individuals were arrested for trying to vote more than once, but he said voting went smoothly overall.

Liberia is Africa’s oldest modern republic. It was founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer dates back to 1943.
Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first elected female president, won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post-war transition. She was re-elected in 2011 but is barred from seeking another term.
Among the favorites to replace her is Vice President Joseph Nyuma Boakai.

Weah, who has won FIFA’s world player of the year, was greeted at his polling station by supporters in football shirts. He came second to Johnson Sirleaf in 2005.
Ex-rebel leader Johnson won around 12 percent of the vote in 2011. A widely-circulated video showed him sipping a beer as he directed the torture of President Samuel Doe shortly before his murder in 1990.
Ballot counting started soon after polls officially closed at 6 p.m. (1800 GMT), though voting continued in some areas where there had been delays.
Results are expected to begin arriving later this week. But most analysts think it will be difficult for any single candidate to win an outright majority on Tuesday, raising the likelihood of a run-off election next month.
Few believe there is a real risk of a return to war but in a national address on Monday Johnson Sirleaf called for peace.
Though held in high esteem internationally, many Liberians, who call her simply “Ellen”, say they are disappointed she has not achieved more in her 12 years in office.
Liberia is currently 177th out of 188 countries ranked by the U.N. human development index, and Johnson Sirleaf has faced accusations of nepotism and failing to crack down on corruption."
Trump Threatens N.F.L. and Attacks Jemele Hill of ESPN,"Mr. Trump on Tuesday also focused his fire again on Jemele Hill, the “SportsCenter” host on ESPN who previously called the president a white supremacist. Ms. Hill was suspended on Monday for suggesting that fans boycott advertisers of the Dallas Cowboys after the team owner, Jerry Jones, threatened to bench players who knelt during the national anthem.
“With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have ‘tanked,’ in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.
ESPN has faced significant challenges recently and is now available in just under 88 million homes, compared with 100 million homes in 2011. In the first half of 2017, its prime-time ratings were up 1 percent compared with the same period in 2016, although its total day ratings were down more than 5 percent. But ESPN is still a ratings behemoth and still highly profitable. In the third quarter, it led full-time cable networks in total day and prime-time ratings among the key demographics of men ages 18 to 54.
The president continues to be animated by his fight with the sports world. He has enthusiastically kept up his attacks on the N.F.L., with which he has a long history of antagonism. A onetime owner of the New Jersey Generals in the upstart United States Football League, Mr. Trump persuaded other owners to sue the N.F.L. using antitrust law. The U.S.F.L. won the case, but the jury awarded only $1 in damages — tripled to $3 by law — and Mr. Trump’s league ultimately folded.
The N.F.L.’s tax exemption has long been controversial. The league’s 32 teams are for-profit businesses that pay taxes accordingly, but the central office became a nonprofit organization decades ago. In response to the criticism, the league in 2015 voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status because of what it called the “distraction.”
It is not clear that it cost the league much money. While the league as a whole generates billions of dollars in revenue a year, the league office ran a deficit of $13.5 million in the fiscal year that ended a year before the decision to give up the tax-exempt status. But the change meant the league no longer had to disclose what it paid its commissioner, Roger Goodell.

Last month, after the kneeling controversy erupted, a Republican congressman, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, introduced legislation stripping professional sports leagues of tax-exempt status, an idea that has been debated on Capitol Hill for years.
In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Joe Lockhart, the N.F.L. spokesman, said the league receives no “massive” tax breaks, as Mr. Trump contended.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Regarding the player protests, Mr. Lockhart said the league’s 260-page game operations manual has not changed and he highlighted the precise language governing the anthem. The players, he said, “must” be on the sidelines during the playing of the anthem and “should” stand for the anthem. The league, however, has “not chosen to discipline any of the players” who have not stood for the anthem, he said.
That might change next week, though, when the owners meet in New York, where the anthem protests will be on the agenda. Mr. Goodell and the owners want the players to stand “because we think it’s an important part of the game,” Mr. Lockhart said, and “there’s a strong feeling at every level that we ought to be getting back to football.”
Sports teams have benefited in other ways under tax law. Many franchises have built new stadiums in cooperation with cities and states that floated bonds to finance construction. Municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes, leading critics to complain that taxpayers are subsidizing profitable private businesses. Mr. Lockhart said local government subsidies hade been an “economic engine” for those communities.
A study by the Brookings Institution last year concluded that three dozen sports franchises from the N.F.L., Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League had financed stadiums since 2000 using tax-exempt municipal bonds.
The biggest beneficiary was not a football franchise but the New York Yankees, the president’s hometown baseball team, which Brookings estimated saved $492 million as a result. Among the football owners who have benefited from such bonds was Mr. Trump’s friend Mr. Jones, whose Dallas Cowboys saved $88 million in building AT&T Stadium.
It was unclear how Congress might prohibit states, counties and cities from deciding how to spend their tax revenue, or whether it could undo deals that were approved years ago. It is also unclear whether it would be possible for legislators to target teams in one league, like the N.F.L., and not another, like Major League Baseball.
The federal government has limited room to act against the N.F.L. in other areas. The league has all but abandoned its policy of blacking out games in home markets when teams fail to sell out their stadiums, giving the Federal Communications Commission less oversight over professional football. The league, however, does have something akin to an antitrust exemption, thanks to a 1966 law, that allows every team to band together to negotiate television deals.
As part of his campaign against sports figures who have criticized him, the president on Tuesday hosted the N.H.L. champions at the White House. He invited the Stanley Cup winning Pittsburgh Penguins a day after disinviting the Golden State Warriors of the N.B.A. because its star, Stephen Curry, said he would vote against attending."

Trump finds his voice in Vegas after stumbling in Puerto Rico,"Las Vegas (CNN) When President Donald Trump sought to bring comfort to this shell-shocked city Wednesday , the contrast with his paper-towel tossing visit to Puerto Rico Tuesday could not have been more stark.
One was jarring in its display of Trump's defensive and juvenile behavior against a backdrop of death and desperation. The other was measured and presidential.
The President, who arrived at University Medical Center of Southern Nevada trauma center on Wednesday, was gracious and deferential. One nurse recalled how he greeted first responders by gripping them on both arms, leaning in with warmth to tell them how grateful he was.
He and first lady Melania Trump went room to room to talk to each of the 10 patients he visited and their families. He asked for their stories of how they survived as the hail of bullets rained down from the gunman. He wanted to know about their favorite country stars, whether they heard the gunshots, how they escaped the venue, whether they had arrived at the hospital in pickup trucks. He invited them to ""drop by"" the White House when they were in Washington, one doctor said.
""It was like talking to your next door neighbor,"" said Dr. John Fildes, who heads UMC's department of surgery and led the Trumps on their tour Wednesday.
The CEO of the hospital, Mason Van Houweling, noted that Trump comforted victims who had lost friends and family members. He met with more than 100 staff members, including an environmental technician who mopped ""gallons of blood"" from the emergency room floor in the midst of the madness.
""He was a real statesman today,"" said Van Houweling told CNN in an interview outside the emergency room, adding that the President ""gave lots of hugs"" and took selfies with anyone who asked. ""He spent lots of time with (the victims). He was not rushed by any means.""
""I heard a lot of laughing"" from the rooms, he said, describing how the President joked with the patients and sought to lift their spirits.
Wild swings
JUST WATCHED Towel tossing Trump in Puerto Rico Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Towel tossing Trump in Puerto Rico 02:00
No one really knows exactly what drives the wild swings in Trump's behavior from one day to the next. But Wednesday's visit illustrated his ability for compassion and the ease with which he can slip into the traditional presidential role.
Famously thin-skinned and enraged by criticism, he is at his worst when he is on the defense -- as he was in Puerto Rico.
In that hurricane-ravaged American territory, Trump's public comments centered on his need for adulation -- and his desire to combat the press narrative that it was an island abandoned by the federal government
There the President insisted that the federal response deserved ""an A+"" even as the death toll climbed to nearly three-dozen people, and most of the population was still living without electricity or running water. There he tossed paper towels to onlookers as though they were prizes as a sporting event, and held up a can of tuna as if it was a gift he had bestowed on the people there.
He made crass comparisons between the death toll in Puerto Rico and the number of people who died in Hurricane Katrina.
The President also placed blame on locals for not working hard enough on behalf of their own recovery, statements that critics seized upon as racially charged against the Hispanic residents of Puerto Rico.
There is no question that Trump felt more comfortable Wednesday in Las Vegas, surrounded by police, doctors and other first responders.
""What I saw today is just an incredible tribute to professionalism, and what they have done is incredible. And you never want to see it again, that I can tell you,"" Trump said shortly before leaving the hospital.
He said the deaths of the 58 people who perished at the country music festival Sunday night should ""inspire all of us to show more love every day for the people who grace our lives.""
""In the months ahead, we will all have to wrestle with the horror of what has unfolded this week, but we will struggle through it together, we will endure the pain together, and we will overcome together as Americans,"" Trump said after recounting the stories of men and women who saved lives on Sunday.
'We are defined by our love'
JUST WATCHED Trump: America is truly a nation in mourning Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: America is truly a nation in mourning 01:02
Speaking with first responders, Trump urged Americas not to ""be defined by the evil that threatens us or the violence that incites such terror.""
""We are defined by our love, our caring and courage,"" Trump said. ""In the darkest moments, what shines most brightly is the goodness that thrives in the hearts of our people. That goodness is our lighthouse, and our solace is knowledge that the souls of those who passed are now at peace in heaven.""
When asked whether he had worked with someone on his speech, his spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said ""those were the President's remarks.""
""He was very personally engaged and committed to doing it, he felt like it was really important,"" she told reporters on Air Force One.
In interviews, hospital personnel who accompanied Trump on Wednesday said he had met the commander in chief test. Van Houweling said Melania Trump remained at his side throughout the visit and was a ""calming presence"" to everyone she met.
Barbara Brummel, an oncology nurse coordinator who helped tend to wounded, described the excitement among the patients about meeting the President, and how some of them had dressed up to the best of their ability while wearing hospital gowns.
Brummel, a mother of three and grandmother of two, said she told the first lady she admired her because ""it's so hard to be a mom and do the jobs that we do.""
""(Melania Trump) said 'Yes, being a mother is one of the hardest jobs in the world,' "" Brummel recounted."
"10 Important Stories From 09/28/17 Box Scores: Is Pham For Real, The Outlook For E. Rodriguez & More","10 Important Stories From 09/28/17 Box Scores: Is Pham For Real, The Outlook For E. Rodriguez & More
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
It was a dominant performance from Carlos Carrasco, who tossed 8.1 shutout innings allowing 6 H and 1 BB while striking out 14 (and only needing 112 pitches to get there). Carlos Correa filled the box score, going 4-4 with 1 HR, 3 RBI and 3 R (finishing a triple short of the cycle). Giancarlo Stanton is making his push for 60 HR, going 3-4 with 2 HR, 3 RBI and 3 R. What else happened on the field that we need to know about? Let’s take a look:
1) Is Jason Kipnis rediscovering himself…
It’s basically been a lost season for Kipnis, who is hitting .232 with 12 HR and has missed significant time due to injury. He did get the Indians going yesterday though, going 1-4 with 1 HR, 2 RBI and 1 R, and now has hits in five of his past six games (7-20 with 1 HR, 5 RBI and 2 R). It’s promising, and there’s obviously reason to believe that he would improve upon his .258 BABIP if he had the time (.315 for his career). He also has continued to show an ability to make more than enough contact, with a 19.6% strikeout rate. Maybe he doesn’t bring the stolen base potential that he once did, but he appears primed to be a solid bounce back candidate heading into 2018.
2) Does Jacob Faria hold future appeal…
He clearly didn’t pitch much as he’s worked his way back, throwing a total of 8.0 innings in his three September appearances. He didn’t end on a high note, allowing 3 R (2 earned) on 4 H and 2 BB, striking out 2, over 3.0 IP against the Yankees. The problem was 2 HR allowed, and that’s the big red flag hanging over him. He generated 2 groundballs vs. 4 fly balls last night, after entering the day with a 38.7% groundball rate. He had a 1.07 HR/9 at Triple-A prior to his recall, and as his number in the Majors rises (as well as a regression in his .266 BABIP and 78.1% strand rate entering the day) the value will plummet. He’s usable and a backend option entering ’18, but don’t make the mistake of valuing him more than that.
3) Tyler Glasnow walks the ballpark…
The Pirates split the game, with Ivan Nova taking the first 2.0 IP and then handing the ball off to Glasnow. No one is going to question the upside of the once top prospect, but there are obviously significant issues. He went 3.2 innings allowing 1 R on 2 H and 5 BB, striking out 2, and has now walked 15 batters over his past 7.2 IP. In 62.0 innings in the Majors this season he owns a 6.39 BB/9, and while it looked like he turned a corner at Triple-A (3.09 BB/9) we can’t ignore his 5.04 BB/9 in 110.2 IP at Triple-A last season (and 5.01 in 23.1 IP in the Majors). Until he can consistently throw strikes he’s simply not going to be a trusted option, and as we head into 2018 he’s a high upside flier and nothing more.
4) A disastrous finish for Eduardo Rodriguez…
Taking on the Astros he allowed 5 ER on 6 H and 2 BB, striking out 2, over 1.2 IP. He had been stringing together a few good starts, but at the end of the day he ends the year allowing 5 ER in three of his final seven starts and the owner of a 4.19 ERA and 1.28 WHIP. No one is going to question his ability to generate strikeouts and his control is solid, but home runs are an issue (1.25 HR/9, courtesy of a 34.9% groundball rate). With nothing unbelievable about his luck metrics (.299 BABIP, 74.5% strand rate) it’s fair to say that this simply is what he is. That has value, but don’t view him as anything different.
5) An appropriately poor finish for Julio Teheran…
Taking on the Marlins Teheran allowed 5 ER on 8 H and 3 BB, striking out 3, over 6.0 IP to finish the disappointing year with a 4.49 ERA and 1.35 WHIP. We all know that the biggest issue this season has been home runs (1.48 HR/9), but that’s not the sole reason for his struggles. He simply wasn’t getting as many swings and misses as usual (9.4% SwStr%) and his pinpoint control wasn’t there (3.44 BB/9). There’s going to likely be reason to believe in a rebound in 2018, though it’s hardly a given. He’ll be a pitcher we take an extremely close look at in the offseason before drawing any definitive conclusion.
6) The value of Tommy Pham continues to grow…
He went 2-4 with 1 R and 2 SB yesterday, putting him at .311 with 23 HR, 73 RBI, 93 R and 25 SB in what can only be described as a highly impressive performance. Can we expect him to even reasonably come close to those numbers again, though? The two red flags are his .373 BABIP and 26.7% HR/FB, both of which can easily regress. That said he’s shown the potential to be a 20/20 player and also has impressive plate discipline (7.5% SwStr%, 19.1% O-Swing%). Maybe he does take a step back, but he’s proven that he’s going to hold value moving forward.
7) A strong finish from Sean Manaea…
It came against the Rangers, which at this point is a favorable matchup for any pitcher, but he still allowed just 1 R (0 earned) on 3 H and 3 BB, striking out 6, over 6.2 IP to finish the year at 12-10 with a 4.37 ERA and 1.40 WHIP. Obviously the overall numbers aren’t impressive, though part of his issues were tied to poor luck (.318 BABIP, 69.6% strand rate). He offers more upside in the strikeout department, given his 11.3% SwStr%, and things really went off the track in the second half (.350 BABIP, 67.7% strand rate, 6.47 K/9). Pitching in Oakland with the skills he brings, he’ll once again carry breakout potential heading into 2018 and could be an ideal post-hype sleeper.
8) Things going south for Yoan Moncada…
He was impressing for a while, but things have unsurprisingly taken a bit of a turn in recent days. Last night he went 0-3 with 2 K, and over his past seven games he’s gone 5-30 with 13 K. Overall in September he’s struck out 29 times in 87 AB and owns a 33.3% strikeout rate over 219 PA in the Majors. He brings power and speed, but until he figures out how to make consistent contact (12.7% SwStr%) the total value just isn’t going to be there. It doesn’t mean that he should be written off, but with high expectations you are going to have to proceed with caution next season.
9) Nick Castellanos continues to finish strong…
He went 2-4 with 3 RBI yesterday, putting him at .377 with 6 HR and 23 RBI in September alone. Overall he’s hitting an impressive .274 with 25 HR (as well as 6 doubles and 10 triples) with 99 RBI as he appears to be figuring things out. He’s maintained his ability to hit the ball hard (24.7% line drive rate) and he’s proven that last year’s power breakout is for real (13.7% and 14.0% HR/FB the past two seasons). He could still use some improvement in his plate discipline, with a 13.3% SwStr% and 34.9% O-Swing%, but at 26-years old next season he could have another career year ahead of him.
10) Danny Duffy goes out with a whisper…
Taking on the Tigers he allowed 4 ER on 6 H and 3 BB, striking out 4, over 4.1 IP to finish the year with a 3.81 ERA and 1.26 WHIP. Over his final two outings he managed just 6 K vs. 5 BB over 10.1 IP, though that shouldn’t take away from his overall strong showing in ’17 (8.00 K/9, 2.52 BB/9). The obvious red flag is his 39.5% groundball rate and 0.80 HR/9, but improvements in his .309 BABIP and 71.3% strand rate would help to offset any home run regression. He may not be an ace, but he does have that upside and should be a Top 40 starter heading into ’18.

British novelist Ishiguro wins Nobel Literature Prize,"Kazuo Ishiguro, the Japanese-born British novelist who in ""The Remains of the Day,"" ''Never Let Me Go"" and other novels captured memory's lasting pain and dangerous illusions in precise and elegant prose, won the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.
The selection of the 62-year-old Ishiguro marked a return to citing fiction writers following two years of unconventional choices by the Swedish Academy for the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize. It also continues a recent trend of giving the award to British authors born elsewhere — V.S. Naipaul, the 2001 winner, is from Trinidad and Tobago; the 2007 honoree, Doris Lessing, was a native of Iran who grew up in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).
""Some of the themes that I have tried to tackle in my work — about history, about not just personal memory but the way countries and nations and communities remember their past, and how often they bury the uncomfortable memories from the past — I hope that these kinds of themes will actually be in some small way helpful to the climate we have at the moment,"" Ishiguro said Thursday, speaking in his backyard in north London.
Ishiguro already was one of Britain's most celebrated writers, winning the Booker for ""The Remains of the Day,"" receiving an Order of the British Empire medal and appearing frequently on lists of the country's greatest authors. The academy called Ishiguro's eight books, which also include ""An Artist of the Floating World"" and ""The Buried Giant,"" works of emotional force that uncover ""the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world.""
Many know him best for ""The Remains of the Day,"" a million-seller published in 1989 and, thanks to the Nobel, in the top 10 Thursday on Amazon.com. Ishiguro's novel reads like a darker take on P.G. Wodehouse's comic Jeeves stories, with a butler at a grand house looking back on a life in service to the aristocracy. The gentle rhythms and ""Downton Abbey""-style setting gradually deepen into a haunting depiction of the repressed emotional and social landscape of 20th-century England and the deadly rise of fascism so many failed to perceive or prevent.
""What can we ever gain in forever looking back and blaming ourselves if our lives have not turned out quite as we might have wished?"" Ishiguro writes. ""The hard reality is, surely, that for the likes of you and I, there is little choice other than to leave our fate, ultimately, in the hands of those great gentlemen at the hub of this world who employ our services.""
Ishiguro would explain that he saw the butler as a metaphor for both emotional and political detachment. An Associated Press review from the time noted that ""Ishiguro neatly reverses the cliche of 'what the butler saw' by building a novel around what the butler didn't see."" Salman Rushdie later wrote that ""Just below the understatement of the novel's surface is a turbulence as immense as it is slow; for 'The Remains of the Day' is in fact a brilliant subversion of the fictional modes from which it seems at first to descend. Death, change, pain and evil invade the innocent Wodehouse-world.""
The 1993 film adaptation by the Merchant-Ivory production team starred Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson and was nominated for eight Academy Awards.
Like ""The Remains of the Day,"" his 2005 novel ""Never Let Me Go"" is a story of deception and uncertainty. What appears to be a narrative of three young friends at a boarding school gradually reveals itself as a dystopian tale with elements of science fiction that asks unsettling ethical questions. The movie adaptation starred Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley.
""I've always liked the texture of memory,"" Ishiguro told www.writerswrite.com around the time ""Never Let Me Go"" came out.
""I like it that a scene pulled from the narrator's memory is blurred at the edges, layered with all sorts of emotions, and open to manipulation. You're not just telling the reader: 'this-and-this happened.' You're also raising questions like: Why has she remembered this event just at this point? How does she feel about it? And when she says she can't remember very precisely what happened, but she'll tell us anyway, well, how much do we trust her?""
The Swedish Academy stunned the literary world last year by giving the prize to Bob Dylan, while in 2015 it offered a rare spotlight for nonfiction writers by honoring Belarusian journalist Svetlana Alexievich. Ishiguro's preferred art form is fiction, but he works in other media. He has written several screenplays, including for the Merchant-Ivory release ""The White Countess,"" and has collaborated on songs performed by jazz singer Stacey Kent. He also contributed liner notes for Kent's album ""In Love Again.""
""Songwriting was an old passion of mine. Earlier in my life I'd been a singer-songwriter until I turned to fiction,"" Ishiguro, who has called Dylan one of his early heroes, told the Independent in 2013.
Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki but moved to England as a boy after his father, an oceanographer, was invited by the head of the British National Institute of Oceanography. An admirer of ""Jane Eyre"" from early on, he also is a longtime fan of comics and said Thursday that he was ""in discussions"" about working on a graphic novel. ""This is a new thing for me and reconnects me to my childhood, my Japanese childhood of reading manga,"" he explained.
He studied English and philosophy at the University of Kent and found an early mentor in Malcolm Bradbury, who taught creative writing at the University of East Anglia. After a few false starts, Ishiguro completed his first novel, ""A Pale View of Hills,"" narrated by a Japanese woman whose daughter has committed suicide. Both his debut work and the Booker-nominated ""An Artist of the Floating World"" centered on Japanese characters.
""I discovered that my imagination came alive when I moved away from the immediate world around me,"" he told the Paris Review in 2008, recalling that his fiction was well received in his creative writing class.
""When I tried to start a story: 'I came out of Camden Town tube station and went into McDonald's and there was my friend Harry from university,' I couldn't think of what to write next. Whereas when I wrote about Japan, something unlocked. One of the stories I showed the class was set in Nagasaki at the time the bomb dropped, and it was told from the point of view of a young woman. I got a tremendous boost to my confidence from my fellow students. They all said, 'This Japanese stuff is really very exciting, and you're going places.'""

Catalan independence push puts Spanish border town on edge,"The river that runs through San Rafael del Rio, a quiet rural town with a population of just over 500, provides a natural boundary between the Spanish regions of Catalonia and Valencia. Now residents are worried that the escalating conflict between Spanish and Catalan authorities will split the town in two.
""People are nervous and scared because they feel this is a free-fall,"" said Guadalupe Espinosa, a 47-year-old psychologist who lives on the Catalan side of the river. ""I don't like armies or borders, but maybe we will have one here. Who knows?""
Catalan leaders have said they will declare independence for the northeastern region after receiving overwhelming support for secession in a weekend referendum that Spain declared illegal and tried to stop by force. That could have particular implications for San Rafael, where the border cutting through the town until now has been a mere curiosity.
Most of San Rafael, including the town hall, is in the Valencia region, which has no plans to leave Spain. But it shares with Catalonia irrigation, roads, electricity supply and even the phone dialing prefix. Mayor Domingo Giner downplayed the conflict's impact on the town, saying neighbors on either side of the Senia river co-exist peacefully.
""The town has other problems beyond defining its territorial entity,"" said Giner, a 55-year-old pig farmer who represents the conservative Popular Party of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. ""We need to respect each other. Our residents understand Catalonia is part of them.""
There was no outward sign of conflict this week in San Rafael, where a fountain sputtered peacefully on the main plaza as the occasional tractor rumbled by. A 100-meter (100-yard) bridge connects the main part of town with the Castell neighborhood on the Catalonian side. Some residents said they got along just fine, even though some identified as Catalans and others as Spaniards.
""Valencia and Catalonia are different, but even though the border exists, it's the same town,"" 20-year-old lifeguard Natzari Reverte said.
But others, especially those old enough to remember Spanish dictator Gen. Francisco Franco's crackdown on separatism, said tensions have risen in recent years amid the growing animosity between Catalonia's pro-independence leaders and the Spanish government in Madrid.
""I have a brother who is pro-independence but we can't talk about it, because it gets tense, and I don't want to fight,"" said Hector Reverter, a 74-year-old retiree having pre-lunch beers with friends at a gas station restaurant on the outskirts of the town.
Only those living on the Catalan side were able to vote in the referendum, casting their ballots in the nearby Catalan town of Ulldecona. According to preliminary results, about 90 percent of ballots cast were for independence, but many opponents are believed to have ignored the referendum. Turnout was around 40 percent.
Reverter lives on the Catalan side but opposes independence and said he would move to the Spanish side if the river were turned into the external boundary of an independent Catalonia.
""I don't want to see any border,"" Reverter said. ""I want to die and not see it."""

Ceremony to Take Place During Halftime of Legends Homecoming Game with over 75 Jets Legends Expected to Attend
Three Jets to Receive Hall of Fame Ring of Excellence Pregame
September 26, 2017 – The New York Jets will induct former center and perennial Pro Bowler Kevin Mawae into the team’s Ring of Honor during the Legends Homecoming game presented by Toyota against the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 1st at MetLife Stadium. The induction ceremony, scheduled for halftime, is presented by BankUnited.
Mawae spent eight of his 16 NFL seasons with the Jets, starting all 118 regular season games he played with the Green & White. Additionally, Mawae’s seven NFL playoff appearances all occurred with the Jets, as he started two postseason contests in 1998, 2002 and 2004, and one in 2001.
During his career, Mawae was selected to eight Pro Bowls (1999-2004 with the Jets, 2008-09 with the Titans). Mawae also garnered first-team All-Pro recognition seven times (1999-2002 and 2004 with the Jets, 2007-08 with the Titans) and second-team All-Pro once (1998 with the Jets).
As part of Jets Legends Homecoming weekend, more than 75 alumni are expected to be in attendance, including Ring of Honor members Emerson Boozer, Wayne Chrebet, Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons, Curtis Martin, Don Maynard and Joe Namath. All Legends will be introduced on-field 30 minutes before kickoff.
Following introductions, Namath, Maynard and Martin will take part in a special ceremony. Having already received their Gold Jackets and bronze busts upon their enshrinement, they will receive their Ring of Excellence, created by Kay® Jewelers, in front of Jets fans. The Ring of Excellence is the third symbol of recognition by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
To celebrate Legends Homecoming weekend and the Ring of Honor Ceremony, fans are asked to wear white as part of the Jets Annual Whiteout. The team will take the field in white uniforms and Jets Legends will wear white jerseys. Upon entering MetLife Stadium, all fans will receive a commemorative Mawae white rally towel presented by BankUnited.
In 2010, the team created the Ring of Honor to celebrate Jets greats and commemorate their place in team history. Mawae will become the 18th member of the New York Jets Ring of Honor joining Weeb Ewbank, Winston Hill, Joe Klecko, Curtis Martin, Don Maynard, Joe Namath (2010 Inaugural Class); Larry Grantham, Freeman McNeil, Gerry Philbin, Al Toon (2011); Mark Gastineau, Wesley Walker (2012); Marty Lyons (2013); Wayne Chrebet, Leon Hess (2014); Emerson Boozer, Matt Snell (2015).
BankUnited is a longtime partner of the New York Jets and the “Official Private Banking Sponsor of the New York Jets.”

Spain Catalonia: France snubs independence bid,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Supporters of independence have been urging the EU to intervene
The French government has said it will not recognise Catalonia if it declares independence from Spain and such a move will mean expulsion from the EU.
European Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau said the crisis following the banned 1 October referendum had to be resolved through dialogue within Spain.
Catalan President Carles Puigdemont is expected to address the regional parliament on Tuesday.
There has been no sign of a compromise being struck with Madrid.
Economic pressure on the pro-independence camp is rising with three more companies expected to discuss moving their offices out of Catalonia on Monday, sources told Reuters news agency.

These are infrastructure firm Abertis, telecoms company Cellnex and property group Inmobiliaria Colonial.
Major lenders Caixabank and Sabadell announced earlier that they were moving their offices out of the region.
The region of Catalonia, home to 7.5 million people in the north-east, is crucial to Spain, which is the EU's fifth-biggest economy and a member of Nato.
In other developments:
Catalonia's High Court asked for Spanish national police to provide extra security at the court building in the event of the Catalan parliament declaring independence; the building is currently guarded by local police
The leader of Spain's Socialist opposition party, Pedro Sanchez, told reporters in Barcelona that his party would back government action if independence was declared unilaterally on Tuesday: ""We reach out for dialogue but we'll support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony""
""If there was a declaration of independence, it would not be recognised,"" Ms Loiseau told French broadcaster CNews (video in French).
""The first consequence would be its exit from the European Union.""
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Louiseau has urged dialogue to resolve the Catalan crisis
""Obviously,"" she added, ""there is more to Catalonia than the consultation organised by the independence movement...
""This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics.""
Casting doubt on the validity of the vote, she described Spain as a ""great democracy"" and pointed to the ""particularly"" high level of devolution its regions already enjoyed.
However, Catalans have long been calling for more say in spending, higher status for their language and recognition that they are a nation distinct from Spain.
Could the EU throw out an independent Catalonia?
By Damian Grammaticas, BBC News Europe correspondent
It Catalonia were to split from Spain, the region would immediately cease to be part of the European Union, the EU has made clear.
While EU's treaties don't specify what happens if part of a member state declares independence, EU sources say what's called the ""Prodi doctrine"" would apply.
Named after the former president of the European Commission Romano Prodi, the position is that a region seceding from a member country is automatically no longer part of the EU.
It means that, on the day any Catalan independence took effect, Catalonia would quit the EU; it would lose the right to free movement around Europe for any holders of Catalan passports, and for goods and services too.
Even using the euro as a Catalan currency could prove problematic. And Catalonia could only rejoin the EU by starting a new membership application, as a new country.
But any existing member state could veto this. So Spain, or any other country, could prevent an independent Catalonia's EU membership.
Catalonia's parliament had been due to meet on Monday with the expectation that it would endorse the declaration of independence, based on the majority Yes vote on 1 October.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Speculation has surrounded Mr Puigdemont's next move after large unity demonstrations
However, the session was blocked by the Spanish Constitutional Court, which had likewise sought to stop the referendum itself.
Speculation is intense as to what Mr Puigdemont may say when he addresses the parliament in Barcelona on Tuesday evening.
He could ask the parliament to declare independence on the basis of the referendum law it passed last month, which in turn could lead the Spanish government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to suspend devolution, acting under Article 155 of the constitution.
The BBC understands that whatever Mr Puigdemont says, his statement will trigger the 48-hour period within which MPs need to declare independence, according to the Catalan law.
It is also understood the Catalan leadership has already decided on the way forward.
An MP from Mr Puigdemont's party told the BBC on Sunday that the current plan was to stop short of declaring independence unilaterally and make a ""symbolic statement"" instead.

Final results from the referendum suggest 43% of Catalan voters turned out and 90% of them backed independence - but ""No"" voters largely boycotted the ballot.
At least 350,000 people joined a unionist rally in Barcelona on Sunday, after recent massive rallies by separatists and democracy activists in the city.
The crisis has been largely peaceful, although some 900 civilians and 33 police officers were hurt on referendum day when police sought to stop the vote at some polling stations by force.

Exclusive: Monsanto settles GM cotton dispute with three Indian seed firms,"FILE PHOTO: Monsanto logo is displayed on a screen where the stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on May 9, 2016. To match Special Report MONSANTO-INDIA/ REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Three leading Indian cotton seed makers have settled an intellectual property dispute with Monsanto Co over its genetically modified (GM) seed technology, partly ending a legal tussle that has drawn in the Indian and U.S. governments.
Ajeet Seeds, Kaveri Seed Co Ltd and Ankur Seeds were among six Indian companies that delayed payments to Monsanto, demanding a cut in royalties they paid to the U.S. firm to license its technology.
“The arbitration proceedings with each of these (three) companies have concluded by way of consent orders which record the mutually discussed and accepted settlement terms,” Shilpa Divekar Nirula, CEO of Monsanto India, wrote in a letter to India’s farm minister last month, and seen by Reuters.
A ministry spokesman said he was not aware of the letter.
The dispute sparked a series of government actions that prompted the world's biggest seed company to withdraw from some businesses in India, one of the world's most important seed markets, Reuters revealed in a special report earlier this year. (reut.rs/2ncBknn)
Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) (MMB), a joint venture between Monsanto and local firm Mahyco, licenses a gene that produces its own pesticide to more than 45 local cotton seed companies in lieu of royalties and an upfront payment.
Acting on complaints by some local seed companies that MMB's royalties were too high, the farm ministry last year cut the fees these local firms paid to Missouri-based Monsanto. (reut.rs/2yf4qvA)
Since then, Monsanto - which is being bought by Germany’s Bayer for $66 billion - has been at loggerheads with the seed firms and India’s government over how much it can charge for its GM cotton seeds, costing it tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue a year.
BIGGER PICTURE
Ajeet Seeds and Ankur Seeds told Reuters on Wednesday they had resolved their differences with Monsanto. Calls to Kaveri Seeds’ CEO G.V. Bhaskar Rao were not answered.
“In the larger interest of Indian farmers and agriculture, we have settled our differences with Monsanto,” said M.G. Shembekar, managing director of Ankur Seeds.
“It’s business as usual” with Monsanto now, added Sameer Mulay, managing director of Ajeet Seeds.
Neither disclosed the terms of the resolution.
However, the Sept. 19 letter to Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh said Monsanto has yet to settle with Sri Rama Agri Genetics, Amar Biotech and Nuziveedu Seeds Ltd (NSL), along with two NSL group companies, Prabhat Agri Biotech and Pravardhan Seeds.
“While we remain committed to amicable dialogue with any disputing party, and despite our numerous attempts to arrive at a closure, the outstanding disputes with a few companies ... continue,” Monsanto India’s Nirula wrote.
Monsanto says NSL, based in the southern city of Hyderabad, owes it more than $20 million in royalty payments.
M. Prabhakara Rao, NSL’s chairman and managing director, did not respond to requests seeking comment.
Earlier this year, citing a local law that excludes seeds from being patented, Rao told Reuters that Monsanto should never have been allowed to collect royalties after an initial payment to use its technology. Or, at the very least, he added, prices should have been set by the government.
New Delhi approved the first GM cotton seed trait in 2003 and an upgraded variety in 2006, helping transform India into the world’s top producer and second-largest exporter of the fibre.
“MMB has made several unsuccessful attempts to amicably resolve the bilateral dispute that resulted in such withholding of amounts payable under long-standing agreements,” said a Monsanto India spokesman. “Currently, these matters are pending arbitration in various legal forums.”"
Crossfit Training: The Upperclassman,"Crossfit Training: The Upperclassman
(Before It's News)
You’ve been completing WODs consistently, you’re gradually improving your times, you’re controlling your diet, and you’ve perfected your technique on most if not all of the exercises commonly encountered in CrossFit training.
You probably feel great – in fact, you might feel better than you have in years. You’ve got more energy, more stamina, and more strength, and you probably sleep more soundly than ever.
So, what now? Where can you go from here? It’s time to start thinking about competing.
Preparing for a Competition
Truthfully, nothing can fully prepare you for your first CrossFit competition; it’s something you have to experience to understand. However, it’s important to have a set of guidelines to keep you focused during the event. With so much energy and excitement in the air it’s easy to get sidetracked, and it’s also easy to blow yourself out too early and lose your intensity.
In the days leading up to the event, concentrate on hydrating, maintaining your diet and any supplements you’re using, and continuing to train as hard as you can. Three or four days before the event, pull back a bit on your WODs and concentrate on cardio during your off time. This will give your body a chance to rejuvenate so you can start the competition at peak performance levels.
At the Event
Many first time competitors make three mistakes – they dress wrong, they eat wrong, and they forget to warm up and cool down.
When it comes to dress, use the same clothing you do your WODs in. Don’t try to show off or buy a new outfit just for the event, you’re going to want something functional and familiar.
With all the adrenaline pumping through your system, it’s easy to forget to eat. Your body needs fuel, so set up a series of reminders to tell you when to eat, and don’t skip any meals during the event.
Warming up and cooling down between sessions is critical! Improper warmups increase the chance of injury, and improper cooldowns will overheat you and drain your stamina. Keep your FlexFit mat within reach during the event so you can warmup or cooldown at will.
After the Event
After the event, make sure to keep a record of all your times on all the sessions you participated in. Many first time competitors surprise themselves with how well they do, and you can track your improvements against this record in the months to come. During successive events, try to keep similar records of events you take part in so you can watch your scores improve over time!"
Marseille attacker probably radicalized by brother: police,"Anis Hannachi, the brother of Ahmed Hannachi, a Tunisian man who killed two young women with a knife outside the Marseille train station a week ago, is seen in this handout picture provided by the Italian Police in Rome on this October 9, 2017. Polizia Di Stato/Handout via REUTERS
ROME (Reuters) - The brother of the man who killed two women with a knife outside Marseille train station last week was probably a foreign fighter in Syria and Iraq, Italian investigators said on Monday.
Italian police arrested 25-year-old Tunisian Anis Hannachi in Northern Italy on Saturday evening. He had been in Italy since Oct. 4 or earlier, police said.
His older brother, the 29-year-old Ahmed, was shot dead by a French soldier after killing the two women on Oct. 1.
Ahmed lived south of Rome with his Italian wife from 2008 to 2014, and was known to police only for “petty crimes”, Italy’s chief anti-terrorism prosecutor Franco Roberti told reporters.
“Ahmed never showed any signs of radicalization in Italy,” Roberti said. “The investigative hypothesis we’re working on is that the younger brother radicalized the older one.”
The militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Marseille attack, but did not name Ahmed as the assailant.
Anis has refused to talk to Italian investigators, Roberti said. He was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued by the French, who are investigating the Marseille attack as a “probable” terrorist action.
It is likely that Anis will be extradited to France in a matter of days, Roberti added.
“Anis was flagged as a dangerous individual who probably had been a foreign fighter” in Iraq and Syria, Claudio Galzerano, director of an Italian anti-terrorism police squad, told reporters.
Anis was arrested on suspicion of complicity in his brother’s attack and membership of a terrorist group. He had been fingerprinted and photographed by police in 2014, when he reached Italy by boat and was immediately sent back home.
However, that previous identification meant police were sure they had arrested the right man when they tracked him down on Saturday evening riding a bicycle in the center of Ferrara, in Northern Italy.
He had no identification on him, gave police a false name, and told them he was Algerian, Galzerano said.
Police are now investigating Anis’s possible contacts in Italy.
The Marseille attacker’s estranged wife told Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday that she did not believe Ahmed had become a radical Islamist.
“He didn’t care about religion,” Ramona Cargnelutti told Corriere in an interview. “I’ve never seen him enter a Mosque.”
While admitting she had not seen him for more than two years, she said the murder of the two women was more likely a robbery gone wrong because he was a drug user and always in need of cash.
Roberti said Italian prosecutors will be talking to Cargnelutti in the coming days as part of their investigation.

Restructures for Several Veterans,"Restructures for Several Veterans
(Before It's News)
JEFFERSON AND TUCKER RESTRUCTURE CONTRACTS
On Saturday, Field Yates of EPSN reported that the Ravens had completed contract restructures with Safety Tony Jefferson and PK Justin Tucker. These restructures are the 3rd and 4th time the Ravens have restructured a contract since early August. Jefferson’s and Tucker’s restructures were preceded by CB Jimmy Smith in August and DT Brandon Williams less than 2 weeks ago as the team has dealt with a tight Salary Cap and an ever-growing list of injured players.
Jefferson ($3M) and Tucker ($2.8M) reduced their base salaries down to $775K each and had the balance of their base salaries (15/17th in this case, since the restructure was accomplished after Week 2 of the NFL season) turned into a Signing Bonus. The Signing Bonuses, $1,963,236 for Jefferson and $1,786,764 for Tucker, helped the team create an additional $2,663,603 in much-needed Cap space. Prior to the restructures, the Ravens only had a little over $1.4M in Salary Cap space.
The Ravens’ acute need for Cap space had been brought on by the continuing spate of injuries that have hit the team again this season. The Ravens are currently carrying 81 players on their Cap (53-man roster, 16 on IR, 10 on PS) after only the 3rd week of the season. That number is five more than the next closest team and 10 above the league average for IR’d players. As a comparison, the Ravens ended the 2016 season with “only” 80 players counting against the Cap.
They’ve now already surpassed that.
Jefferson’s restructure will add $490,809 to his Cap numbers in each of the 3 remaining years of his contract (2018-2020) and Tucker’s restructure will add 4595,588 to his Cap numbers in each of the 2 remaining years of his contract (2018-2019).
Taken separately, neither of these restructures are of great impact to the team’s future Cap and neither represents much of a risk of accumulating dead money, since it’s highly likely that both Jefferson and Tucker will finish out their present contracts with the team. However, taken in tandem with each other and with the 2 earlier restructures, the silver lining that was once a much rosier 2018 Cap picture is quickly eroding.
ARRINGTON RECEIVES INJURY PROTECTION BENEFIT
As has been explained in this space since the Spring, former Raven CB Kyle Arrington was entitled to, and would likely claim, the Injury Protection Benefit since he was still unable to be cleared from the concussion protocol after suffering a concussion in training camp last year. This benefit, which only started counting against a team’s Cap in 2016, allows veteran players who are unable to continue to play due to injury to basically receive a reduced amount for the season (or two) after they are released due to a career-ending injury.
This week, as expected, Arrington’s $1.05M Injury Protection Benefit hit the NFLPA’s Salary Cap reports. The team had surely already accounted for this, but the timing of its inclusion by the NFLPA just underscores how tight the team’s Cap had become prior to the recent restructures.
WEBB’S INCENTIVES
Last week, DB Lardarius Webb expressed surprise that he already had 2 interceptions and explained that he was not really expecting to see much playing time when he re-signed with the Ravens in April. At that time, the plan was for Webb to be a back-up Safety, with talented 2nd year CB Tavon Young, manning the slot Cornerback spot. But, injuries to Young and back-up Maurice Canady propelled Webb into the starting slot spot and much more playing time.
In fact, the 2 interceptions have already earned Webb some extra money via incentives and the greatly increased playing time will very likely make him some more. Webb’s new contract called for a modest $900K base salary (basically, the veteran minimum for a player with his time of service), but included up to $1.4M in incentives that could be earned if Webb met various statistical and playing time thresholds. One of those was interceptions, by which Webb would earn up to a maximum of $400K in incentives if he had 2 interceptions ($200K), 3 interceptions ($300K) or 4 or more interceptions ($400K). Webb’s deal also includes $500K worth of incentives for sacks, fumble recoveries, interception return yards, and punt return yards. Lastly, the deal includes $500K worth of incentives that are based on playing time (20%, 30%, 40%, 50%) with team statistical qualifiers. So, if the Ravens D increases its team ranking in either sacks or points allowed and Webb meets the playing time thresholds, Webb will earn the additional incentives.
At this point, through 3 games, Webb has played 70% of the defensive snaps and the Ravens have improved in the 2 team statistical rankings categories, so if the Webb stays healthy and his playing time stays pretty constant, he will earn the full $500K in playing time incentives.
All of these incentives are categorized as Not Likely to Be Earned Incentives (NLTBE) incentives and thus do not count against the 2017 Cap. However, all incentives that are earned by Webb this year will count as a debit against the team’s 2018 Cap. This, of course, will further erode the team’s 2018 Cap space.
PRESENT CAP SPACE
After the restructures, the Ravens are now $4.067M under the Salary Cap. Even with the crazy amount of injuries that have hit the team, that amount should be ample enough to survive the remainder of the season. If the Ravens have any of that left over, they will be able to carry that excess over into 2018.

Joe Biden writing foreword for transgender activist's memoir,"Former Vice President Joe Biden is writing the foreword to a memoir by transgender activist Sarah McBride, who made history when she addressed the Democratic National Convention last year.
McBride is now national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBT-rights organization. Her book, scheduled to be published in March by Crown Archetype, is titled ""Tomorrow Will Be Different: Love, Loss, and the Fight for Trans Equality.""
McBride, 27, first made headlines in 2012 when, at the end of her term as student body president at American University, she came out publicly as transgender in the student newspaper.
She went on to serve as an intern in the White House that year, the first openly transgender woman to do so. After graduating from college, she helped lead a successful effort to pass gender identity nondiscrimination protections in her home state of Delaware.
In 2016, she became the first openly transgender person to speak at one of the major political parties' national conventions.
During her White House internship, McBride met and fell in love with Andrew Cray, a transgender man and fellow activist. Cray was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014 and died just a few days after they married.
In her speech to the Democratic Convention, she evoked her love of Cray.

MacArthur Foundation Names 2017 ‘Genius’ Grant Winners,"“We hope that when people read about the fellows, it makes them think about how they might be more creative in their own lives,” Ms. Conrad said. “It does something for the human spirit.”

The honorees include Nikole Hannah-Jones, 41, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine who writes about the persistence of racial segregation in housing and education. Her work, the foundation wrote, “combines analyses of historical, academic, and policy research with moving personal narratives to bring into sharp relief a problem that many are unwilling to acknowledge still exists.”
The foundation also honored relatively well-known figures in the arts, like the playwright Annie Baker, 36, who won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for “The Flick”; the theater artist Taylor Mac, 44, the creator of the 24-hour piece “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music”; and the writers Jesmyn Ward, 40, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, 46.
The youngest fellow is Cristina Jiménez Moreta, 33, a founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of advocates for immigrant youths. The oldest is Dawoud Bey, 63, a Chicago-based photographer and educator whose portraits of communities include “Harlem Redux” and “The Birmingham Project.”
Even some fellows who have already achieved substantial recognition described the honor as bringing palpable relief.
“I feel released from a profound, decades-old financial anxiety,” Ms. Baker said by email. “Now my job is just to wake up every morning and ask myself: What do I want to write? What is the most important thing I could be writing?”
Few honors are as wrapped in mystery and speculation as the MacArthur. Potential fellows cannot apply but are suggested by a network of hundreds of nominators from across the country, in a range of fields, and winnowed down by an anonymous committee of about a dozen.

When the winners were informed several weeks ago, more than one wondered if it was a prank call. “I’m still in a bit of a haze,” Mr. Mac said. “It’s ridiculous. It’s wonderful. It’s embarrassing. It’s all of it.”

Some fellows described taking winding paths to their current occupation. Gabriel Victora, 40, a Brazilian-born immunologist at Rockefeller University who studies the mechanisms by which antibodies become more effective over time at countering pathogens, came to the United States at 17 to pursue a career as a concert pianist before pivoting to science.
Njideka Akunyili Crosby, 34, a Nigerian-born painter now living in Los Angeles whose work explores transnational identity, studied both biology and art as an undergraduate, and, as the daughter of scientists, had to grow into the idea of art as a potential career. “I think of my studio as a lab sometimes,” she said. “When I’m working out a new idea, I try to be as methodical as I can.”

Jason De Léon, 40, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan, trained as an archaeologist studying ancient sites in Mexico, before shifting focus to clandestine migration across the United States-Mexico border, which he studies using a combination of oral history, archaeological research and forensic science.
“I wear a lot of different hats in my work,” Mr. De Léon said. “Most of my career has been defined by making it up as I go along.”
Other fellows include Yuval Sharon, 37, a Los Angeles-based opera director who has staged works in a train station and a fleet of moving cars; and Trevor Paglen, 43, a conceptual artist and geographer whose work explores invisible aspects of military and corporate power.

While only individuals are eligible for fellowships, some winners spoke of the intensely collaborative nature of their work and of the ways they might use the money and prestige to benefit collaborators, including nonprofessionals.
“I have worked with such amazing people from outside academia,” said Betsy Levy Paluck, 39, a psychologist at Princeton who has studied the ways social norms and social networks influence behavior in settings like American high schools or post-conflict Rwanda. “Some of my best ideas are really theirs.”
Greg Asbed, 54, a founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which seeks to improve conditions in the Florida tomato industry, said the fellowship money would be used to sustain and expand the group’s Fair Food Program, which enlists the purchasing power of large corporations to compel growers to improve working conditions. (Mr. Asbed added that he hoped publicity from his award would help persuade Wendy’s, the only one of the five largest fast-food companies not to join its agreement with tomato growers, to reconsider.)

Mr. Nguyen, who won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for his novel “The Sympathizer,” said he wanted to use some of the money to hire an editor to oversee the blog he created for the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network, as recognition to the broader tradition that made his own success possible.
“I think back to the first Asian-American writers,” he said. “They were really lonely people back then. They deserve this fellowship, too.”
Mr. Nguyen, a professor of English and American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California who has toggled between fiction and scholarship, added that the honor came with something paradoxical: a new opportunity to fail.
“I’ve always been someone who didn’t understand why we had these boundaries between disciplines, but when you try something new it can be humiliating,” he said. “Hopefully that’s something the MacArthur will enable: to continue risking humiliation.”"
Xi propaganda kicks into overdrive ahead of China Communist Party congress,"A man works outside Beijing Exhibition Centre on an exhibition displaying China's achievements for the past five years, as a part of the celebrations of the upcoming 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Beijing, China October 10, 2017.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Inside the packed exhibition hall in central Beijing is a showcase of China’s recent achievements: the country’s first operational aircraft carrier; a gleaming fleet of high-speed trains; happy villagers lifted from poverty.
While the display officially celebrates the accomplishments of the Chinese people over the past five years, it is made clear that President Xi Jinping is the man to thank.
To enter the exhibition, staged by the Communist Party’s propaganda department, visitors pass through a circular antechamber with red walls emblazoned with slogans inspired by Xi’s concepts on governance.
Hundreds of images of Xi adorn the walls in each of the exhibition’s ten halls: in combat fatigues surveying the troops, holding court with foreign dignitaries, even showing his softer side by petting a baby elephant.
By contrast, photographs of other party leaders are much smaller and displayed in less prominent spots.
Even a dinner receipt for 160 yuan ($24.25) bearing Xi’s name is on display, reflecting his frugality.
Alongside radio shows and documentaries lauding Xi’s achievements on state television, the exhibition is part of a propaganda push to bolster the stature of China’s leader ahead of a key Communist Party Congress on Oct 18.
At the conclave, which takes place every five years, Xi is expected to further cement his status as the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.
Although it is typical for the party to sell its key achievements ahead of major events, the propaganda effort is the most effusive for a Chinese leader in years.
Xi is being lionized as the one responsible for China’s recent successes, including an unswerving anti-corruption campaign, a buoyant economy and growing stature on the world stage.
The effort appears designed to justify Xi’s expanded powers, said Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In recent years, Xi has stamped his personal leadership on reforms to the military, economy and cyberspace.
The Communist Party is trying to show that “only a strongman can marshal the forces and pull off these near-miraculous achievements which he is supposed to have achieved in the past five years,” Lam said.
The State Council Information Office, which also acts as the party spokesman’s office, did not respond to request for comment.
CULT OF PERSONALITY?
Chinese leaders do not make explicit appeals to the public for support, as, in theory, the Party confers the power of the people onto the leadership.

In reality, the images of top leaders are carefully cultivated by the Party’s propaganda arm.
An avuncular image of Xi during his early years in office, which led to a folksy nickname - “Xi Dada”, or “Uncle Xi” - and syrupy songs about his looks, was stamped out in early 2016 to avoid creating a cult of personality.
Kitschy souvenirs, like mugs and plates with images of Xi and his wife, the famous singer Peng Liyuan, have become harder to find.
Censorship of images that mock Xi, including an internet meme that plays on his supposed likeness to Winnie the Pooh, the cartoon character, has also tightened in recent months.
Still, personal touches have not completely disappeared from Xi’s carefully crafted public image.
Slideshow (10 Images)
On Sept 1, the 30-year anniversary of Xi and Peng’s marriage, a WeChat account posted an article of old photos and personal details about the couple.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said the account was run by an official reporter who travels with Peng whenever she accompanies Xi overseas and is designed to share select details of the first couple’s life together.
DIGGING WELLS, TRANSCENDING THE WEST
For the most part, the latest wave of propaganda casts Xi as all business, focusing on his dedication, his aptitude and his personal role in guiding China into a new stage of development.
One documentary on state television applauded Xi’s prowess on the global stage. Foreign Minister Wang Yi published an essay in an official newspaper saying his contributions to diplomacy had transcended 300 years of western theory on foreign affairs.
A popular section of the Beijing exhibition is devoted to Xi’s pledge to transform China’s military into a world-class fighting force, including a display of model missile launchers, battleships and the Liaoning aircraft carrier, all under a giant red flag.
“It’s inspiring,” said one visitor, a retired automation engineer who only wanted to be identified by his surname, Ma. “The speed of China’s development has been very quick, and the ordinary people have benefited.”
A book on Xi, a 452-page collection of interviews of his years in rural Shaanxi province during the Cultural Revolution, has also been heavily promoted in recent months.
Some of the anecdotes are reminiscent of Party mythology about heroes who selflessly work for others - such as Lei Feng, an idealized soldier of the Mao Zedong era who was upheld as a model citizen after his death.
In the book, villagers who knew him say Xi showed signs of greatness even then, describing in one anecdote how he led villagers to dig a well so they had access to drinking water.
“It was icy cold to the bone but Jinping was down the well, his legs deep in the mud,” one villager, Liang Yuming, said. “He’d work for a long time, until he really couldn’t take it any more.”"
"Trump continues NBC threats, says 'licenses must be challenged'","President Trump started and ended his day Wednesday by lashing out at NBC and other American television networks. He explicitly threatened the press by saying on Twitter that ""network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked.""
It was a follow-up to the morning missive that reflected his fury over an NBC News report that said he wanted a tenfold increase in the United States' nuclear arsenal. He decried ""fake news coming out of NBC and the Networks"" and asked ""At what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!""
So the president is asserting that media companies which report aggressively about his administration should be punished by having their television station licenses scrutinized and possibly revoked.
In between those two tweets, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he found it ""frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write.""
Freedom of the press is a core principle of the U.S. Constitution.
When a reporter followed up and asked whether he believed there ""should be limits on what the press should write,"" Trump said, ""No. The press should speak more honestly.""
Still, his comment raised eyebrows, especially because it was the latest remark in a string of heightened ""fake news"" attacks Trump has leveled against the press in recent days.
Trump's new comments were condemned by press freedom organizations and some former government officials.
But his threat about TV licenses is essentially toothless.
First of all, there is no single license for NBC or any other national television network. Licenses are granted to individual local stations -- and NBC doesn't even own most of the stations that broadcast its content across the country. And it is extremely unusual for any station's license to be taken away for any reason, much less for a political vendetta.
The licenses for local television stations are subject to review by the Federal Communications Commission every eight years.
It would not be possible for Trump or his allies to challenge all of the licenses held by NBC in one fell swoop. Residents would have to submit complaints about individual stations to the FCC on a market-by-market basis.
The president seems to be encouraging that with his Wednesday night tweet.
There is precedent for political allies of a president challenging local licenses. It happened under Richard Nixon in the 1970s, when a friend of Nixon's tried to take over a license held by the Washington Post. Nixon's ally did not succeed in his bid.
Short of gross misconduct on the part of a challenged station, it's unlikely any other such attempt now would be successful either.
""Whatever other legal problems [NBC parent] Comcast may have, this is not one of them,"" Andrew Jay Schwartzman, an attorney who works at the Georgetown University Law Center and specializes in telecommunications law, told CNN. ""Comcast knows full well that the FCC will never, ever, deny its license renewal applications.""
The FCC is technically an independent body, not subject to the president's orders. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai -- who is a Republican appointed to his current post by Trump -- said in March that his job is not to be a ""political actor.""
""It is simply to be somebody at the FCC who, as I said, is administering the laws of the United States,"" Pai said. ""I'm simply not going to wade into that kind of political debate.""
Neither Pai nor an FCC spokesperson immediately responded to requests for comment about Trump's tweet. But former FCC officials were quick to skewer the president.
""To me it's just incomprehensible that because of the content of NBC News that somehow their license would be at risk,"" Alfred Sykes, a Republican who served as chairman of the FCC under George H.W. Bush, told The Wrap.
""This madcap threat, if pursued, would be blatant and unacceptable intervention in the decisions of an independent agency,"" echoed Michael Copps, a Democrat who served as FCC commissioner under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, in a statement to HuffPost. ""The law does not countenance such interference. President Trump might be happier as emperor, but I think the American people would strip him of his clothes on this issue.""
A spokesperson for NBC declined to comment.
Trump has increased his attacks on the media in the past week. Last week, he urged the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate news outlets for publishing supposed ""fake"" stories. Over the weekend, he hinted it was perhaps time for a law that would require broadcasters to give equal time to both sides of the political debate when discussing public policy.
""At what point are we going to silence media critical of the President?"" tweeted Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. ""When we cease to have a First Amendment and a democratic government."""
Che Guevara’s Fiery Life and Bloody Death,"“The orders to his troops were simple,” the article said. “‘Go in and attack!’”

As the rebels consolidated control, a reporter asked Guevara what he planned to do now. “We are waiting for Fidel,” he said.

In the months and years that followed, Guevara oversaw executions at La Cabaña prison before becoming a top-level economic minister and diplomat, traveling the world to promote Cuba’s ideals.
Departure and Death
In October 1965, Fidel Castro confirmed the growing speculation: Guevara, an increasingly mysterious figure, had left Cuba. Castro read aloud a letter he said he had received from Guevara that said: “I feel I have completed the duty which the Cuban revolution gave me. I say farewell to you.”
He added, “Other nations require my services and I must leave you.”

Those nations included Congo, where a six-month revolutionary effort failed, and then Bolivia, where he found himself on the run from the country’s army, which was aided by the C.I.A.
After Guevara was captured and summarily killed, it took several days for something close to the truth to emerge. The Bolivian Army initially announced that he had died in a clash and that he had “admitted that he failed in the seven-month guerrilla campaign he organized in Bolivia,” an article on The Times’s front page said.
The next day, the nature of his death became clearer: “A medical report indicated today that Ernesto Che Guevara was slain at least 24 hours after his capture in the southeastern jungle on Sunday,” The Times reported.

Still shrouded in mystery, however, was the location of his body, which was buried secretly in a mass grave. (His hands were cut off and preserved in formaldehyde to prove his identity.)
A Second Burial
It was not until nearly 30 years later that Jon Lee Anderson, who was writing a biography of Guevara, learned of the location, and the revolutionary was given a second burial with full honors in Cuba.
Photo
On that occasion, in October 1997, Fidel Castro described him as “the paradigm of the revolutionary” who is “everywhere there is a just cause to defend,” The Times reported.
Raúl Barroso González, a retiree, spoke for many who admired Guevara. “As far as we are concerned, he is still alive,” he said."

"10 Important Stories From 09/28/17 Box Scores: Is Pham For Real, The Outlook For E. Rodriguez & More","10 Important Stories From 09/28/17 Box Scores: Is Pham For Real, The Outlook For E. Rodriguez & More
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
It was a dominant performance from Carlos Carrasco, who tossed 8.1 shutout innings allowing 6 H and 1 BB while striking out 14 (and only needing 112 pitches to get there). Carlos Correa filled the box score, going 4-4 with 1 HR, 3 RBI and 3 R (finishing a triple short of the cycle). Giancarlo Stanton is making his push for 60 HR, going 3-4 with 2 HR, 3 RBI and 3 R. What else happened on the field that we need to know about? Let’s take a look:
1) Is Jason Kipnis rediscovering himself…
It’s basically been a lost season for Kipnis, who is hitting .232 with 12 HR and has missed significant time due to injury. He did get the Indians going yesterday though, going 1-4 with 1 HR, 2 RBI and 1 R, and now has hits in five of his past six games (7-20 with 1 HR, 5 RBI and 2 R). It’s promising, and there’s obviously reason to believe that he would improve upon his .258 BABIP if he had the time (.315 for his career). He also has continued to show an ability to make more than enough contact, with a 19.6% strikeout rate. Maybe he doesn’t bring the stolen base potential that he once did, but he appears primed to be a solid bounce back candidate heading into 2018.
2) Does Jacob Faria hold future appeal…
He clearly didn’t pitch much as he’s worked his way back, throwing a total of 8.0 innings in his three September appearances. He didn’t end on a high note, allowing 3 R (2 earned) on 4 H and 2 BB, striking out 2, over 3.0 IP against the Yankees. The problem was 2 HR allowed, and that’s the big red flag hanging over him. He generated 2 groundballs vs. 4 fly balls last night, after entering the day with a 38.7% groundball rate. He had a 1.07 HR/9 at Triple-A prior to his recall, and as his number in the Majors rises (as well as a regression in his .266 BABIP and 78.1% strand rate entering the day) the value will plummet. He’s usable and a backend option entering ’18, but don’t make the mistake of valuing him more than that.
3) Tyler Glasnow walks the ballpark…
The Pirates split the game, with Ivan Nova taking the first 2.0 IP and then handing the ball off to Glasnow. No one is going to question the upside of the once top prospect, but there are obviously significant issues. He went 3.2 innings allowing 1 R on 2 H and 5 BB, striking out 2, and has now walked 15 batters over his past 7.2 IP. In 62.0 innings in the Majors this season he owns a 6.39 BB/9, and while it looked like he turned a corner at Triple-A (3.09 BB/9) we can’t ignore his 5.04 BB/9 in 110.2 IP at Triple-A last season (and 5.01 in 23.1 IP in the Majors). Until he can consistently throw strikes he’s simply not going to be a trusted option, and as we head into 2018 he’s a high upside flier and nothing more.
4) A disastrous finish for Eduardo Rodriguez…
Taking on the Astros he allowed 5 ER on 6 H and 2 BB, striking out 2, over 1.2 IP. He had been stringing together a few good starts, but at the end of the day he ends the year allowing 5 ER in three of his final seven starts and the owner of a 4.19 ERA and 1.28 WHIP. No one is going to question his ability to generate strikeouts and his control is solid, but home runs are an issue (1.25 HR/9, courtesy of a 34.9% groundball rate). With nothing unbelievable about his luck metrics (.299 BABIP, 74.5% strand rate) it’s fair to say that this simply is what he is. That has value, but don’t view him as anything different.
5) An appropriately poor finish for Julio Teheran…
Taking on the Marlins Teheran allowed 5 ER on 8 H and 3 BB, striking out 3, over 6.0 IP to finish the disappointing year with a 4.49 ERA and 1.35 WHIP. We all know that the biggest issue this season has been home runs (1.48 HR/9), but that’s not the sole reason for his struggles. He simply wasn’t getting as many swings and misses as usual (9.4% SwStr%) and his pinpoint control wasn’t there (3.44 BB/9). There’s going to likely be reason to believe in a rebound in 2018, though it’s hardly a given. He’ll be a pitcher we take an extremely close look at in the offseason before drawing any definitive conclusion.
6) The value of Tommy Pham continues to grow…
He went 2-4 with 1 R and 2 SB yesterday, putting him at .311 with 23 HR, 73 RBI, 93 R and 25 SB in what can only be described as a highly impressive performance. Can we expect him to even reasonably come close to those numbers again, though? The two red flags are his .373 BABIP and 26.7% HR/FB, both of which can easily regress. That said he’s shown the potential to be a 20/20 player and also has impressive plate discipline (7.5% SwStr%, 19.1% O-Swing%). Maybe he does take a step back, but he’s proven that he’s going to hold value moving forward.
7) A strong finish from Sean Manaea…
It came against the Rangers, which at this point is a favorable matchup for any pitcher, but he still allowed just 1 R (0 earned) on 3 H and 3 BB, striking out 6, over 6.2 IP to finish the year at 12-10 with a 4.37 ERA and 1.40 WHIP. Obviously the overall numbers aren’t impressive, though part of his issues were tied to poor luck (.318 BABIP, 69.6% strand rate). He offers more upside in the strikeout department, given his 11.3% SwStr%, and things really went off the track in the second half (.350 BABIP, 67.7% strand rate, 6.47 K/9). Pitching in Oakland with the skills he brings, he’ll once again carry breakout potential heading into 2018 and could be an ideal post-hype sleeper.
8) Things going south for Yoan Moncada…
He was impressing for a while, but things have unsurprisingly taken a bit of a turn in recent days. Last night he went 0-3 with 2 K, and over his past seven games he’s gone 5-30 with 13 K. Overall in September he’s struck out 29 times in 87 AB and owns a 33.3% strikeout rate over 219 PA in the Majors. He brings power and speed, but until he figures out how to make consistent contact (12.7% SwStr%) the total value just isn’t going to be there. It doesn’t mean that he should be written off, but with high expectations you are going to have to proceed with caution next season.
9) Nick Castellanos continues to finish strong…
He went 2-4 with 3 RBI yesterday, putting him at .377 with 6 HR and 23 RBI in September alone. Overall he’s hitting an impressive .274 with 25 HR (as well as 6 doubles and 10 triples) with 99 RBI as he appears to be figuring things out. He’s maintained his ability to hit the ball hard (24.7% line drive rate) and he’s proven that last year’s power breakout is for real (13.7% and 14.0% HR/FB the past two seasons). He could still use some improvement in his plate discipline, with a 13.3% SwStr% and 34.9% O-Swing%, but at 26-years old next season he could have another career year ahead of him.
10) Danny Duffy goes out with a whisper…
Taking on the Tigers he allowed 4 ER on 6 H and 3 BB, striking out 4, over 4.1 IP to finish the year with a 3.81 ERA and 1.26 WHIP. Over his final two outings he managed just 6 K vs. 5 BB over 10.1 IP, though that shouldn’t take away from his overall strong showing in ’17 (8.00 K/9, 2.52 BB/9). The obvious red flag is his 39.5% groundball rate and 0.80 HR/9, but improvements in his .309 BABIP and 71.3% strand rate would help to offset any home run regression. He may not be an ace, but he does have that upside and should be a Top 40 starter heading into ’18.

Successful Career Women Finish the Phrase ‘If Only …’,"Photo
The New York Times asked some of the participants at last week’s global meeting of the Women’s Forum for the Economy and Society in Paris to look both backward and forward — backward at what they would have changed as they climbed up the career ladder and forward to what needs to change to create greater gender equity. The Times was a media partner in the event. Some of the answers have been condensed and edited.

In my 30s, I went through a period of being a complete workaholic. Other women didn’t want to work for me because they didn’t want that lifestyle. I eventually realized that being a workaholic was a choice, not a necessity, and the best way to manage is to surround yourself with the best people you can find and empower them. Don’t make the mistake of viewing good people as a threat.

I would have focused on building relationships and expanding my networks, both within the organization and outside of it, much earlier in my career. I would have put as much effort into cultivating these relationships as I did trying to do my job really well. Women can often find themselves excluded from so many natural networks, so it’s important to make a conscious effort to build these relationships early, in addition to doing your job well. Catching up on these two things later in your career is very challenging.

I would have taken more time off for vacations. I was always afraid “there was too much to do” for a two-or-three-week vacation, so I carried over time every year, throughout my entire career. When I recently left my position and cashed out the unused vacation time, the money seemed minuscule in comparison to the adventures I missed.

We need to shore up our laws, whether strengthening existing laws like those governing sexual harassment and other types of workplace discrimination, or adopting new legislation, such as the Paycheck Fairness Act. We also need to see corporate leadership step up. Finally, we need to engage individuals, and this includes men. I personally have been lucky where some of my best, most invested bosses and mentors have been male allies who “get it.” We need to be proactive in cultivating that sort of sensibility within men.

"Marty Baron cuts through Trump noise, stays focused on Washington Post's mission","Marty Baron has learned to tune out President Trump's insults against the press.
""It's almost become like background music to the work that we do every day,"" the Washington Post's executive editor told Brian Stelter this week in a rare TV interview.
But Baron still takes Trump's comments seriously. ""The administration's continuing attack on the press and its effort to undermine our credibility"" is a real danger to newsrooms like the Post, he said.
Trump's moniker for the Post is the ""Amazon Washington Post.""
""It's an absurd thing to say,"" Baron said.""I mean, the fact is we're not owned by Amazon. We're owned by Jeff Bezos, who's the founder of Amazon and he doesn't get involved in our coverage in any way.""
Highlights from the interview with Baron, taped at the Washington Post's headquarters, will air Sunday on Reliable Sources, but you can listen to the full conversation as a podcast here:
Baron, one of the most respected editors in the industry, has led the Boston Globe and the Washington Post to multiple Pulitzer Prizes. His work at the Boston Globe was famously depicted in the Oscar-winning film ""Spotlight"" in 2015.
When he's not contending with President Trump's attacks against the press, Baron is working to prevent a rollback of policies that limit the exposure of reporters in leak investigations by the Department of Justice.
""We would like to see the existing policy maintained,"" said Baron, who attended a meeting this week with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and representatives of the news media on this subject.
Under the guidelines that the Trump administration is looking to revise, Baron explained, if the government wanted to obtain a search warrant, or subpoena records ""from third parties, like telephone companies and internet providers"" in the context of a leak investigation, ""we would receive notification.""
The current guidelines were enacted in 2015, after the Obama administration came under fire for obtaining phone records and email communications from the Associated Press and Fox News, a move many interpreted as an overreach.
Baron reminded Stelter that the relationship between the press and the Obama administration was all but ""warm and cozy.""
""They had more leak investigations involving the press than all previous administrations combined,"" Baron said.
However, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in August that the Trump administration is pursuing a number of leak investigations three times higher than what was left open at the end of Obama's tenure, Baron said he thinks ""that is, in fact, an effort to try to intimidate the press from doing its job.""
It's possible that some Post reporters are ensnared in leak investigations right now, he acknowledged, but the Post wouldn't know it unless there was a subpoena, a search warrant or ""an actual leak about the leak investigation.""
In the interview, Baron said the Trump administration has created ""a very hostile atmosphere"" with the news media.
""The administration has restricted access to certain kinds of information,"" he said, citing the president's tax returns, White House's visitor logs, and various data sets from government agencies.
He indicated that he is troubled by the lack of transparency on several different fronts.
""Things could be better. Let's put it that way,"" he said.
But Baron is not daunted by these obstacles. When asked if the Justice Department's pursuit of leakers sends a ""chilling effect"" through the Post's newsroom, Baron did not hesitate in his response.
""It doesn't have a chilling effect on us right now,"" he said. ""That's for sure, and I don't expect that it will, because we understand what our mission is and we intend to pursue it no matter what.""
The Post recently celebrated a business-side milestone -- one million digital subscribers.
What's the next goal? ""Two million,"" he quipped.
Asked whether the growth is attributable to interest in the Trump presidency, as some analysts have asserted, Baron said ""I can't say that it's totally disconnected,"" but ""I think it's much broader than that.""
People have come to value ""quality journalism,"" he said. ""They want to support quality journalism. They're concerned about the spread of conspiracy theories. They're concern about the spread of falsehoods. They're concerned about that. They've come to value the role of quality news organizations and they want they want to support that. They think it's important and they think that it's essential to a well-functioning democracy and to civil society. And: they're right about that."""

Broncos President of Football Ops/GM John Elway has spoken some pretty strong words after a weekend full of protests around the NFL after the words of President Donald Trump last Friday.
A number of teams and players did things like lock arms, take knees, and even stay in the locker room instead of standing like normal for the anthem.
Elway stated that he ‘believes’ in standing for the anthem, and that the United States in the greatest country in the world. He went on in his statement to say that he knows ‘that there are a lot of things that need to be corrected,’ but went on to say that he hopes the players can get back more to focusing on playing.

"Soccer: From ridiculous to sublime, Tite turns Brazil around","FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - World Cup 2018 Qualifiers - news conference - Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) headquarters, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, September 15, 2017. Brazilian national team head coach Tite attends a news conference to announce his team's squad which will play against Bolivia and Chile. REUTERS/Sergio Moraes
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Little more than a year has gone by since Tite took over as coach of a Brazil side still reeling from embarrassing exits in the World Cup and Copa America but in that short time he has transformed the team into favorites for Russia 2018.
No one could have imagined just how influential the former Corinthians coach would be but nine wins in 10 World Cup qualifiers are just reward for a return to the form that won them a record five World Cup titles.
“There is no questioning the enormous quality of Brazil’s players, Tite and backroom staff,” the normally cautious former World Cup winner Tostao wrote before the final two qualifiers against Bolivia and Chile. “The team is ready.”
Tite retained several players who had misfired under Luiz Felipe Scolari during the 2014 World Cup and his successor Dunga but he transformed their front line with the introduction of attack-minded youngsters Philippe Coutinho and Gabriel Jesus.
In midfield he recalled Paulinho and Renato Augusto, his former charges at Corinthians.
With Real Madrid’s Casemiro an automatic choice to anchor the team and Neymar still the undisputed talisman, the side is settled and there are no major disagreements over the first 11 for the first time in years.
Tite’s task between now and next June is mostly deciding who will support those leading men.
The problem, if there is one, comes with Brazil’s almost customary over-confidence. They are the only side to play in every World Cup and even after their 7-1 hammering by Germany in the 2014 semi-finals on home soil, they believe they are special.
Just as in 2006, when Brazil sailed through the qualifiers with players like Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho and Adriano, they go to Russia as one of the clear favorites.
But Brazil were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by France and over confidence was one of the reasons cited.
Tite is a master of playing down expectations and - crucially in a nation that famously has 200 million coaches – he commands the respect of both players and press.
That has given him an authority that few Brazil managers this century have enjoyed and he has used it to warn their outstanding form is no guarantee of success.
“We are at a stage of strengthening, consolidating and growing,” he said when announcing his squad for this week’s games.
“We’re not in the comfort zone stage but rather a confidence zone stage.”

Passing Game Film Review - McFrown - Week 4 (Jaguars),"Passing Game Film Review – McFrown – Week 4 (Jaguars)
(Before It's News)
The Jets won the game, but it wasn’t pretty. The Jaguars had plenty of opportunities to win the game, but Blake Bortles is a terrible QB, and the Jaguars have to be in the market for a good QB soon. Let’s look at some of the bad plays in the passing game.
1)
This play is a one outcome play, as the Jets have one route in mind and the rest of the team is tasked with blocking at first. The main purpose is to get the ball to Robby Anderson running down the field, and he is open for the pass. However, McCown doesn’t take the risk with the throw, instead choosing to run around the pocket until finding a safer option, which leads to a pass that nets negative yardage. This is probably one of the biggest issues with McCown, as he’s risk averse to a fault and doesn’t push the ball down the field when opportunities are present. The Jets caught the Jaguars in a bad defense for this deep route, yet still end up losing yards on this play.
2)
This is a third down pass that does not get a first down, because McCown makes the throw too early. The read on this play is the middle linebacker, especially since McCown has space inside the pocket to wait. When the tight end runs by the linebacker, that’s when the throw needs to be made, depending on the reaction of the linebacker. If the linebacker moves up for the running back, then the pass goes to an open tight end. If the linebacker follows the tight end backwards, there is more space for Kerley to run up the field. Instead, McCown pulls the trigger early, which allows the defense to collapse upon Kerley to prevent yards after the catch like a punt return.
3)
This play doesn’t count because there is a holding penalty on the Jets offensive line. However, note the risk aversion again from McCown. He has a wide open receiver running down the field and should be able to hit him for a sizable gain. However, McCown doesn’t pull the trigger and ends up running with the ball. This should have been a completed pass down the field. To hurt the cause more, the penalty happens after McCown decides to run, as the offensive lineman is trying to prevent the defensive lineman from running after McCown. Therefore, had he chosen to make the pass to the open receiver, the penalty would not have been called. This is a brutal miss by the Jets.
4)
The Jets are trying to rush down the field prior to the half to get some points, so some risk is warranted. However, McCown once again has a receiver running free down the field, and he decides to pass up on the option to get sacked. This should be an easy completion as soon as the receiver clears the linebacker in the middle, as you can see with him looking back towards the QB, expecting a pass. Another major missed opportunity by the Jets.
5)
The Jets are near the goal line and trying to score a TD, and McCown once again misses a wide open receiver. He makes a throw to a covered Jermaine Kearse, with Robby Anderson running free down the middle of the field. This is essentially a Fitzpatrick level pass because McCown focused in on Kearse from the start of the play and didn’t see Anderson at all. This could have been a touch down.
6)
This is a second and five play, and it almost goes for a pick six interception. The Jets have two safety options built into the route on either end to make easy completions. McCown does a good job of scanning the field, and finds Anderson open for the pass, but he can’t throw the ball with enough force and it’s almost intercepted. He doesn’t seem to see the safety in the middle at all, and it almost costs him. The decision is fine on this play, but he has to put more force behind this throw, or take the safety valve options because this is a fairly easy interception opportunity for the safety.
7)
On the outset, this is an unlucky interception. The pass most likely wouldn’t be intercepted if Bilal Powell doesn’t fall down. However, given the relatively clean pocket, this is another throw that is executed far too early. The Jets have a receiver cutting across the middle and Powell is the second tier option on the play. If the middle linebacker cuts towards Powell, then the receiver cutting across is open. If the middle linebacker goes with the receiver, then Powell will be building momentum with more space to run. Instead, McCown throws this pass early, which allows the middle linebacker to run towards the pass early, thus increasing the chance of Powell being stopped prior to the first down anyway. Since Powell falls down anyway, it’s a moot point, but this is also very bad execution on the part of McCown.
8)
Another Fitzpatrick level stare down of Jermaine Kearse, which almost leads to an interception.
9)
The Jets have a receiver going right down the field to the right side of the formation, with a defender trying to gain inside leverage, thus meaning a free release to the outside. Instead of taking a shot with the pass, McCown throws this pass up into double coverage to the other side of the field, with another pass that is lucky not to be intercepted. There isn’t much to be said about this, it’s just a bad decision.
10)
This is a play that has been analyzed over and over again. It’s pretty simple, McCown threw the pass early, which meant that Powell wasn’t ready for this pass, and it bounces away from him. The pass is a lateral, thus it counts as a fumble and it gets returned for a touchdown. The Jets are set up well to get some yards on this play with the screen pass, but McCown rushing it throws the entire play off.
Bonus:
1)
The play ends up being positive, but it seems like a very risky play with a low chance of a positive outcome. The game is tied, and the situation is 4th and 21, with 22 seconds remaining in the first half. The Jets need to execute a pass from a punter for 21 yards to have a chance for a possibly long field goal. An incomplete pass in this scenario would give good field position to the Jaguars with roughly 16 seconds remaining for a couple of quick plays. The throw is wobbly, and Marcus Williams makes a nice catch, runs around the defender, then runs into his own player, and somehow regains momentum to get the first down. The Jets of course seemed ill prepared for a positive outcome, as they promptly get a delay of game penalty and then miss the field goal. Most Jets fans probably don’t mind this call since the team is playing with house money, but this is a bad call for the situation. If there was more time to sustain a drive, or at least a couple of shots into the end zone, then it’s worth it. It worked out for the Jets but the distance and situation called for a safe punt.
Conclusion:
Josh McCown hadn’t won back to back games since 2004, a feat he accomplished with this win. Things that happened in 2004:
Britney Spears married Kevin Federline
The infamous Janet Jackson incident at the Super Bowl
FaceBook is launched
The last season of Friends
President Bush is re-elected
The Christmas tsunami
The Jets offensive system is actually encouraging because receivers are getting open, but the QB is missing them on a routine basis. McCown has a high completion percentage, mainly because he’s overly conservative with passes in critical situations.
Grade: C
If the Jets had faced a competent offense, this would have been a loss.
Forum Question(s):
A) What’s your opinion on the punt?
You can discuss this with other NY Jets fans on the Jet Nation message board. Or visit of on Facebook.

"Drained of cash and riven by rivalries, UNESCO seeks leader to revive fortunes","A view shows the headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris, France, October 4, 2017. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer
PARIS (Reuters) - When Israel’s envoy told UNESCO delegates last July that fixing the plumbing in his toilet was more important than their latest ruling, it highlighted how fractious geopolitics are paralyzing the workings of the agency.
Whoever wins the race to replace Irina Bokova as head of the U.N.’s cultural and education body next week will have to try to restore the relevance of an agency born from the ashes of World War Two but increasingly hobbled by regional rivalries and a lack of money.
Its triumphs include designating world heritage sites such as the Galapagos Islands and the historic tombs of Timbuktu -- re-built by UNESCO after Islamist militants destroyed them.
But in a sign of how toxic relations have become, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly last month that UNESCO was promoting “fake history”.
Like Israel’s plain-speaking envoy Carmel Shama Hacohen, Netanyahu was referring to UNESCO’s designation of Hebron and the two adjoined shrines at its heart - the Jewish Tomb of the Patriarchs and the Muslim Ibrahimi Mosque - as a “Palestinian World Heritage Site in Danger.”
Jews believe the Cave of the Patriarchs is where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives, are buried. Muslims, who, like Christians, also revere Abraham, built the Ibrahimi mosque, also known as the Sanctuary of Abraham, in the 14th century.
Israeli-Palestinian hostilities, though, are only part of a minefield of contentious issues on which the U.N. body has to hand down rulings.
Japan, for example, threatened to withhold its 2016 dues after UNESCO included documents submitted by China on the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in its “Memory of the World” program.
The Paris-based organization, which also promotes global education and supports press freedom, convenes its executive council on Oct. 9 to begin voting on seven candidates.
Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, France, Lebanon, Qatar and Vietnam have put forward candidates. There is no clear frontrunner.

UNESCO’s struggles worsened in 2011, when the United States canceled its substantial budgetary contribution in protest at a decision to grant the Palestinians full membership. UNESCO has been forced to cut programs and freeze hiring.
“It’s an organization that has been swept away from its mandate to become a sounding board for clashes that happen elsewhere, and that translates into political and financial hijacking,” said a former European UNESCO ambassador.

All the candidates have vowed a grassroots overhaul and pledged independence from their home nations.
France and China, both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, argue the agency needs ”strong leadership, which can only come with the backing of a major power.
Chinese candidate Qian Tang has almost 25 years experience at UNESCO. His bid fits into Beijing’s soft power diplomacy, though Western capitals fret about China controlling an agency that shapes internet and media policy.
Former French culture minister Audrey Azoulay carries the support of France’s new young president, Emmanuel Macron. But the last minute French candidacy has drawn the ire of Arab states, notably Egypt, who believe it should be their turn.
The Arab states face their own political tests. Their three entries underscore their own disunity, something the Egyptian hopeful Moushira Khattab has indicated stymie the Arab bid.
The crisis engulfing Qatar and its Gulf Arab neighbors, who have called Doha a “high level” sponsor of terrorism, meanwhile may have hurt the chances of former Qatari culture minister Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari.

"10 Important Stories From 10/01/17 Box Scores: Snell Dominates, Gonzalez Stumbles & More","10 Important Stories From 10/01/17 Box Scores: Snell Dominates, Gonzalez Stumbles & More
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
With many teams putting up their B or C lineups, the biggest stories came from the mound yesterday (as we’d expect on the final day of the season). There were a few hitters who had some noteworthy days, but for the most part the spotlight belongs on the Blake Snell’s and James Paxton’s, who stole the show. Let’s take a look at their performances and all the rest from yesterday’s action:
1) A dominant Blake Snell steals the night…
He faced off against a lifeless Orioles team, tossing 7.0 shutout innings allowing 2 H and 0 BB. That wasn’t the most impressive number, though, as he racked up 13 K thanks to 24 swinging strikes. No one has ever questioned his strikeout stuff, the problem has always been his control. Obviously this type of performance has been the exception, not the rule, as he posted a 5.16 BB/9 in 89.0 IP in the Majors last season and a 4.34 BB/9 over 122.1 IP entering the day. The upside is there, and while replicating this performance is going to be nearly impossible it does go to show the type of upside that he has.
2) Jordan Montgomery finishes strong…
Taking on the Blue Jays he allowed 1 ER on 2 H and 1 BB, striking out 3, over 5.1 IP though he ultimately settled for a no decision. You could argue that he deserved a bigger role, as opposed to being bumped from the rotation, but he made his mark and should be locked into the rotation come ’18. He finished with 155.1 IP in the Majors, pitching to a 3.88 ERA and 1.23 WHIP. He entered the day with an 8.46 K/9 (courtesy of a 12.3% SwStr%) and 3.00 BB/9, and he also showed enough groundball potential in the first half (43.1%). While he may never be an ace, pitching in the AL East, he’s going to hold value.
3) Is Daniel Mengden an ace in the making…
He certainly pitched as such in September, and he put a nice cap on it yesterday tossing 7.0 shutout innings allowing 4 H and 1 BB, striking out 8, against the Texas Rangers. Since returning on September 9 he allowed 6 ER on 23 H and 6 BB, striking out 26, over 35.0 IP including three scoreless appearances. While he’s not likely quite that good, he’s shown solid strikeout rates and control (he entered the day with a 7.67 K/9 and 3.42 BB/9 over 109.0 IP in the Majors, with even more upside than that). He also has the potential to generate enough groundballs, especially pitching half his games in Oakland. He may not be an ace, but he should be a solid mid-level option.
4) Gio Gonzalez stumbles to the finish…
At the end of the day no one is going to complain about a 2.96 ERA and 1.18 WHIP, but it was a lackluster finish to the season (though that shouldn’t be a surprise). He allowed 6 ER on 7 H and 3 BB, striking out 2, over 4.1 IP yesterday and finished allowing 5 ER or more in three of his last six starts. He entered the day with an 83.5% strand rate and .252 BABIP, so while it was a solid season overall there’s little chance that he replicates it. We will dig in a lot deeper over the offseason, but don’t make the mistake of paying for this year’s success.
5) Nick Williams finishes with a bang…
Taking on the Mets he went 2-4 with 1 HR, 3 RBI and 2 R, ending his rookie year hitting .288 with 12 HR and 55 RBI over 313 AB. Of course he also entered the day with a 28.4% strikeout rate, courtesy of some awful plate discipline (18.8% SwStr%, 44.5% O-Swing%) and a fly ball rate that may not be able to maintain this type of power (27.2%). There’s clearly a lot of upside, but he also needs to make some adjustments before the league adjusts to him. Time will tell if he’s able to or not, but be cautious before investing too heavily in him for 2018.
6) There’s no questioning James Paxton’s upside…
He simply needs to stay healthy and he could be a Top 10 starting pitcher. He showed off his talent yesterday against the Angels, tossing 6.0 shutout innings allowing 3 H and 0 BB, striking out 9. He was limited to 136.0 innings this season, but racked up 156 K vs. 37 BB while posting a 2.98 ERA and 1.10 WHIP. Throw in a 45.0% groundball rate entering the day, as well as believable metrics (75.0% strand rate, .301 BABIP) and what exactly is there not to like? There’s a good chance that he can be had at a bit of a discount, thanks to the injury history, but the upside remains and he’s a must own heading into next season.
7) Kevin Gausman pitches well in defeat…
He unfortunately squared off with Blake Snell, but that shouldn’t detract from the performance. He went 7.0 innings allowing 1 R on 6 H and 0 BB, striking out 9, giving him a strong finish after struggling in his previous outing (6 ER over 4.0 IP). He certainly turned his season around, after posting a disappointing 5.85 ERA in the first half in part due to a .371 BABIP. He showed better strikeout stuff (9.47 K/9 entering the day) and control (3.05 BB/9) in the second half, and it gives us a reminder of what the upside is. He should remain a solid option moving forward.
8) A lackluster outing for Jack Flaherty…
It was supposed to be Carlos Martinez taking the ball, but St. Louis ultimately scratched him with nothing on the line. Flaherty instead got the ball and struggled, allowing 4 R on 5 H and 2 BB, striking out 5, over 5.0 IP. He never really showed much in the Majors this season, with a 6.33 ERA and 1.55 WHIP, and while there is more upside than that we have to remember that he didn’t show much in the way of groundballs at Double or Triple-A this season (40.0% and 41.0%) and he also benefited from some luck (strand rates of 87.0% and 85.5%). There’s definitely appeal and upside, and he’ll be worth the flier if he’s locked into a rotation spot, but don’t assume that he’ll be an immediate ace.
9) Khris Davis continues to emerge as one of the premier power hitters…
He went 2-4 with 1 HR, 1 RBI and 1 R, giving him 43 HR and 110 RBI on the season. Despite playing in a less than stellar home ballpark, Davis has now hit 85 HR over the past two seasons while driving in 212 runs. Sure the average is never going to be tremendous, but when you are hitting this many home runs that’s something you can overlook a little bit easier. If he could ever cut the strikeout down even into the 25% range (he entered the day at 29.9%) he could be a .265 hitter to go along with his immense power. That would make him one of the elite, but even as is he’ll remain a must own option.
10) Collin McHugh ends the year on a high note…
His numbers weren’t quite as impressive as some others, but taking on Boston he allowed 3 ER on 5 H and 1 BB, striking out 8, over 6.0 IP. He finishes the year with a 3.55 ERA and 1.29 WHIP, with 62 K vs. 20 BB over 63.1 IP. The big question comes from his groundball rate, as he entered the day with a 32.5% groundball rate. He’s shown better than that before (41.7% for his career), and he’s again proven that he can post strong strikeout and walk rates. There’s a lot to like here.

"Linklater's war veteran comedy speaks to modern America, says star","LONDON (Reuters) - “Last Flag Flying”, a comedy-drama about Vietnam war veterans, will resonate with Trump’s America, despite, or perhaps because of, its period setting, actor Bryan Cranston said on Sunday after a screening at the London Film Festival.
Set in the United States in December 2003 – when U.S. forces in Iraq were dragging Saddam Hussein out of a “spider hole” - it is the story of three ageing former servicemen who reunite to bury the son of one of them who has been killed in action.
With President Donald Trump saying he could “totally destroy” North Korea and characterizing a dinner with military commanders as “the calm before the storm”, Cranston said “Last Flag Flying” was a timely reminder of the effect on normal Americans of ill-advised military campaigns.
“I think it has a lot of relevance today in the sense that (today) it’s not clear cut as far as the (what are the) intentions of the government or military,” Cranston, acclaimed for his lead role in the TV drama “Breaking Bad”, told Reuters.
“In World War Two, it was the ‘good war’, it was clear and present danger, we had to stop this mad man. Since then, with Vietnam and Iraq, (there are) a lot of questions ... among the troops and the citizens as to if we are doing the right thing and what is the purpose of our being there.”
Cast member Bryan Cranston (R) and director Richard Linklater pose with festival director Claire Stewart as they arrive for the premiere of ""Last Flag Flying"" during the British Film Institute (BFI) London Film Festival at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London, Britain October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde
“Last Flag Flying” was produced by Amazon Studios and directed and co-written by Richard Linklater, whose greatest critical acclaim has been for the naturalistic “Before Sunset” trilogy and the 2014 “Boyhood” which won a slew of Oscar nominations.
Linklater also made comedies including “School of Rock” and “Everybody Wants Some!!”, about skirt-chasing undergraduates. “Last Flag Flying” falls somewhere between the two genres.

The drama and comedy stem from the chemistry between the three leads, each played by a big Hollywood name.
Steve Carell is the awkward shy one who, we assume, was quiet and withdrawn even before the loss of his son. Cranston plays a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking bar owner who is his own best customer, and Laurence Fishburne, is a man who has found God and become an evangelical preacher, preferring to forget the sex and drugs they all indulged in back in ‘Nam.
Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson said the film’s ability to honor the footsoldiers while being critical of the wars they are sent to fight, could hit “an Academy sweet spot, satisfying both the more conservative oldsters and the younger, leftier types.”
Other critics said “Last Flag Flying” lacked the light touch of Linklater’s best work. The Guardian’s Benjamin Lee called it “a half-baked TV movie masquerading as Oscarbait, a curious misstep for the Oscar-nominated indie auteur”.

"U.S. small-cap firms look to spend tax savings on tech, not jobs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Texas-based chain of strip clubs would go on a buying spree. A growing technology company would move fewer jobs overseas. And a regional bank would boost its spending on cybersecurity.
These are some of the uses of the tax savings that small and medium-sized U.S. companies say they would pursue if the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress slashed corporate taxes as promised.
Small companies pay the highest taxes and they would be the main beneficiaries of such a Trump windfall. Reuters contacted the 100 largest companies by market value in the benchmark Russell 2000 index of U.S. small and mid-cap stocks as well as another 50 in the Russell 2000 with no analyst coverage. None of the 17 companies that responded to Reuters queries mentioned boosting their headcount.
The administration has said the tax cuts would largely pay for themselves by spurring more investment and creating jobs.
But companies say they look to spend on technology that will allow them to improve productivity or make acquisitions rather than hire more workers.
“We want to be a company of the future, and technology is one of the key ingredients,” said Keith Cargill, chief executive at Dallas-based Texas Capital Bankshares Inc (TCBI.O), a bank with a market value of $4.2 billion. The tax cut would be a “huge plus” for earnings, Cargill said, but with little impact on the bank’s workforce.
The Russell 2000 companies tend to pay the highest effective tax rates now - an average of 31.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data - and would stand to gain the most if corporate taxes are cut to 20 percent from 35 percent as the Trump administration has proposed.
For large companies in the S&P 500, the average effective tax rate is 28 percent, a reflection of a greater share of overseas business and more leeway in reducing their tax rates.
While few companies would discuss any details in public before outlining them to their shareholders, executives, chief financial officers and treasures say they are already starting to formulate plans for a tax windfall even if they are not certain whether and in what form it will pass.
Neil Hennessy, the chief executive of Novato, California-based Hennessy Advisors Inc (HNNA.O), a mutual fund company, told Reuters he was in “acquisition mode” and would keep looking for targets in the event of a tax cut passing.
STRIP CLUBS AND SHARE BUYBACKS
One of the first firms to publicly discuss a potential tax windfall is RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc (RICK.O), a chain of 40 strip clubs headquartered in Houston, Texas. Its chief executive Eric Scott Langan told analysts on Aug. 9 that a tax cut would allow him to buy more clubs and boost the share price, which he complained failed to reflect the firm’s organic growth.

""I think that's going to change and I think that's when you're going to see the multiple expansion come into play,"" he said during an earnings call.
The tax cut would also affect companies which do not pay taxes now either because they are not yet profitable or are using past losses to offset their tax bills.
Paul Auvil, the chief financial officer at cybersecurity company Proofpoint Inc (PFPT.O), said that the $4 billion market-cap company expects to start paying taxes in 2021 when it no longer be able to offset past losses.
By then the corporate tax rate would need to sink at least below 27 percent, Auvil told Reuters. Otherwise Proofpoint would move its intellectual property to an offshore company in Europe, where corporate taxes are lower, which would mean hiring up to 100 back office staff there, said.
“These are jobs that have every reason to be in the U.S. but it will require tax reform.”
The prospects of a tax cut have helped push the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM.P) up about 10 percent over the last six weeks, compared with a 3.7 percent gain in the fund which tracks S&P 500 .SPX.
If the tax package does pass, large companies will be more likely to buy back their own stock, while smaller firms will probably reinvest in their businesses, said Tom Forte, an analyst at New York based D.A. Davidson.
“These companies are going to take every incremental cost savings from a tax cut and invest it to keep up with the Amazons (AMZN.O) and Ubers,” Forte said.
For instance, Forte expects EBay Inc (EBAY.O) to spend most of the possible windfall on increasing its stock buyback program. A smaller company like Yelp Inc (YELP.N) would probably invest in artificial intelligence technology to better harness its website’s advertising potential, he said.
GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N), meanwhile, would spend more on its service that delivers from restaurants that do not have their own delivery staff, Forte said, while Groupon Inc (GRPN.O) would invest more in marketing and advertising.
Some smaller companies are also considering share buybacks rather any significant changes to their capital allocation.
Thomas Castellano, treasurer at drug delivery company Catalent Inc (CTLT.N), told Reuters that the $5.2 billion company would keep spending on maintaining its 35 locations around the globe and look for possible acquisitions. Any extra money would go to share buybacks and Catalent was unlikely to increase its hiring rate if a tax cut passes, Castellano said.
“We wouldn’t be adding to our headcount because that would affect our margins at a time when we would otherwise see them improving.”"

Teen suspect in Arizona woman's slaying in custody,"A 14-year-old boy sought in the shooting death of a woman in eastern Arizona has been taken into custody, authorities said Wednesday night.
The Navajo County Sheriff's Office said the teen is a suspect in the killing of 54-year-old TerriLynne Collins during a struggle at her family's getaway property and future retirement home. Deputies said they took the teen into custody without incident Wednesday evening.
Phoenix-area lawyer Ernest Collins Jr. said he was on the phone with his wife who had called him as she went to a trailer on the rural property 160 miles northeast of Phoenix in response to a text for help from the couple's 18-year-old daughter.
Collins told The Associated Press that he was able to hear much of what happened during the fatal encounter in Concho, a small rural community.
Trooper Kameron Lee, an Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman, provided the victim's identity but told the AP that investigators did not want to release additional information on the circumstances of the incident, including how TerriLynne Collins was killed.
Collins, an attorney in Mesa, was distraught at times during a phone interview with the AP.
He said he didn't immediately understand what was going on when his wife called him after midnight and woke him from a deep sleep. She was apparently walking to the trailer where their daughter and the daughter's friend were staying at the time.
As he listened to his wife confront the intruder, ""I finally realized that she had someone at gunpoint,"" Collins said.
He immediately called a neighbor in Concho and asked her to send her husband to the Collins' property. The neighbor said he should call 911 instead. When Collins did that, he was told deputies were already dispatched and he believed his wife had called 911 before heading for the trailer.
Collins said he then got back on the call from his wife and heard her speak with the intruder, whom he thinks was wearing a ski mask and was armed with a knife.
""I heard my wife telling him, 'You're just a kid, you're just a stupid kid and you're going to ruin your life,'"" Collins said.
The conversation went back and forth, with the suspect telling Collins' wife to shoot him in the head, the husband said.
""I'm yelling as loud as I can through the phone to shoot the (expletive), shoot him,"" Collins said.
Collins said his wife yelled at their daughter and her friend to run from the trailer and they did, with the daughter hearing a gunshot as she got outside.
""My wife did not come out of the trailer,"" the husband said.
Concho Elementary School District Administrator Steve Yoder said the boy was enrolled as a seventh-grader at the school for 10 days before switching back to home schooling two weeks ago.
Collins said his wife of nearly 21 years was a devout Christian and ""a very devoted mom"" to their six children and that she loved the Concho area, where they planned to retire. ""Everything that we ever wanted was up there and now it's just gone.""
He said he didn't know the suspect.

California wildfires: Calistoga evacuated amid blazes,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption California districts wiped out by wildfires
California officials have ordered an entire town to evacuate as ""conditions have worsened"" in wildfires that have now killed 26 people.
All residents of Calistoga were directed to leave the area on Wednesday night, Napa County officials said.
About 60 prison inmates have joined hard-pressed firefighters in battling the fast-moving blazes, the state fire chief says.
Among the areas scorched by the 22 blazes are marijuana farms.
'Explosive vegetation'
On Thursday morning, Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano said 463 people are still unaccounted for.
Nine hundred people have been reported missing since the fire started on Sunday night, but a large number have been located, he added.
The night before, all 5,000 residents of Calistoga, in Napa County, were told to leave as police blocked traffic from approaching the area.
Geyserville, a town of around 800 people, and the community of Boyes Hot Springs, both in Sonoma, were also evacuated.
""It's going to continue to get worse before it gets better,"" state fire Chief Ken Pimlott said.
He warned that the death toll could rise further.
""We are still impacted by five years of drought,"" he added.
""These fires were driven by the critically dry fuel bed. We are literally looking at explosive vegetation.""
The wildfires, fanned by 50mph (80km/h) wind gusts, have razed more than 3,500 buildings and homes spanning 170,000 acres (68,800 hectares).
Interactive Slide the button to see how a Santa Rosa community was devastated After Before
Renewed high winds are fanning the ""catastrophic"" blazes, said state fire officials, which were spreading unpredictably in their fourth day.
Firefighters are going door to door in the state's wine-producing region, evacuating those left behind ahead of the next wave of blazes.
Some homeowners complained that the flames had reached their doors ahead of any official warnings.
Many residents did not receive notifications on their mobile phones, similar to the Amber Alert issued for missing children.
Sheriff Giordano said Sonoma County uses a system that requires sign-up to receive such messages.

The wildfires have damaged or demolished at least 13 Napa Valley wineries, a vintners' trade group says.
Cannabis plantations in fire-scorched Mendocino County could lose millions as many are uninsured, according to Nikki Lastreto of the local industry association.
Marijuana farmers cannot insure their businesses since federal law bans the drug.
Though recreational cannabis was legalised in the state in 2016, California's retail market does not open until next January.

This means some farmers who have invested millions may be left without a business once the smoke clears.
The fires are among the deadliest in California's history and have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, about 50 miles away.
More than 200 fire engines and crews are being rushed to California from the rest of the US, officials said.
Mr Pimlott said 73 helicopters, 30 air tankers and nearly 8,000 firefighters were currently battling the blazes.

The conflagration has reduced entire neighbourhoods in the city of Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 people, to ash.
Fourteen of the deaths have occurred in Sonoma County, officials say.
Some 25,000 people across the county have been evacuated and 40,000 homes are without power.
Six people have died in Mendocino County, four in Yuba County and two in Napa County, officials said."

Pacific Ring of Fire Waking Up? Major Geological Events Trigger Concerns,"Something is going on in the Pacific Ring of Fire and everyone needs to be prepared.
 
In the past few months, the world has been inundated with stories of devastating natural disasters which have caused waves of catastrophe across parts of North and Central America and Asia. These events have brought into sharp relief how vulnerable and fragile humanity is when faced with the shocking force of the planet’s natural ebbs and flows.

The 'Ring of Fire' is Shaking Violently - Massive Uptick in Earthquakes

Scientists: Geological evidence shows the Great Sphinx is 800,000 years old
 
According to experts, it is evident that the Earth is currently undergoing some major shifts. Potentially, the most vulnerable part of the Earth is the region known as the Pacific ring of fire which lies on the perimeter of the Pacific Ocean basin. The Pacific ring of fire is an area of intense seismic activity which is populated by an enormous circle of almost five hundred volcanoes, the majority of which are active to some degree. Signs suggest that this vast region of the Earth, which is responsible for the vast majority of earthquakes and volcanic activity on the planet, is about to undergo a major shift which could spell catastrophe for millions of people who live in its vicinity.
 
Recently, more than ten thousand people were ordered to leave their homes on the Melanesian island of Vanuatu which lies on the south western perimeter of the ring of fire owing to the serious eruptions of Mount Manaro. It is believed that this eruption will be the first in a series of volcanic explosions over the next couple of months with Mount Agung in Bali showing clear signs that it will also erupt in the very near future.
 
<img src=""http://en.es-static.us/upl/2015/12/hawaii_volcano.jpg"">
 
The news that Oceania is becoming affected by the shifts in the Earth’s core follows devastating scenes across North and South America following an unusual spate of volcanic activity. Mexico was recently struck with a catastrophic eruption of the Popocatépetl volcano which lies to the south-east of Mexico City. The eruption triggered two devastating earthquakes which caused significant damage to the city and an enormous loss of life. Meanwhile, in Costa Rica, there have been three significant volcanic eruptions in the past year and a series of earthquakes.
 
<img src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9ZZYrsWsAADvwS.jpg"">
 
The seismic events in Mexico were followed by a burst of earthquakes in the United States, with several being detected off the coast of California giving rise to fears that the build-up of pressure on the San Andreas fault is coming to a potentially catastrophic conclusion. The United States is considered to be particularly vulnerable to the shifts in seismic activity owing to the presence of the super volcano in Yellowstone national park which has been showing signs of unusual activity with a swarm of minor earthquakes in recent months. In addition to the presence of Yellowstone and the San Andreas fault line, the United States is also home to the Cascadia subduction zone which has the potential to produce a mega-thrust earthquake reaching a magnitude of more than nine on the Richter scale which could devastate the coast of Washington State, Oregon, and British Colombia.

Final Thoughts
 
The renewed bursts of seismic activity all over the world could prove catastrophic for human beings and serves to demonstrate how fragile human beings truly when confronted with the forces of nature and how helpless even the most powerful governments in the world are to protect their citizens against the power of the Earth. Given the potential for serious disaster all over the world, it would now be wise for everyone to prepare for worst case scenarios to protect themselves and their families from the destruction caused by natural disasters as recent events have shown that the governments of the world are simply not equipped to deal with the protection of their citizens in the midst of devastating natural disasters.

President Donald Trump speaks during the opening of his “Cut the Red Tape” deregulation summit to highlight efforts underway to reduce government rules that hinder private businesses and infrastructure projects. The summit will “highlight the president’s broader initiatives on regulatory reform,” a senior administration official told reporters on Friday. The administration hopes to show that “the regulatory burden is being lifted, that agencies are working hard at accomplishing the president’s directives, and that this is making a difference both to the economy and to job creation.” During the summit, 10 federal agencies will hold breakout sessions to discuss the efforts in their departments and agencies to eliminate burdensome regulations. Trump has eliminated or delayed more than 800 proposed regulations since being elected which the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) says has saved more than $300 million. “We are making good on that promise at OIRA,” OIRA Administrator Naomi Rao said. “So far, we’ve finalized four new regulatory rulemakings and 10 deregulatory rulemakings.” The results have been “quite remarkable,” she said. Trump will deliver his remarks from the East Room of the White House just after 11 AM EDT.

State Department denies Tillerson called Trump a 'moron',"A State Department spokesperson denied that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ever called President Donald Trump a ""moron"" as reported earlier today.
""The secretary does not use that type of language. The secretary did not use that type of language to speak about the president of the United States. He does not use that language to speak about anyone ... he did not say that,"" spokesperson Heather Nauert said this afternoon.
Tillerson today reaffirmed his support for Trump, and said he never thought about stepping down from his post. But he would not answer if he ever used the word ""moron"" to describe Trump.
""I'm not going to deal with petty stuff like that. This is what I don't understand about Washington. I'm not from here,"" he said. ""That kind of petty nonsense — it is intended to do nothing but divide people.""
A new NBC report claimed Tillerson called Trump a ""moron"" after a meeting with national security advisers in July. NBC is standing by its reporting.
The report also included that Vice President Mike Pence urged Tillerson not to resign. Tillerson said that was ""erroneously reported.""
""I have never considered leaving this post,"" Tillerson said.
During a visit with first responders today in Las Vegas after Tillerson's public statement, Trump said that he ""very honored by his comments.""
Tillerson said that his commitment to Trump and the administration ""is as strong as it was"" on his first day in office and that the president has ""given voice to millions who felt completely abandoned to the political status quo.""
Trump has reportedly been disappointed by Tillerson's performance and Tillerson has been equally frustrated with Trump.
On Oct. 1, referring to the missile threat posed by North Korea and using his nickname for its leader Kim Jong Un, Trump tweeted, ""Our wonderful Secretary of State ... is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man… Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!""
Trump posted the tweet one day after Tillerson said the administration was speaking to North Korea ""directly, through our own channels.""
Another time the two publicly disagreed on diplomatic strategies was in June, when Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis said the U.S. and China were pushing ahead on applying diplomatic pressure on North Korea. At the time, Trump tweeted that while he appreciated China's efforts, they have ""not worked out.""
Rumors of Tillerson's possible resignation in July were swatted down by the State Department. At the time, tensions between the White House and Tillerson were allegedly high over staffing at the State Department and Tillerson's ability to make decisions about the nation's foreign policy agency, senior administration officials told ABC News."

"Caspar McCloud Releases First Acoustic Worship Album ""Pictures Of Jesus""","Caspar McCloud Releases First Acoustic Worship Album “Pictures Of Jesus”
(Before It's News)
Caspar McCloud, virtuoso guitarist and vocalist, has just released his first acoustic album, unveiling to the world what close friends, church members, and conference attendee's have previously only been able to enjoy in person. Caspar's album, titled Pictures of Jesus – Acoustic Worship, features 14 originals, with heartfelt, thoughtfully rendered lyrics and acoustic guitar. The vocals show the strength, maturity and gentle power of his emotions from song to song. The album tastefully features numerous shining examples of Caspar's unmatched guitar solo abilities woven throughout every track; the care, attention, and composition all prevail as a display of musicianship that comes only from a seasoned professional. Caspar's recording career goes back to earlier days as a signed Atlantic Records recording artist, through many years of album releases in his name and with his band Ministry of Three. Pictures of Jesus - Acoustic Worship provides the listener with the first opportunity to hear the simple, refined nature of his talent without the amplifiers and larger-than-life band elements of past releases. This is a rare glimpse into genius in its most exposed, direct, and masterfully polished form. ""The past several years I have been asked to speak and play at a number of conferences, events and churches..."" Caspar shares. ""Playing without my band meant singing my songs playing my acoustic guitar whilst exploring new realms of possibilities without other musicians. Ludwig van Beethoven was once quoted as saying 'The guitar is a miniature orchestra in itself.' Over the last few years numerous people, including my good friend Trey Smith (God in A Nutshell) have greatly encouraged me by asking when will there be a recording of these acoustic songs you have played for us? My long time friend and fellow artist, musician, erudite theologian, and software inventor Michael Angel took on the task of producing my first all acoustic album which shall be released in a few days time.” Pictures of Jesus – Acoustic Worship is available through all major online distributors and will release via CD shortly after launch.

James Murdoch wins backing of Sky shareholders to stay as chairman,"FILE PHOTO - James Murdoch, the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and his wife Kathryn Hufschmid arrive for a reception to celebrate the wedding between Rupert Murdoch and former supermodel Jerry Hall which took place on Friday, in London, Britain March 5, 2016. REUTERS/Neil Hall
LONDON (Reuters) - A majority of independent votes cast at the annual shareholders’ meeting of Sky (SKYB.L) on Thursday supported the re-election of James Murdoch as chairman, a spokesman for the European pay TV group said.
Ahead of the meeting some shareholders had said they were planning to oppose Murdoch’s re-election because they did not believe he could effectively represent independent investors as he is also chief executive of Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O).
Twenty-First Century Fox, which already owns 39 percent of Sky, agreed to buy the rest of the company in December 2016, a deal which is currently being reviewed by Britain’s competition regulators.
At Sky’s AGM, independent director Martin Gilbert said he was “pretty confident” past events at Fox News in the United States would not affect the UK Competition and Markets Authority’s current review of the deal.
Gilbert’s comment was a reference to allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News."

Trump Administration Urges Congress To Renew Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA),"By Aaron Kesel
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is urging Congress to “promptly” reauthorize section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) scheduled to expire at the end of this year.
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Dan Coats also signed the letter, addressed to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
Section 702 of FISA “allows the Intelligence Community, under a robust regime of oversight by all three branches of government, to collect vital information about international terrorists, cyber actors, individuals and entities engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other important foreign intelligence targets located outside the United States,” Sessions and Coats wrote.
They added: “Reauthorizing this critical authority is the top legislative priority of the Department of Justice and the Intelligence Community. As publicly reported by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, information collected under one particular section of FAA, Section 702, produces significant foreign intelligence that is vital to protect the nation against international terrorism and other threats.”
FISA was enacted in 1978 as a response to illegal domestic surveillance operations revealed by two Senate committees in the 1970s, including President Richard Nixon’s use of federal intelligence agencies to monitor his political opponents. It was brought into law “to authorize electronic surveillance to obtain foreign intelligence information.”
The law requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court before setting up an electronic or physical wiretap targeted at foreigners and foreign agents.
Congress amended FISA in 2007 to let the government wiretap communications that either begin or end outside the United States jurisdiction without Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) approval; in a stronger 2008 overhaul, they further limited that power to non-U.S. persons. The last reauthorization of the act was in 2012, which set the current expiration date of Dec. 31, 2017.
The FISA law has long been criticized by privacy and civil liberties advocates like the EFF who say the order allows broad, intrusive spying without oversight. The section first gained renewed attention following the 2013 disclosures by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the agency carried out widespread monitoring of emails and other electronic communications through Prism, XKeyScore, Upstream and other NSA surveillance programs. In fact, the first Snowden leak was a FISC order issued to Verizon under Section 702 that required the company to turn over all of its calling records to the NSA.
In June earlier this year, President Trump’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Tom Bossert also urged Congress to review the piece of legislation before it expires on December 31st.

(Before It's News)
Until Antonio Brown lucked his way through Eric Weddle and over the goalline (thanks, Dean “Swiss” Pees, for letting Pittsburgh march down the field unimpeded, btw!), it looked like the Ravens were about to beat Pittsburgh for the FIFTH straight time. As it stands, the good guys have still won six of eight and nine of 13. Hopefully they can make it seven of nine on Sunday.
Let’s look at this week’s stats, quotes, and more, c/o Casa Mia’s White Marsh.
KNOW THY ENEMY
SERIES HISTORY
QUOTES OF THE WEEK
QB Joe Flacco on how the team approaches this upcoming game against Pittsburgh after a Week 3 defeat:
“You’ve got to keep guys’ heads up. So much of this game is confidence and going out there and getting it done. If you let one of these kinds of games creep into your mind and debilitate you, then you’ll be in trouble. So we’ve just got to make sure we keep our heads up and keep going.”
G Tony Bergstrom on John Harbaugh and the culture that’s been set in Baltimore:
“I can’t even describe what a great place it is. … The culture that coach Harbaugh has created here is unmatchable in the NFL.”
John Harbaugh on how to explain the Ravens’ rash of injuries and working with injured players:
“We don’t forget our [injured] guys. Tavon [Young] is in there every single day rehabbing and getting ready for next year, and I see him every day and talk to him. Those guys are still part of our team. The team is more than the original depth chart. The team is an evolving process. It is guys on the practice squad. It is young guys developing as players. It is guys you bring in when you have to – when you have some of the injuries we have at certain positions. There is no one single answer. I can’t answer it any better than you can, but I am not trying to. I don’t think you have to. You have to move on, and you make the best of it.”
The Baltimore Sun’s Childs Walker on the Ravens’ defensive rookies making a long-lasting impact:
“[Tyus] Bowser, meanwhile, has already become an important cog in the defense, lining up on the other side from [Terrell] Suggs and also dropping into coverage in a way [Tim] Williams cannot. He had both a sack and an interception against Cleveland [in Week 2], and something tells me that won’t be the only time in his career he pulls off that double. Between the two outside linebackers and first-round pick Marlon Humphrey, who continues to stand out with his aggressive play at cornerback, this could go down as a memorable defensive draft class.”
John Harbaugh on the depth and competition of the defensive line:
“The competition at D-line is heated. It is tremendous. Those guys want to play, and they are fighting like crazy in practice. It makes our practices better. We have young players that need to get better, and when they get their chance, they need to play well.”
GETTING TO KNOW YOU ~ Q&A with C.J. Mosley
What is the best thing a coach could say about you?
“I’m dedicated, I work hard, and I take my job seriously. You never want anybody to say that you are a lazy player or that you don’t have a good work ethic. As a man and as a football player, working hard and taking my job seriously are two things I pride myself in and that is what I want them to notice.”
After reaching the Pro Bowl in two out of your first three years, what drives you?
“I feel like I’m not one of the top linebackers in the league, at least recognition-wise. I always want to be the best, but I feel like right now, I’m regarded as ‘another good linebacker.’ I want to strive to be one of the best, if not the best, linebackers in the league. Team-wise, I want to lead this defense to be the best defense the NFL has ever seen, and I want to win a Super Bowl.”
What was your advice to your brother, Jamey, who plays at Alabama?
“He took a different route than me. He didn’t get a scholarship like I did; he had to earn his scholarship. He just had his second start this year, so his journey started way different. It has been a tough road for him, but he has kept his head up and has started to earn some playing time. I have definitely talked to him a few times, because there were times where he felt like he put all of the work in during practice and still wasn’t playing. Even though he has my last name, he is definitely making his own way.”
What has been your favorite win so far while in Baltimore?
“I guess it is always good to beat the Steelers. But, I honestly don’t think we have had that big, key win since I have been here. We are hoping that comes this year.”
What about your hardest loss?
“The hardest loss is definitely last year against the Steelers [in Game 15]. Losing on the last play in such a big game made that really tough. When you lose a game like that, it’s going to stick with you and serve as motivation.”
What makes John Harbaugh who he is?
“His drive for perfection. As a man, as a coach himself and what he demands from other coaches and this team. He always looks for ways to find an advantage and preaches practicing the little things, so when a situation comes in a game, we are almost always prepared for it.”
Who was your favorite NFL team and player growing up?
“It’s funny, because my favorite teams were because of my favorite players. It was the Ravens and the Bears – because of Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher.”
HEY, YOU LOOK FAMILIAR! ~ Key Connections
Ravens WR Mike Wallace (left) was selected by the Steelers in the third round of the 2009 draft and spent four seasons in Pittsburgh. … CB Brandon Boykin (Injured Reserve) also spent the 2015 season with the Steelers.
Steelers practice squad RB Fitzgerald Toussaint started his career as a Raven as a rookie free agent. … Steelers LB James Harrison was signed to the Ravens’ offseason roster in 2004.
Steelers inside linebackers coach Jerry Olsavsky (1998) and defensive backs coach Carnell Lake (2001) played the final seasons of their NFL careers with the Ravens.
Steelers WRs coach Richard Mann served in the same capacity for the Baltimore Colts (1982-84) and Baltimore Ravens (1997-98). In 1985, Mann was hired as the wide receivers/tight ends coach for the Browns, where he coached Ravens GM/executive vice president and Hall of Fame TE Ozzie Newsome (1978-90).
Steelers S Sean Davis (2011-15) and WR Darrius Heyward-Bey(2005-08) played at Maryland.
Ravens QB Joe Flacco originally began his collegiate career at Pitt (2003-04) before transferring to Delaware (2005-07).
Ravens defensive coordinator Dean Pees was the head coach at Kent State (1998-2003) when Steelers LB James Harrison played for the Golden Flashes from 1998-2001.

Slovenia v Scotland: Craig Gordon says Scots must 'grasp World Cup moment',"Craig Gordon has not conceded a goal in his past three qualifying games
World Cup qualifying: Slovenia v Scotland Venue: Stozice Stadium Date: Sunday, 8 October Kick-off: 17:00 BST Coverage: Listen on BBC Radio Scotland; live text commentary on the BBC Sport website
Scotland keeper Craig Gordon says missing out on Euro 2008 a decade ago will spur him on as the team seek the win over Slovenia that would ensure a World Cup play-off.
Gordon was part of Alex McLeish's side beaten by Italy at Hampden in 2007 and Scotland have not been at a major tournament since the 1998 World Cup.
""I thought there might be many more opportunities to come at that stage - but there haven't been,"" he said.
""It is a big moment to try and grasp.""
Media playback is not supported on this device It won't be easy, says Scotland's Gordon
Scotland now know victory in Ljubljana on Sunday (17:00 BST kick-off) will guarantee them second place in Group F and, crucially, that they would be one of the eight best group runners-up.
""At 34, nearly 35, it is something that might not come again,"" added Celtic's Gordon.
""Hopefully we can all play as if it is our last opportunity and try and grab it.""
Chris Martin's 88th-minute winner against Slovenia sparked Scotland's resurgence
A 1-0 win over Slovenia at Hampden in March, courtesy of a late Chris Martin goal, was the start of Scotland's five-game unbeaten run.
""That was a big moment in the group for us,"" acknowledged Gordon, who has kept a clean sheet in four of those games, including the past three.
""If that didn't happen and we only got a draw, we probably wouldn't be sitting here now and hoping to get a play-off place. That gave us a lot of confidence and we have gone on a good run from there.
""We are in a good place, especially after the start of the campaign. It is up to us now to try to get one more win. We have done well over the last four or five games to put ourselves in this position, and now we have to make that final jump and get the points to make sure we do it.""
Play-off table as it stands Position/Team Played Goal difference Goals scored Pts 1 Portugal 7 +18 22 18 2 Italy 7 +3 11 14 3 Sweden 7 +10 17 13 4 Denmark 7 +7 12 13 5 Northern Ireland 7 +5 10 13 6 Greece 8 +4 9 13 7 Wales 7 +2 7 11 8 Croatia 7 +2 6 11 9 Scotland 7 -1 8 11
'Confidence is as high as it possibly could be'
Scotland kept their World Cup qualifying hopes alive in dramatic fashion on Thursday as a late Martin Skrtel own goal gave them victory over 10-man Slovakia at Hampden Park.
Far from trying to shut out the excitement surrounding the national team's late surge to the brink of a play-off place, Gordon says the squad should relish it.
""We are actually happy we are in this situation we have got ourselves in - it is not something we should burden ourselves with,"" he added.
""It is great to be involved in this and have this opportunity. We have earned it. No matter how we started, we are finishing well.
""We are on a great run. Confidence is as high as it possibly could be.""
Slovenia, although virtually out of play-off contention, have not conceded a goal at home during qualifying and Scotland manager Gordon Strachan has said his side face a ""hard, hard job"".
Gordon added: ""We are up against a good team and we have to pay attention to that. They have got dangerous players that can hurt us.
""We have still got a very big task. I think everybody is thinking it is maybe going to be easy, but it isn't.
""They have got one of the best goalkeepers in the world and a mean defence. We are going to have to really play well, create chances - and hopefully take one."""
Apple nears TV deal with Spielberg for 'Amazing Stories',"FILE PHOTO: Director Steven Spielberg poses at the premiere of the HBO documentary film ""Spielberg"" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is finalizing a deal to make 10 new episodes of Steven Spielberg’s 1980s science fiction anthology series “Amazing Stories,” landing a premiere Hollywood talent for its plunge into original TV programming, a source with knowledge of the discussions said.
The series would be produced for Apple by Spielberg’s Amblin Television and Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal television production unit. “Amazing Stories” originally ran on the NBC broadcast network.
“We love being at the forefront of Apple’s investment in scripted programming,” NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke said in a statement about the show’s planned revival.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Amblin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The deal is the first to be made public since Apple hired veteran Sony executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg in June to expand the iPhone maker’s push into original programming, a field crowded with streaming services and traditional networks.
It is unclear how people will be able to watch “Amazing Stories” or when it will debut. Apple has not divulged if it will put its own TV series in the iTunes Store, where it sells shows made by other companies, or on another platform.
The deal with Spielberg fits with a strategy Apple executives have outlined in meetings with Hollywood executives. Apple has emphasized in the discussions that it wants prestigious programming and to work with A-list actors, producers and writers, according to sources with knowledge of Apple’s plans.
The company already has placed bids on other projects, including for a comedy series about morning television starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, sources said.
“They are looking for really high-end premium stuff they feel is creatively in line with the Apple brand,” one source said of Apple’s strategy.
The technology company is competing with several established players that have hooked big name stars, such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and Time Warner Inc’s (TWX.N) HBO, plus newer entrants like Facebook Inc FB.N.
Apple has committed $1 billion to start its programming push, the sources said. Netflix, by comparison, says it will spend up to $7 billion on content next year.
The budget for “Amazing Stories” will be more than $5 million per episode, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported that Apple had reached a deal for the series."
ICE Rounds Up Nearly 500 Illegal Aliens Primarily from Sanctuary Cities,"ICE Rounds Up Nearly 500 Illegal Aliens Primarily from Sanctuary Cities

By Rich Mitchell
Immigration officials announced Thursday that they had arrested almost 500 illegal aliens during a 4-day operation. Operation “Safe City” was conducted mainly in sanctuary cities that intend to shield illegals from deportation. Baltimore, Denver, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, Washington, Cook County Illinois, Santa Clara County, California and areas in Massachusetts. “Sanctuary jurisdictions that do not honor detainers or allow us access to jails and prisons are shielding criminal aliens from immigration enforcement and creating a magnet for illegal immigration,” ICE Acting Director Tom Homan, said in a statement. “As a result, ICE is forced to dedicate more resources to conduct at-large arrests in these communities.” “It’s clearly a political move that is not actually geared toward public safety,” Talia Inlender, an immigrant advocate, told the Los Angeles Times. According to an ICE statement those arrested included many illegals charged with multiple crimes: In Baltimore, a citizen of El Salvador who entered the U.S. illegally on a fraudulent passport, and was previously charged with attempted murder/conspiracy to commit murder and convicted of first-degree assault. She was previously released from local custody before ICE could assume custody. In Boston, a citizen of India who entered the U.S. illegally and who was convicted of …

IOC suspends Brazil's Nuzman after arrest over vote-buying allegations,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Brazil’s national Olympic committee (COB) and its head Carlos Nuzman were provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee on Friday, a day after the 75-year-old was arrested in Rio de Janeiro in connection with a corruption investigation.
However, the IOC said in a statement Brazilian athletes would not be affected and Team Brazil would be able to take part at next year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
Nuzman, a former IOC member and now honorary member, is accused of arranging more than $2 million in bribes to get the IOC to pick Rio de Janeiro as host of the 2016 Olympic Games and faces allegations including corruption and money-laundering. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Rio was awarded the Games in 2009, successfully bidding against Chicago, Tokyo and Madrid.
The IOC said Nuzman would provisionally lose all the “the rights, prerogatives and functions” deriving from his IOC status and that he would be withdrawn from the coordination commission for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The COB was suspended because it was responsible for Rio’s bid to stage the Games, the IOC said. As a result, subsidies and payments from the IOC have been frozen.

“This decision shall not affect the Brazilian athletes,” it added. “The IOC will accept a Brazilian Olympic Team in the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018 and in all other competitions under the umbrella of the COB with all rights and obligations.”
The COB in Rio de Janeiro said it did not immediately have any comment to make when contacted by Reuters.
The decision was welcomed by IOC member Richard Peterkin, who has repeatedly criticized the IOC leadership in recent months for its handling of several corruption cases involving members.
”It had to be done,“ Peterkin, an IOC member from St Lucia, said on Facebook. ”There was just too much evidence, some of it self incriminating.

In August 2016, IOC President Thomas Bach awarded the organization’s highest honor, the Olympic Order in gold, to Nuzman, praising his work for the Rio Games.

Nuzman is the latest official to be involved in ongoing corruption investigations and a further blow to the reputation of the Olympics.
Frankie Fredericks, another IOC member, has temporarily stepped down from his posts pending the results of those investigations. He denies any wrongdoing.
Senior IOC member Patrick Hickey, who has also vehemently denied any wrongdoing, has imposed a self-suspension since he was involved in an Irish Olympic Committee ticket scandal and in September resigned from the IOC Executive Board.
Nelio Machado, a lawyer for Nuzman, told reporters on Thursday that the vote-buying accusations were unfounded.
Brazilian police first raided Nuzman’s home in September and accused him of paying a $2 million bribe to the son of Lamine Diack, a former IOC member from Senegal and former head of the international athletics federation (IAAF).
Both Diack and his son have denied the allegations. Namibian Fredericks has admitted receiving money from Diack’s son but has said it was for professional services rendered.
Marcelo Bretas, the federal judge who authorized the arrests, said on Thursday that new evidence indicated that Nuzman’s role in the alleged vote-buying scheme was “more relevant” than previously thought."
7 Truly Terrible Things The Agency Has Done In 70 Years,"By Carey Wedler
On Monday, President Trump tweeted birthday wishes to the Air Force and the CIA. Both became official organizations 70 years ago on September 18, 1947, with the implementation of the National Security Act of 1947.
After spending years as a wartime intelligence agency called the Office of Strategic Services, the agency was solidified as a key player in the federal government’s operations with then-President Harry Truman’s authorization.
In the seventy years since, the CIA has committed a wide variety of misdeeds, crimes, coups, and violence. Here are seven of the worst programs they’ve carried out (that are known to the public):
1 – Toppling governments around the world — The CIA is best known for its first coup, Operation Ajax, in 1953, in which it ousted the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammed Mossadegh, reinstating the autocratic Shah, who favored western oil interests. That operation, which the CIA now admits to waging with British intelligence, ultimately resulted in the 1979 revolution and subsequent U.S. hostage crisis. Relations between the U.S. and Iran remain strained to this day, aptly described by the CIA-coined term “blowback.”
But the CIA has had a hand in toppling a number of other democratically elected governments, from Guatemala (1954) and the Congo (1960) to the Dominican Republic (1961), South Vietnam (1963), Brazil (1964), and Chile (1973). The CIA has aimed to install leaders who appease American interests, often empowering oppressive, violent dictators. This is only a partial list of countries where the CIA covertly attempted to exploit and manipulate sovereign nations’ governments.
2 – Operation Paperclip — In one of the more bizarre CIA plots, the agency and other government departments employed Nazi scientists both within and outside the United States to gain an advantage over the Soviets. As summarized by NPR:
The aim [of Operation Paperclip] was to find and preserve German weapons, including biological and chemical agents, but American scientific intelligence officers quickly realized the weapons themselves were not enough. They decided the United States needed to bring the Nazi scientists themselves to the U.S. Thus began a mission to recruit top Nazi doctors, physicists and chemists — including Wernher von Braun, who went on to design the rockets that took man to the moon.
They kept this plot secret, though they admitted to it upon the release of Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program That Brought Nazi Scientists To America by Annie Jacobsen. In a book review, the CIA wrote that “Henry Wallace, former vice president and secretary of commerce, believed the scientists’ ideas could launch new civilian industries and produce jobs.”
They praised the book’s historical accuracy, noting “that the Launch Operations Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, was headed by Kurt Debus, an ardent Nazi.” They acknowledged that “General Reinhard Gehlen, former head of Nazi intelligence operations against the Soviets, was hired by the US Army and later by the CIA to operate 600 ex-Nazi agents in the Soviet zone of occupied Germany.”
Remarkably, they noted that Jacobsen “understandably questions the morality of the decision to hire Nazi SS scientists,” but praise her for pointing out that it was done to fight Soviets. They also made sure to add that the Soviets hired Nazis, too, apparently justifying their own questionable actions by citing their most loathed enemy.
3 – Operation CHAOS — The FBI is widely known for its COINTELPRO schemes to undermine communist movements in the 1950s and anti-war, civil rights, and black power movements in the 1960s, but the CIA has not been implicated nearly as deeply because, technically, the CIA cannot legally engage in domestic spying. But that was of little concern to President Lyndon B. Johnson as opposition to the Vietnam war grew. According to former New York Times journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winner Tim Weiner, as documented in his extensive CIA history, Legacy of Ashes, Johnson instructed then-CIA Director Richard Helms to break the law:
In October 1967, a handful of CIA analysts joined in the first big Washington march against the war. The president regarded protesters as enemies of the state. He was convinced that the peace movement was controlled and financed by Moscow and Beijing. He wanted proof. He ordered Richard Helms to produce it. Helms reminded the president that the CIA was barred from spying on Americans. He says Johnson told him: ‘I’m quite aware of that. What I want for you is to pursue this matter, and to do what is necessary to track down the foreign communists who are behind this intolerable interference in our domestic affairs…’
Helms obeyed. Weiner wrote:
In a blatant violation of his powers under the law, the director of central intelligence became a part-time secret police chief. The CIA undertook a domestic surveillance operation, code-named Chaos. It went on for almost seven years… Eleven CIA officers grew long hair, learned the jargon of the New Left, and went off to infiltrate peace groups in the United States and Europe.
According to Weiner, “the agency compiled a computer index of 300,000 names of American people and organizations, and extensive files on 7,200 citizens. It began working in secret with police departments all over America.” Because they could not draw a “clear distinction” between the new far left and mainstream opposition to the war, the CIA spied on every major peace organization in the country. President Johnson also wanted them to prove a connection between foreign communists and the black power movement. “The agency tried its best,” Weiner noted, ultimately noting that “the CIA never found a shred of evidence that linked the leaders of the American left or the black-power movement to foreign governments.”
4 – Infiltrating the media — Over the years, the CIA has successfully gained influence in the news media, as well as popular media like film and television. Its influence over the news began almost immediately after the agency was formed. As Weiner explained, CIA Director Allen Dulles established firm ties with newspapers:
Dulles kept in close touch with the men who ran the New York Times, The Washington Post, and the nation’s leading weekly magazines. He could pick up the phone and edit a breaking story, make sure an irritating foreign correspondent was yanked from the field, or hire the services of men such as Time’s Berlin bureau chief and Newsweek’s man in Tokyo.
He continued:
It was second nature for Dulles to plant stories in the press. American newsrooms were dominated by veterans of the government’s wartime propaganda branch, the Office of War Information…The men who responded to the CIA’s call included Henry Luce and his editors at Time, Life, and Fortune; popular magazines such as Parade, the Saturday Review, and Reader’s Digest; and the most powerful executives at CBS News. Dulles built a public-relations and propaganda machine that came to include more than fifty news organizations, a dozen publishing houses, and personal pledges of support from men such as Axel Springer, West Germany’s most powerful press baron.
The CIA’s influence had not waned by 1977 when journalist Carl Bernstein reported on publications with CIA agents in their employ, as well as “more than 400 American journalists who in the past twenty?five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency.”
The CIA has also successfully advised on and influenced numerous television shows, such as Homeland and 24 and films like Zero Dark Thirty and Argo, which push narratives that ultimately favor the agency. According to Tricia Jenkins, author of The CIA in Hollywood: How the Agency Shapes Film & Television, a concerted agency effort began in the 1990s to counteract negative public perceptions of the CIA, but their influence reaches back decades. In the 1950s, filmmakers produced films for the CIA, including the 1954 film adaptation of George Orwell’s Animal Farm.
Researchers Tom Secker and Matthew Alford, whose work has been published in the American Journal of Economics and Sociology, say their recent Freedom of Information Act requests have shown that the CIA — along with the military — have influenced over 1,800 films and television shows, many of which have nothing to do with CIA or military themes.
5 – Drug-induced Mind control – In the 1950s, the CIA began experimenting with drugs to determine whether they might be useful in extracting information. As Smithsonian Magazine has noted of the MKUltra project:
The project, which continued for more than a decade, was originally intended to make sure the United States government kept up with presumed Soviet advances in mind-control technology. It ballooned in scope and its ultimate result, among other things, was illegal drug testing on thousands of Americans.
Further:
The intent of the project was to study ‘the use of biological and chemical materials in altering human behavior,’ according to the official testimony of CIA director Stansfield Turner in 1977. The project was conducted in extreme secrecy, Turner said, because of ethical and legal questions surrounding the program and the negative public response that the CIA anticipated if MKUltra should become public. Under MKUltra, the CIA gave itself the authority to research how drugs could:’ ‘promote the intoxicating effects of alcohol;’ ‘render the induction of hypnosis easier;’ ‘enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion;’ produce amnesia, shock and confusion; and much more. Many of these questions were investigated using unwitting test subjects, like drug-addicted prisoners, marginalized sex workers and terminal cancer patients– ‘people who could not fight back,’ in the words of Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who introduced LSD to the CIA.
Further, as Weiner noted:
Under its auspices, seven prisoners at a federal penitentiary in Kentucky were kept high on LSD for seventy-seven consecutive days. When the CIA slipped the same drug to an army civilian employee, Frank Olson, he leaped out of the window of a New York Hotel.
Weiner added that senior CIA officers destroyed “almost all of the records” of the programs, but that while the “evidence that remains is fragmentary…it strongly suggests that use of secret prisons for the forcible drug-induced questioning of suspect agents went on throughout the 1950s.”
Years later, the CIA would be accused of distributing crack-cocaine into poor black communities, though this is currently less substantiated and supported mostly by accounts of those who claim to have been involved.
6 – Brutal torture tactics — More recently, the CIA was exposed for sponsoring abusive, disturbing terror tactics against detainees at prisons housing terror suspects. An extensive 2014 Senate report documented agents committing sexual abuse, forcing detainees to stand on broken legs, waterboarding them so severely it sometimes led to convulsions, and imposing forced rectal feeding, to name a few examples. Ultimately, the agency had very little actionable intelligence to show for their torture tactics but lied to suggest they did, according to the torture report. Their torture tactics led the International Criminal Court to suggest the CIA, along with the U.S. armed forces, could be guilty of war crimes for their abuses.
7 – Arming radicals — The CIA has a long habit of arming radical, extremist groups that view the United States as enemies. In 1979, the CIA set out to support Afghan rebels in their bid to defeat the Soviet occupation of the Middle Eastern country. As Weiner wrote, in 1979, “Prompted by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter signed a covert-action order for the CIA to provide the Afghan rebels with medical aid, money, and propaganda.”
As Weiner detailed later in his book:
The Pakistani intelligence chiefs who doled out the CIA’s guns and money favored the Afghan factions who proved themselves most capable in battle. Those factions also happened to be the most committed Islamists. No one dreamed that the holy warriors could ever turn their jihad against the United States.
Though some speculate the CIA directly armed Osama bin Laden, that is yet to be fully proven or admitted. What is clear is that western media revered him as a valuable fighter against the Soviets, that he arrived to fight in Afghanistan in1980, and that al-Qaeda emerged from the mujahideen, who were beneficiaries of the CIA’s program. Stanford University has noted that Bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam, a prominent Palestinian cleric, “established Al Qaeda from the fighters, financial resources, and training and recruiting structures left over from the anti-Soviet war.” Much of those “structures” were provided by the agency. Intentionally or not, the CIA helped fuel the rise of the terror group.
Weiner noted that as the CIA failed in other countries like Libya, by the late 1980s “Only the mujahideen, the Afghan holy warriors, were drawing blood and scenting victory. The CIA’s Afghan operation was now a $700-million-dollar-a-year-program” and represented 80% of the overseas budget of the clandestine services. “The CIA’s briefing books never answered the question of what would happen when a militant Islamic army defeated the godless invaders of Afghanistan,” though Tom Twetten, “the number two man in the clandestine service in the summer of 1988,” was tasked with figuring out what would happen with the Afghan rebels. “We don’t have any plan,” he concluded.
Apparently failing to learn their lesson, the CIA adopted nearly the exact same policy in Syria decades later, arming what they called “moderate rebels” against the Assad regime. Those groups ultimately aligned with al-Qaeda groups. One CIA-backed faction made headlines last year for beheading a child (though President Trump cut off the CIA program in June, the military continues to align with “moderate” groups).
Unsurprisingly, this list is far from complete. The CIA has engaged in a wide variety of extrajudicial practice, and there are likely countless transgressions we have yet to learn about.
As Donald Trump cheers the birthday of an agency he himself once criticized, it should be abundantly clear that the nation’s covert spy agency deserves scrutiny and skepticism — not celebration.

China to accept overseas trial data in bid to speed up drug approvals,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China said it plans to accept data from overseas clinical trials to speed up approvals of drugs, a potential boon for international drugmakers as well as patients who often face lengthy delays for new medicines to reach the market.
The move, outlined by the Cabinet late on Sunday, seeks to address high medicine costs and access to healthcare for China’s population of nearly 1.4 billion. In the past 15 years, China has approved just over 100 innovative new drugs, about one-third the number in developed markets.
Accepting overseas clinical data will help global drugmakers at time of growing competition from Chinese rivals in the world’s second-biggest pharmaceuticals market as well as pressure from authorities which are anxious to rein in prices.
“Overall, China’s support for scientific innovation with drugs and medical devices is lacking, and the quality of products on the market still falls short of top international levels,” the draft proposals said.
“We must speed up the examination and approval of urgently needed drugs and medical devices.”
The Cabinet also said it would look to improve the protection of medical intellectual property and boost the number and quality of clinical trial testing centers in China. The proposals contained no timeline for implementation.
“We want to make our drug industry large-scale and strong, make it more competitive, and shift our long-term reliance on imports of new drugs,” Wu Zhen, deputy head of the China Food and Drug Administration, told a briefing on Monday.
“(Some drugs) have been used overseas for 6-7 years before making it to market in China,” Wu added.
China in March proposed ways to speed up approvals for imported drugs, including reforming clinical trial requirements. It also wants to boost its own drug industry and see a shift from generic drugs and towards more innovative medicines and medical equipment.

"U.S. President Donald Trump Quietly Signs Law To Allow Warrantless Searches In Parts Of VA, DC and MD","By Aaron Kesel
As former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said: “You never let a serious crisis go to waste.” While everyone was worried about the hurricanes, U.S. President Donald Trump signed away the Fourth Amendment buried in a new bill. He set a precedent by empowering the police state to allow warrantless searches in parts of VA, MD and D.C. near the Metro train system.
The government can now openly enter and search private property without a warrant in parts of Virginia, Maryland and D.C.
The House Joint Resolution 76 was signed into law on Tuesday, Aug. 22, by President Trump. The text is rather boring, starting off with: “Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.”
CNN explained, “This law lets Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia form a new panel called the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to oversee the safety of the D.C.-area public transportation Metro train system.”
The new safety commission will take over from the current Federal Transit Agency (FTA), which has been in charge of safety oversight for the Washington Metropolitan Area Interstate Compact (WMATA) since October 2015.
“We’ll set this up and get the FTA out of Metro. They are happy to get out, and we’re happy to get them out,” Metro Board of Directors Chair Jack Evans told Bloomberg BNA. “I’m glad we got this thing. If nothing else, we’ll get our money.”
However, buried within the bill’s text is a daunting “one major red flag” that would give the newly formed commission “the authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System ‘without limitation’ and without a warrant, for the purpose of ‘making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing,” The Free Thought Project reported.
The legislation reads:
In performing its duties, the Commission, through its Board or designated employees or agents, may: Enter upon the WMATA Rail System and, upon reasonable notice and a finding by the chief executive officer that a need exists, upon any lands, waters, and premises adjacent to the WMATA Rail System, including, without limitation, property owned or occupied by the federal government, for the purpose of making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing as the Commission may deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this MSC Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass.
Only five Congressman voted against the bill according to U.S. Rep Justin Amash (R-Mich.) while three hundred ninety-nine gave their approval, and 29 didn’t bother to vote at all. Apparently, our elected officials can’t be bothered to stand up for the rights of we the people or the Constitution they swore to protect. After all, the Fourth Amendment doesn’t exist, which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures or anything. As Amash pointed out, the government will now be able to kick in the doors of any private property surrounding the border of the DC Metro Rail System without needing a warrant based on any probable cause.
Only 5 of us voted against bill allowing govt to enter/search private property in parts of VA, MD & DC w/o warrant. https://t.co/SVhTWqbPaB — Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2017 The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad)
A scary prospect indeed, as Rachel Blevins wrote for The Free Thought Project, “While it may only affect the Washington, D.C., metro area now, it could be laying the blueprint for future legislation across the country.”

Which Team Will Grab AFC North Control?,"Which Team Will Grab AFC North Control?
(Before It's News)
Can the Baltimore Ravens bounce back and beat Pittsburgh for the fifth straight time in Baltimore? RSR Staff give our predictions here:
Todd Karpovich
— Both teams are looking to rebound from brutal losses in Week 3. Baltimore will get a boost by playing at home, where the Steelers have not won since since Dec. 2, 2012.
— The Steelers gave up 220 yards on the ground to Chicago last game. Baltimore coach John Harbaugh said this week that running back Alex Collins could get more opportunities. Collins will seize the opportunity and finish with 80 yards and a touchdown.
— Joe Flacco will go back to managing the game and have modest numbers. His streak of nine straight games with an interception will come to an end.
— The Ravens will keep the pressure on Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who will be sacked twice and have an interception. In 19 career games against Baltimore, Roethlisberger has 31 touchdowns passes and 21 interceptions, going 10-9 over that stretch.
— Twelve of the past 18 matchups between Baltimore and Pittsburgh were decided by three points or fewer. This one won’t be any different.
Ravens 24, Steelers, 21
Derek Arnold
I know Ravens fans are feeling down in the dumps after that beating we took in Jacksonville, but how do you think Steelers fans are feeling? They lost to Chicago last week, and the Bears looked like a Division III squad in Green Bay last night.
That’s today’s NFL, man. A whole lotta mediocrity. I’m not convinced that the Ravens are anywhere near as bad as they played last week. Toss that one out, and hopefully they won’t provide any more evidence that they’re 44-7-loss-to-Jacksonville bad.
Steelers fans are nearly as dismayed by the play of Roethlisberger so far this season as we are at Joe’s mishaps. On top of that, Fat Ben is pretty much always bad on the road, and pretty much always bad in Baltimore. Le’Veon Bell hasn’t gotten untracked yet after holding out through training camp.
I think this will be an ugly one, but give me the Ravens and the under.
Ravens 16
Steelers 13
Ryan Jones
Both the Ravens and the Steelers have had uneven starts to the year. Pittsburgh barely beat a Browns team in Cleveland that the Ravens handled fairly easily, then they beat up on a pretty good Vikings team at home before losing to a pretty bad Bears team in the Windy City. Notice a trend? The Steelers aren’t the same team away from Heinz field. Meanwhile, us Ravens fans were feeling pretty good before last weeks debacle.
I expect the Ravens to rebound. The sense of urgency they had entering the season took a brief hiatus last week but this is a make or break year for some players and coaches in the Ravens organization. Even though they got a little cocky and forgot that last week I think we’ll see the offense play better and the defense more closely resemble the one we saw weeks one and two.
Alex Collins leads the team in carries and yards and sets himself up to be the starter going forward. He grinds out 75 tough yards on about 15 carries and scores his first touchdown.
The receivers get more involved and Mike Wallace finally gets the rock. He finishes with 80+ yards including a touchdown of over 30 yards.
Ravens 23
Steelers 20
Carey Stevenson
The Ravens defense still stewing off its London let down return to its dominant self. They’ll get just enough from their run game to keep them on schedule, a run game where Alex Collins takes over as the early down grinder. Out of necessity, Buck Allen catches a TON of check downs and Mike Wallace slips behind the Steeler defense for a big play. The Ravens pull out a typical hard fought game in the teens behind Justin Tucker’s leg.
Ravens 19 Steelers 16
Adam Bonaccorsi
Both the Ravens & Steelers can’t play any worse than last week; the question is who has the better ability to bounce back.
For the Ravens:
-Joe Flacco will bounce back with 2 scores (and the usual pair of picks), hitting Buck Allen twice in the end zone.
-The Ravens will total only 250 yards of offense, with the running backs accounting for 180 of those yards.
-The Ravens defense will steal a pair of Big Ben picks to shorten the field for Baltimore’s anemic offense.
For the Yinzers:
-Big Ben will find Antonio Brown for 2 touchdowns, and a third from Jesse James.
-Le’Veon Bell will be held in check, with under 75 total yards.
-The Steelers defense won’t do anything special, but the Ravens’ decimated offense will be held in check all day thanks to mediocrity.
Unfortunately, the Steelers have the lead in the 1-score game come 4th quarter, and manage to milk to clock to end it, as they steal one from the Ravens who fall to 2-2 and the fans go bonkers asking about top-5 draft picks, whether the Ravens will take a quarterback early, and how soon we can fire everybody.

The Ditch List: Breaking Down Four Players It May Be Time To Cut Bait On,"The Ditch List: Breaking Down Four Players It May Be Time To Cut Bait On
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Not every cut is created equal, and it’s going to depend on your league size/format in many cases. That said there have been some obviously disappointing starts to the season and in the right circumstance three weeks is enough information to formulate a decision, cut bait and move on. Let’s take a look at a few candidates that you should consider dropping:
Joe Flacco – Baltimore Ravens – Quarterback
Calling the trip to London a disastrous one would be an understatement, as Flacco was pulled after going 8-18 for 28 yards, 0 TD and 2 INT. We knew it would be a slow start, after he was nursing injuries throughout the preseason, but he’s now thrown for just 366 yards, 3 TD and 4 INT over the first three weeks of the season. In fact Baltimore has limited him to under 20 passes in two of the three games (though he would’ve thrown more in Week 3 had he not been removed).
You have to think that things will improve, but considering the improvements of players like Jared Goff is it really worth waiting around for a player who would’ve been a low-end option anyways? Especially in single-quarterback formats the time has come to move on.
Cam Newton – Carolina Panthers – Quarterback
Newton is in a similar spot to Flacco, except for the fact that he has the upside of a Top 10 option (and potentially Top 5). While Newton has been working his way back from injury, he’s also watched his top receivers drop like flies with both Greg Olson and now Kelvin Benjamin out for potentially multiple weeks (Olson has already hit the IR). That leaves Newton with a solid running back corps (and Christian McCaffrey is going to be a great receiving option), but little talent on the outside. Devin Funchess (who turned 10 targets into just 4 receptions yesterday) is left as the #1 option, and will be followed by some type of combination f Ed Dickson, Curtis Samuel and a few other underwhelming options.
Newton could be saved by his ability to tuck the ball and run for a TD, but that’s hardly going to be enough. Depending on your waiver wire he’s going to be worth stashing, but in shallower one-quarterback formats there are going to be more dependable options available for the short-term.
Thomas Rawls – Seattle Seahawks – Running Back
Instead of seeing his role increase in his second game on the field, Rawls didn’t get a single touch. Granted it was more of a pass first attack (Russell Wilson attempted 49 passes), but it was Chris Carson (11 carries for 34 yards) and C.J. Prosise (4 carries and 3 receptions) who shared the backfield. Game flow played a role in the decision, but this is a bad sign for Rawls’ outlook moving forward.
We wouldn’t want to have a quick trigger finger, especially if you have the room on your bench to continue stashing him. However viewing him as nothing more than a handcuff, and as droppable in 10-team leagues, is the way to go.
Terrelle Pryor – Washington Redskins – Wide Receiver
Are we really prepared to just dump a player who put up 77 receptions for 1,007 yards and 4 TD a year ago? That may be a stretch, but it’s getting hard to justify utilizing him. Despite Kirk Cousins throwing for 365 yards on Sunday night, Pryor converted just 2 of 4 targets for 19 yards. After being targeted 11 times in Week 1, he has 8 total targets the past two weeks (and overall he has 10 receptions for 116 yards and 0 TD).
Even in his breakout last year Pryor wasn’t a source of TD and it’s possible he was more of a product of his situation playing for a lackluster Browns’ franchise a year ago. At best he’s a player to stash, but he shouldn’t be anywhere near starting lineups.

Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression,"Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.
 
According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.
 
Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.
 
Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.
 
When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as – Enya’s ‘Who Can Say’.

After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.
 
The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home’s basement.
 
According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement’s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.
 
William Provost, who police believe to be the group’s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:
 
 
 “I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don’t, so I stick to what works for me”.
 
 
Upon searching the home’s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.
 
 
Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.
 
In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift ‘tool wall’ that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.
 
 
 
Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.
 
Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.
 
 
“Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I’ve ever heard.”
 
 
 Provost’s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer’s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.
 
 As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.
 
All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.

"Tunisian navy rescues 100 migrants, hours after eight drown","TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia’s navy rescued almost 100 migrants from a sinking boat off its southeast coast late on Monday, authorities said, hours after eight people being smuggled to Europe drowned in the same stretch of water.
The incidents coincided with the launch of joint patrols by the Tunisian and Italian navies to stem migrant flows and carry out search and rescue operations in the area, the Tunisian Defense Ministry said.
Tunisia’s coast has become the launch pad of choice for traffickers transporting migrants from North Africa across the Mediterranean.
Wooden boats packed with migrants, their numbers often swelled by young Tunisians seeking work in Europe, have started landing on secluded Sicilian beaches, often in broad daylight.
Activity via Libya, until recently the busiest country of departure on that route, has declined since July as its coast guard and an armed group in the smuggling hub of Sabratha tightened controls.
The Tunisian Interior Ministry said late on Monday the coast guard pulled 98 Tunisians, including three children, from the sinking vessel near the island of Kerkennah.
Earlier on Monday at least eight people drowned nearby when another boat carrying dozens of migrants collided with a Tunisian navy vessel.
Tunisia has won plaudits from abroad for its transition to democracy since 2011, when an uprising toppled autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali. But unemployment remains high, especially among the country’s youth."
Russia threatens to brand U.S.-sponsored Radio Liberty 'foreign agent',"MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. government-sponsored Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) said on Monday Moscow had threatened to brand their Russian language service projects as “foreign agents” in retaliation for what Moscow calls U.S. pressure on a Kremlin-backed TV station.
Russian officials have accused Washington of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S. operations of RT, a Kremlin-funded broadcaster accused by some in Washington of interfering in domestic U.S. politics, which it denies..
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Sunday Moscow could apply “similar measures” to American journalists and media in Russia. She did not identify any specific U.S. media outlets that would be targeted.
Current Time, which is produced by RFE/RL in cooperation with the Voice of America and mainly targets audiences in Russia and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, said it had received a warning from the Russian Ministry of Justice, threatening to put restrictions on the network.
Two other RFE/RL Russian-language projects, Radio Liberty and Idel. Realias, received the same letters, it said.
“According to Russia’s competent bodies, your organization’s activity falls under the criteria set out in the federal law... for non-commercial organizations - foreign agents. Your organization’s activity may be restricted...,” said the letter, seen by Reuters.
A justice ministry official confirmed to Reuters that such a letter had been sent, adding: “The principle of reciprocity will further be applied depending on the measures applied to Russian media by the United States.”
Responding to the letter, the channel director of Current Time TV, Daisy Sindelar, said in a statement: “We are a journalistic organization, and we trust we will be able to continue our work.”
“We have no concrete information about any moves being taken against RT in the United States, and have no reason to expect reciprocal action”, she added.
Late last month, Russia’s state communications regulator accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating its license to broadcast in Russia and said it had summoned the broadcaster’s representatives in connection with the matter."

When Hinda Miller took up jogging in 1977, she found herself in a predicament — the run was great, but what about the bounce factor?
Her friend Lisa Lindahl was asking herself the same question. So they bought some bras, tore them apart, and went to work on figuring out the perfect support system.
Breasts don’t just move up and down when a woman runs, they move in a figure eight. The idea for a tighter, more form-fitting garment was sparked after Ms. Lindahl’s husband jokingly crisscrossed two jock straps across his chest.
The sports bra, or Jogbra as it was originally known, turns 40 this year.
Sports bras remained largely out of the public eye until the Women’s World Cup in 1999. But after Brandi Chastain scored the decisive penalty kick to give the U.S. a win over China, she dropped to the grass in jubilation and whipped off her jersey, above, revealing her black sports bra.
Ms. Miller later described the indelible scene, in which her invention played a role: “I saw the exuberance of being right out there, confident and joyous and totally committed and not ashamed of your body, a body of strength and athleticism: ‘This is me. Accept me for who I am.’”

Hurricane Damage in Puerto Rico Leads to Fears of Drug Shortages Nationwide,"Thirteen of the drugs, Dr. Gottlieb said, are “sole-source,” meaning the product is made only by one company. Those include H.I.V. medications, injectable drugs and sophisticated medical devices, although he did not name the products. The biggest problem, he said, was not damage to the factories, but the instability of the electric supply. Manufacturers are worried that a long-term lack of connection to a major power grid could jeopardize their products, and are also wary of relying on the more limited electrical grids that the territory is likely to activate as a first step to restoring power.
One of the drugs F.D.A. officials said they were concerned about was methotrexate, which treats childhood leukemia and other diseases. It has been scarce, off and on, for several years. Mylan makes the product in Puerto Rico, and all five manufacturers of the injectable form of the drug have reported shortages of the product, according to a list maintained by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.
In a statement, Mylan did not address the methotrexate shortage but said it was “working closely with F.D.A. to help address drug shortage concerns.” Its plant has sources of water, electricity and communication, and the company said it is “working on ways to make them sustainable for manufacturing purposes.” Like other companies, it said it was focusing on helping employees and other residents of the island with basic needs, including chartering a cargo plane carrying essential goods to deliver to them.
Several pharmaceutical and medical device companies said that their factories were coming back on line with the assistance of generators and that they did not anticipate supply shortfalls. But others said the situation was precarious. Drug companies depend on consistent refrigeration to avoid shortages. And device makers are wondering when the power grid would be back up, which some officials have predicted could take months.
“Everybody is struggling to get diesel fuel — that’s just widespread,” said Antonio Medina, an independent consultant who until last year was executive director of the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company, a government-run group that promotes manufacturing.
Wilberto Maldonado, a pharmaceutical consultant in Puerto Rico, said drug and device makers were navigating a logistical “nightmare,” especially when trying to get access to fuel for their generators.
With phone lines down, “many employers have people still unaccounted for,” Mr. Maldonado said in a message through LinkedIn. “This may not improve, as telecom service providers are also depending on backup generators.”

Industry officials have sought to strike a delicate balance in making their case for help without appearing to divert precious resources from hospital and other emergency services. Returning the drug and device industry to its feet, however, is crucial for ensuring the island’s economic recovery as well as safeguarding the supply of medicines and devices to the rest of the United States.
If the manufacturing plants are slow to fully recover, some companies could shift their production elsewhere, said Deepak Lamba-Nieves, research director at the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan economic think tank in Puerto Rico. “That may have medium and long-term consequences for an island that is going to be hugely and severely impacted by this hurricane for many years to come,” he said.
Lobbyists and executives from health care companies met Tuesday with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make their pitch for assistance.

AdvaMed, the trade group for the device makers, said its requests included priority access as the electricity grid is restored.
“Even if companies are fine now with diesel fuel, we want to make sure we’re in the queue in terms of priority,” said Greg Crist, a spokesman for AdvaMed. “Because if there is an electricity shortage well into November, for example, how can we as an industry make sure we are in line for those priorities, once you’ve taken care of hospitals and essential needs?”
While AdvaMed has outlined its members’ challenges, its pharmaceutical counterpart — the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America — provided fewer specifics and referred questions to Healthcare Ready, an industry group that is coordinating the recovery operations in Puerto Rico.

Several drug companies said that while their plants lost power and were forced to shut down, they were not anticipating a disruption in supply. “We have a strong local team working through incredible logistical challenges, and we’re seeing progress each day,” said Ernie Knewitz, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson. Tylenol and Prezista, an H.I.V. drug, are among the products that the company manufactures in Puerto Rico. “We are also closely monitoring our product inventory levels and will work to ensure all critical needs are met.”
The industry’s rosy outlook, presumably offered in part to assure nervous shareholders, contrasted with the concern expressed by Dr. Gottlieb.
“We know that the grid is going to be unstable for a long period of time,” Dr. Gottlieb said. “The generators were never meant to operate for months and months on end.”

Erin Fox, a drug shortage expert at the University of Utah, said she and other hospital pharmacists were monitoring the situation, and were worried that the storm’s impact could exacerbate the United States’ already dire drug-shortage problem.
Ms. Fox said companies typically do not disclose where they manufacture their drugs because it is considered a trade secret. Several companies declined to list which products they made in Puerto Rico.
“Because we have no transparency around that,” she said, “it’s actually hard to know the true impact of this.”
Baxter, a medical-supply company, has said that it is limiting shipments of products made in Puerto Rico to conserve its supply, including small bags of dextrose and saline, which are used by hospitals to prepare medication. Hospitals will be limited to their typical monthly shipment to prevent some institutions from stockpiling the products.
Ms. Fox said hospitals rely on these small bags of saline solution to mix medicines for patients, and “an allocation doesn’t guarantee that you will get some.”
A few years ago, Baxter was at the center of a shortage of large saline bags that led to state and federal investigations into its business practices.
Baxter said that its three manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico sustained “some damage,” and that “limited production activities” had resumed at all of its plants.
Puerto Rico has been a hub of drug manufacturing for decades — companies were lured to the island because of tax breaks and its access to the United States market, along with skilled employees who worked for lower wages. About a decade ago, expiring tax incentives led to a wave of factory closings, stoking fears that the industry was in jeopardy.
Today, the drug and device industries remain a mainstay of the Puerto Rican economy. Pharmaceutical and medical manufacturing accounted for nearly three-quarters of Puerto Rico’s exports in 2016, of $14.5 billion, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“These are some of the best jobs,” Mr. Medina said.
Dr. Gottlieb hopes the companies stay there.
“A highly skilled, highly dedicated and highly productive Puerto Rican work force enables the success of the industry,” Dr. Gottlieb said. “If they decide to relocate after this disaster, it would jeopardize the island’s economic future.”"

Rose McGowan’s Twitter Account Locked After Posts About Weinstein,"By midmorning on Thursday, as the Twitter universe was in full steam about Ms. McGowan’s situation, the company moved to explain its actions. In a statement, a Twitter representative said Ms. McGowan’s tweets had violated the company’s privacy policy because one of them included a phone number.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
A person familiar with the decision, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was confidential, said the phone number of a prominent person had been visible in a screenshot of an email that Ms. McGowan had posted on the service.
“We want to explain that her account was temporarily locked because one of her tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service,” Twitter said of Ms. McGowan’s account. “The tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked. We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future.”
Twitter can and often does take down individual tweets, rather than suspend entire accounts. A person familiar with Ms. McGowan’s account said her account had been frozen partly because of timing: The key decision makers at Twitter, based in San Francisco, were out of the office when the account was locked overnight. When the workday started, Twitter’s executives decided to lift the 12-hour freeze several hours early.
Ms. McGowan reached a $100,000 settlement with Mr. Weinstein in 1997 after a hotel room incident at the Sundance Film Festival, and in recent days has been vocal in her support of women who have stepped forward to reveal that the producer sexually harassed them or worse.
On Tuesday, after the actor Ben Affleck tweeted that the allegations against Mr. Weinstein “made him sick,” Ms. McGowan called him a liar, saying he had long been aware of what Mr. Weinstein had done. She has also attacked Hollywood players who failed to criticize Mr. Weinstein, writing in a tweet, “You all knew.”
Many Twitter users expressed outrage over the locking of Ms. McGowan’s account. The actress Jessica Chastain asked for clarification on which rules Ms. McGowan had violated, adding, “Asking for multiple victims of sexual violence.”
The actress Jamie Lee Curtis wrote: “And now THIS? You allow Twitter freedom to our president but you silence a woman speaking out about sexual harassment?”
Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, wrote that the company needed to be “a lot more transparent” to build trust.
Twitter has stated that tweets that are “newsworthy” remain on the site even if they violate its terms of service.

In recent months, many have asked why President Trump’s account hasn’t been suspended despite seeming to threaten other countries with violence. Threats of violence are not allowed on the platform, according to the Twitter Rules, a set of behavioral guidelines for users that include a prohibition against “harassment” and “hateful conduct.” The company wrote that Twitter would not suspend Mr. Trump in part because of “newsworthiness.”
Twitter has recently been under increased scrutiny after revelations that it allowed hundreds of Russian-linked accounts to flourish on the site. The Russian-linked accounts seemed intent on inciting partisan furor and electing Mr. Trump.
Twitter has long been criticized for taking too laissez-faire an approach to monitoring content that many of its users see to be in violation of the terms of service and Twitter rules. Some prominent users have claimed the site is a hostile space for women. The harassment campaign known as Gamergate flourished on the site for years, and when the company does suspend or ban an account it is often after immense pressure from users.
After Ms. McGowan’s Twitter account was unlocked on Thursday, she made it clear she was none too pleased with what had unfolded.
“When will nuclear war violate your terms of service?” she tweeted, pointing to Twitter’s statement about her situation."
Trump may trade Twitter spats for tax push ... for now,"Washington (CNN) In Washington, President Donald Trump is often his own worst enemy.
He rarely misses a chance to berate elite Republicans in Congress for failing to enact his ambitious agenda. Yet his tweeted tantrums and fierce character attacks -- often targeting his own team -- directly undermine his chances of building a Capitol Hill coalition to get things done.
On Wednesday, if he can avoid trampling over his own message as he so often does, Trump will try to ease that contradiction by using the power of the presidency in a unusually conventional way, to build support behind a top priority: tax reform.
After days flinging insults at GOP Sen. Bob Corker, sniping at his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and complaining about a bad rap from the press on his hurricane relief efforts, Trump plans to actually fixate on something that matters.
In an airport rally-style event near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the President will gather truckers and business leaders to highlight his vows to cut middle-class taxes, lift the corporate tax burden and to ignite soaring growth.
""When your trucks are moving, America is growing,"" Trump will tell supporters, according to a senior administration official. ""America first means putting American truckers first.""
Republicans want a win
The tax reform initiative is crucial for the President's hopes of finally notching a major legislative victory before the end of his first year in office. It means as much to Republicans who are desperate to show the spoils of their one-party rule in Washington to restive voters at the dawn of midterm election year.
But there is an even more significant dimension to the tax push since it may be the last chance for Trump and Republicans to find common cause and to bind the deep wounds left by their acrimonious failure to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Failing to secure reforms would be certain to drive an even deeper wedge between a President who vowed to drain the Washington swamp and establishment lawmakers who already fear assaults from Trump-style insurgents roared on by Steve Bannon in primary races next year.
Given the importance of the issue, it might have got more of Trump's attention. But he's spent much of his time recently pulling at the fractures in his own party and waging culture-war fights about patriotism and kneeling NFL players.
Since he launched the tax push in Indianapolis on September 27, Trump's cause has barely advanced. In fact, it may have slipped backwards.
The trip will be Trump's first chance to bring the symbolism of his office to bear since his showdown with the Tennessee senator, who warned that his unpredictable temperament could ignite World War III, earning in return a new nickname from Trump: ""Liddle' Bob Corker.""
The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2017
While the feud indulges Trump's relish for a fight, it could also be counterproductive, since the narrow nature of the GOP's Senate majority means he can hardly afford to lose any allies. Corker has already expressed concern about the tax reform bill, warning he may vote no if it adds to the deficit.
The Corker vs. Trump sideshow has dismayed many Republicans.
Other Republicans are warning that Trump's scatter-shot attacks on people he is relying on to support his priorities will cost him a chance to build the foundations of a successful presidency.
""If Donald Trump is fighting with Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell or now Bob Corker, he is taking his eye off the ball for tax reform,"" CNN contributor and Republican strategist Doug Heye said Tuesday.

'They're on another vacation right now'
It is clear that inside the White House, animosity toward Republican lawmakers runs deep, exemplifying the split between Trump, a Washington outsider, and those his allies see as establishment swamp creatures.
""(Trump is) calling on Congress to get their job done,"" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Tuesday.
""They're on another vacation right now, I think that we would all be a lot better off if the Senate would stop taking vacations, and start staying here until we actually get some real things accomplished.""
Trump is selling his tax plan as a ""middle class miracle"" that will include sweeping tax cuts, a simplification of the code and a chance to unleash unheard of rates of economic growth.
The plan calls for a corporate tax rate of no higher than 20% and hopes to lure corporations to repatriate profits earned abroad in a way that stems the flight of US blue collar jobs to low wage economies.
But Democrats have argued that the plan is no more than a massive giveaway to the richest Americans, including Trump himself, laying the groundwork for a political battle that will likely rage through the end of the year.
Given the delicate reality of pre-midterm election politics, it's not easy to assess the chances of the bill, especially given that tax reform is among the most complicated tasks that Congress ever faces. Most Republicans are itching to vote for tax cuts. But Corker is now a wild card. And Republican Sen. Susan Collins could announce a run for Maine governor this week, and could therefore shirk at voting for a bill branded as huge giveaway to the rich by Democrats.
But unlike in the Obamacare repeal effort, it's also possible that some Democrats running for re-election in red states won easily by Trump could defy their leaders and vote to gift the President a big win."
35 False Matches and 1 Erroneous Arrest As Police Secretly Test Facial Recognition Technology,"By Nicholas West
All things biometric are sweeping across the world at warp speed now, from security on planes and trains to check-ins at conferences and events, banking systems, etc. But the use of facial recognition tech in policing is being touted as the next big thing to keep the public safe. In fact, facial recognition technology is already working on the next level of development with researchers constructing new algorithms that supposedly can penetrate the most simple method of avoidance: wearing a mask.
However, a recent event in Britain should cause those who are high on this technology to rein in their enthusiasm. According to a Sky News report, a recent carnival in Notting Hill was treated as a testing ground for police facial recognition systems. The results were troubling.
The controversial trial of facial recognition equipment at Notting Hill Carnival resulted in roughly 35 false matches and an ‘erroneous arrest’ … The system only produced a single accurate match during the course of Carnival, but the individual had already been processed by the justice system between the time police compiled the suspect database and deployed it.
Firstly, the fact that the general public were used as guinea pigs by the police state when they were there to enjoy a celebratory event shows the level of disdain for basic civil liberties. Secondly, the fact that a test should result in actual questioning and detentions only doubles down on the violations to personal freedom. Lastly, one might wonder how any matches were made to begin with. Sky News reveals what we in the U.S. also have come to learn – the government has built a secret database (including innocent people) that’s just been waiting for the implementation of the recognition systems.
In the days before Carnival, Sky News revealed that police have more than 20 million facial recognition images on the British public, including hundreds of thousands on innocent people. There are a number of legal questions surrounding the police’s databases, especially following a High Court ruling in 2012 which said that the retention of those images was unlawful.
That ruling seems to matter little to the Metropolitan Police who clearly suggest that such trials will continue:
The Met said: “We have always maintained that it was a continued trial to test the technology and assess if it could assist police in identifying known offenders in large events, in order to protect the wider public.” “A full analysis of its deployments and a wider consultation will take place at the conclusion of the trial,” the spokesperson added, although no date was given for this. FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) Sky sources have suggested that the Met is planning to trial the technology at other events in the future.
This is the type of lawlessness that has now taken over law enforcement in an age where the public is just expected to endure a full loss of liberty in the name of security.

"A ""problem"" For The Wild Card Game & Sanchez...","A “problem” For The Wild Card Game & Sanchez…
(Before It's News)
(Sept. 13, 2017 – Source: Abbie Parr/Getty Images North America)
The media is looking for someone to blame for Thursday night’s loss to the Rays and they seem to have found it. It was days ago, and as the Yankees look toward their make it or break it game against the Twins on Tuesday the rumors are still out there. Fair or not, Gary Sanchez looks to be the scapegoat and some don’t want him behind the plate on Tuesday.
Sanchez has been scrutinized a lot this season for his defense and now suddenly when the Yankees need to focus on putting the best lineup on the field Tuesday there is growing support around media that Austin Romine should be the starting catcher that night. I like Romine, but do I want him catching and taking a DH spot away from another big hitter?

A wild pitch and a low ball that should have been caught but instead scooted underneath Sanchez’s glove are causing a lot of doubt in people’s minds. Both Newsday and the NY Daily News are rallying for Romine behind the plate and Sanchez as the DH.
Do I have confidence in Romine defensively? Sure, but I don’t have a lack of confidence in Sanchez either. No offense to Romine, he’s not the same hitter as some of the other guys on the team. Using him in this game means losing a more powerful bat which I am not confident in with a one game playoff spot.
Sanchez is a young kid. He’s had some mistakes and we’ve seen that but we have lived with his defensive blips all season long and still managed to get to the playoffs. I don’t think this is the time to be taking certain guys out of their element and putting them into a position they haven’t been playing consistently all season. Sanchez has a groove and maybe putting him at DH here isn’t the best way to tinker with the lineup here. Experimenting in a one chance game could be a costly mistake.
(Brad Penner/USA Today Sports)
I really want the best bats in the lineup. We have our best pitcher going and we need the best possible offense too so I don’t want to think about who has to sit out just so we can give our backup catcher a night to play. Who do you have sitting on the bench? Aaron Hicks? Todd Frazier? Matt Holliday? It doesn’t add up for me. We’ve had nothing but success so far against the Twins in the playoffs but now is not the time to sleep on them. This isn’t a guaranteed win and we need the best guys on the field.
Sanchez has been one of our best guys all season even with those mistakes. He’s earned his spot, and I know he is going to come out fighting that day. He’s hungry for this game just like the rest of our guys and all fans. I think the media is going a little overboard here. It’s do or die time and I am riding with my everyday catcher here so I hope Joe Girardi does too.

Seeing India Through a Contemporary Lens,"He took as much from the West as he did from traditional India. He was deeply versed in the devices of modernist photographers, especially Mr. Friedlander’s, in which foreground elements, such as poles and trees, and reflective surfaces, such as shop windows and plate-glass doorways, are employed to fragment the image and convey the jumbled sensations of life.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
In his street photography, though, there is a telling difference from the pictures of Mr. Winogrand or Robert Frank. The American photographers depicted crowds of atomized individuals. When Singh looked about him in India, he found intimate moments of human interaction — a boy carrying a baby, a barber cutting a client’s hair — within the wider flux of teeming humanity. “What was amazing in the last decade of Raghubir’s life was the modern vision he developed, with such a deep understanding of India, which was in his blood,” said Ketaki Sheth, one of the younger Indian photographers whom Singh mentored.
Sometimes, Singh’s photographs function as commentary. A picture taken outside the former Victoria Terminus in Mumbai (then Bombay) shows men in jeans and chinos hurrying to work, while in the foreground a vendor is holding a mosquito net that frames a view of its imposing stone lion. “To me, it is a complete sentence — all the men are in Western dress and they think they are catching the British lion in a mosquito net,” said Ilan Averbuch, a sculptor who was a close friend of Singh’s. A photograph of a wrecked truck and an oblivious cowherd recalls the Bruegel painting of the fall of Icarus, about which W. H. Auden wrote a famous poem; but unlike Bruegel’s disaster, which unfolds as a speck in the sky, Singh’s downed truck takes up more than a third of the frame, pushing up to the picture plane and dwarfing the man and his cattle. In India, catastrophe is always in your face, but it can be — must be — sidestepped.
In his final completed project, on the boxy Ambassador car that was ubiquitous during the period he traveled in India, the doors, windows and rearview mirrors of the vehicles divide and complicate the image. “His work became more abstract,” said Gwen Darien, an art historian and patient-rights advocate who was his partner during the last year of his life. At the time of his death, he was about to travel to Chicago, where his first American museum retrospective had just opened at the Art Institute of Chicago. “I think he was at a significant turning point,” Ms. Darien said. “It was a new place of his engagement with other photographers and the public. It is so heartbreaking that that was the moment when he died.”
One of his last, unfinished projects was a series of what we now call selfies in different settings. Mr. Roma said he thought these self-portraits differ in motivation from the well-known self-portraits of Mr. Friedlander (who is Mr. Roma’s father-in-law). “Lee is projecting himself on the landscape,” he said. “Raghubir was almost doing the opposite, projecting the landscape onto himself.” Singh was contemplating the impressions left on him by the many places he happened to visit, and the singular place from which he hailed. “He always claimed that he was shaped by Rajasthan,” said Akeel Bilgrami, a professor of philosophy at Columbia University. A 1998 self-portrait in Rajasthan illustrates that. Bespectacled and quizzical, Singh fills much of the frame, but he is out of focus. The courtyard and servant in the traditional house behind him are rendered sharp and clear."
How a businessman struck a deal with Islamic State to help Assad feed Syrians,"A woman pushes a cart loaded with a sack of wheat in Qamishli, Syria September 18, 2017. Picture taken September 18, 2017. REUTERS/Rodi Said
RAQQA/DUBAI (Reuters) - While Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was accusing the West of turning a blind eye to Islamic State smuggling, a member of his parliament was quietly doing business with the group, farmers and administrators in the militants’ former stronghold said.
The arrangement helped the Syrian government to feed areas still under its control after Islamic State took over the northeastern wheat-growing region during the six-year-old civil war, they said.
Traders working for businessman and lawmaker Hossam al-Katerji bought wheat from farmers in Islamic State areas and transported it to Damascus, allowing the group to take a cut, five farmers and two administrators in Raqqa province told Reuters.
Katerji’s office manager, Mohammed Kassab, confirmed that Katerji Group was providing Syrian government territories with wheat from the northeast of Syria through Islamic State territory but denied any contact with Islamic State. It is not clear how much Assad knew of the wheat trading.
Cooperation over wheat between a figure from Syria’s establishment, which is backed by Shi‘ite power Iran, and the hardline Sunni Islamic State would mark a new ironic twist in a war that has deepened regional Sunni-Shi‘ite divisions.
Reuters contacted Katerji’s office six times to request comment but was not given access to him.
His office manager Kassab, asked how the company managed to buy and transport the wheat without any contact with Islamic State, said: “It was not easy, the situation was very difficult.” When asked for details he said only that it was a long explanation. He did not return further calls or messages.
Damascus, under U.S. and EU sanctions over the conflict and alleged oil trading with Islamic State, strongly denies any business links with the hardline Islamist militants, arguing that the United States is responsible for their rise to power.
The self-declared caliphate they set up across large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014 has all but collapsed after Western-backed forces drove them out of their Iraqi stronghold, Mosul and surrounded them in Raqqa, where they are now confined to a small area.
Russian and Iranian-backed Syrian forces are attacking them elsewhere, such as Deir al Zor on Syria’s eastern border, where Kassab says he was speaking from, in a continuing struggle for the upper hand between world powers.
TWENTY PERCENT
Five farmers in Raqqa described how they sold wheat to Katerji’s traders during Islamic State rule in interviews at the building housing the Raqqa Civil Council, formed to take over once the city is retaken.
“The operation was organized,” said Mahmoud al-Hadi, who owns agricultural land near Raqqa and who, like the other farmers, had come to the council’s cement offices to seek help.
“I would sell to small traders who sent the wheat to big traders who sent it on to Katerji and the regime through two or three traders,” he said.
He and the other farmers said they all had to pay Islamic State a 10 percent tax, or zakat, and sold all of their season’s supplies to Katerji’s traders under the multi-layered scheme.
Local officials said Katerji’s traders bought up wheat from Raqqa and Deir al-Zor and gave Islamic State 20 percent.
“If a truck is carrying 100 sacks, they (Islamic State) would keep 20 and give the rest to the trucker,” said Awas Ali, a deputy of the Tabqa joint leadership council, a similar, post-Islamic State local body allied to the Kurdish-led forces now attacking Raqqa.
Ali said he learned of the details of the arrangement with Katerji by speaking with Islamic State prisoners and others who worked in the group’s tax collection and road tolling systems.
“Katerji’s trucks were well known and the logo on them was clear and they were not harassed at all,” Ali said, adding that Katerji’s people were active during the last buying season, which lasts from May to August. The farmers also said the trucks were identifiable as Katerji‘s.
The truck drivers were even allowed to smoke cigarettes as they passed through the checkpoints, something Islamic State enforcers punished with whippings elsewhere, Ali and several other sources said.
“I would sell an entire season’s supplies to Katerji’s traders,” said farmer Ali Shanaan.
“They are known traders. The checkpoints stopped the trucks and Daesh would take a cut and let them pass,” he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
The wheat was transported via the “New bridge” over the Euphrates River to a road leading out of Raqqa, the farmers and local officials said. Control of the bridge is now unclear as the militants in Raqqa come close to defeat.
Raqqa-based lawyer Abdullah al-Aryan, who said he had been a consultant for some of Katerji’s traders, said Katerji’s trucks brought goods into Islamic State territory as well as wheat out.

“Food used to come from areas controlled by the government. Medicine and food,” he said.
Islamic State rule involved shooting or beheading perceived opponents in public squares, imposing its own extreme version of sharia, Islamic law, and then providing basic goods such as bread and setting up ministries and taxation.
Several farmers said they saw Islamic State documents which were stamped at checkpoints to allow the wheat trucks to pass. They belonged to the department which imposes taxes.
SMUGGLING
Islamic State may have exported some of the wheat. Local officials and farmers said the militants, as well as a rebel group, had sold the contents of grain silos in the northeast to traders across the Turkish border.
Assad has accused his enemies, including Turkey and Western countries, of supporting the group, something they deny.
In an interview in March with a Chinese news agency, published by Syrian state news agency SANA, Assad said:
“As for the other side, which is the United States, at least during the Obama administration, it dealt with Daesh through overlooking its smuggling of Syrian oil to Turkey, and in that way Daesh was able to procure money in order to recruit terrorists from all over the world.”
Slideshow (4 Images)
Asked whether Syrian companies were dealing with Islamic State to secure wheat, Internal Trade and Consumer Protection Minister Abdullah al-Gharbi said in August: “No, not at all.”
Speaking to Reuters at a Damascus trade fair, he added: “This doesn’t exist at all. We are importing wheat from Russian companies in addition to our local crop and this talk is completely unacceptable.”
The wheat buying season ended in August and IS has lost control of the wheat-growing areas, either to government forces or the Syrian Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces.
THE ONASSIS OF SYRIA
Assad has traditionally relied on a close-knit set of businessmen most notably Rami Makhlouf, his maternal cousin, to help keep Syria’s economy afloat.
Makhlouf is subject to international sanctions and relies on various associates to do business.
Katerji is a household name around Raqqa and elsewhere. Farmer Hadi likened him to a late Greek shipping tycoon, Aristotle Onassis. “Katerji is the Onassis of Syria,” he said.
Katerji’s facebook profile page shows him shaking hands with Assad and he regularly posts pictures of the president, who he describes as “a beacon of light for pan-Arabism, patriotism and loyalty”.
He is member of parliament for Aleppo, a key battleground recovered by the government late last year, and is part of a new business class that has risen to prominence during the war.
The United States and EU have imposed a range of measures targeted both at the government and some of the many armed groups operating in Syria, but foodstuffs are not restricted.
U.S. and European sanctions on banking and asset freezes have, however, made it difficult for most trading houses to do business with Assad’s government and made local supplies increasingly vital.
Flat bread is a subsidized staple for Syrians, who have suffered under a conflict estimated to have killed several hundred thousand people and forced millions to flee their homes.
The government needs around 1.5 million tonnes annually to feed the areas it controls and keep Syrians on Assad’s side.
Syria’s bread-basket provinces of Hasaka, Raqqa and Deir al-Zor account for nearly 70 percent of total wheat production.
While the government looks set to retake much of Deir al-Zor province soon, Hasaka is mostly under the control of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, who are also likely to hold sway in Raqqa along with Arab allied groups.
Ali, from the Tabqa council, predicted that would not stop the wheat trade. “People like Katerji, with a lot of money and power, their activities will never be completely frozen,” he said. “It is just going to disappear from one area and go to another.”"

Weinstein Co board ousts Harvey Weinstein after harassment allegations,"(Reuters) - The Weinstein Co has fired co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein, effective immediately, following reports of sexual harassment allegations against the executive, who was one of Hollywood’s biggest power brokers, the film production company said on Sunday.
The departure leaves Weinstein’s brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser at the helm of the company.
The board of directors made the decision “in light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding that he had been notified.
A spokeswoman for the executive did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company said on Friday that Weinstein, 65, was taking an indefinite leave of absence after the New York Times reported that he had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.
Weinstein has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign.
The company also said it was conducting its own internal investigation."
5 Things to Think About,"By Tony Cartalucci
Headlines and commentary across both Eastern and Western media have mainly focused on the Catalan independence referendum and the actions of Spanish police and the Spanish government’s attempts to disrupt polls.
However, little is being said about what the real implications of Catalan independence may be. What do those politicians in Catalonia in favor of independence seek to do with it should they succeed? Will they create a Catalonia that serves the best interests of the people? Or serve the EU and NATO more efficiently and eagerly than a united Spain ever could?
There are 5 points those following this conflict should know and keep in mind as events unfold:
1. Catalonia has a formidable industrialized economy relative to other regions of Spain, with a GDP and population just exceeding those of nations like Scotland or Singapore, and likely could achieve and sustain independence from Spain.
2. NATO appears eager to encourage independence and would welcome what they expect to be a robust military capability to add to their wars of global aggression.
An article published in 2014 by the Atlantic Council – a Fortune 500-funded NATO think tank – titled, “The Military Implications of Scottish and Catalonian Secession,” would state:
Catalonia has 7.3 million people, with more than $300 billion in GDP. Spending just 1.6% of that on defense provides over $4.5 billion annually, or roughly the budget of Denmark, which has well-regarded and efficient armed forces. Catalonian military plans are more vague, but so far, they emphasize the navy. With excellent ports in Barcelona and Tarragona, Catalonia is well-positioned as a minor naval power, ‘with the Mediterranean as our strategic environment, and NATO as our framework’, as the nationalists’ think-tank on defense argues. The rough plans call for a littoral security group of a few hundred sailors at first. After a few years, Catalonia would assume responsibility as “a main actor in the Mediterranean,” with land-based maritime patrol aircraft and small surface combatants. Eventually, the nationalist ambition may include an expeditionary group with a light assault carrier and hundreds of marines, to take a serious role in collective security.
The Atlantic Council piece would emphatically conclude that:
If accurately characterized by the few white papers that have surfaced, the separatists’ position suggests a valuable and refreshing view of specialization in collective defense: build a navy that is comparatively focused on influencing events ashore.
3. Pro-independence Catalan politicians appear to enthusiastically support Catalonia’s membership in NATO.
…when the next Afghanistan comes, Catalan blood will also be spilled.
A 2014 article titled, “Catalan PM confirms NATO membership, commitment to collective security,” stated:
Prime Minister Artur Mas explicitly confirmed Catalonia is seeking NATO membership. In a recent interview with the Italian daily La Reppublica, Catalan Prime Minister Artur Mas explained that an independent Catalonia sees herself at the heart of NATO. This is in line with Catalonia’s commitment to the international community, the principle of collective security, international law, and the rule of law at sea.
The article also claims:
Catalonia seeks freedom, not to avoid the inescapable responsibilities that come hand in hand with it, but to fully exercise them side by side with partners and allies. Catalans understand fully that freedom never comes without cost, and that whereas independence means government of the people, by the people, and for the people, instead of alien rule, it also means that they will not be able to look the other way when a crisis or challenge arises. They understand that when the next Afghanistan comes, Catalan blood will also be spilled.
In essence, Catalan politicians appear eagerly committed not only to NATO, but to the foreign wars of aggression it wages, and spilling the blood of its people to help NATO fight them.
4. Some Catalan politicians have begun planning for its military’s integration into NATO.
The pro-independence Catalan National Assembly’s Defense Policy Working Group has stated in a 2014 paper titled, “Dimensions of the Catalan Defence Forces: Naval Forces (Executive Summary),” that:
The Mediterranean: our strategic environment. NATO: our framework Catalonia must participate in SNMG2 (Standing NATO Maritime Group 2; formerly Standing Naval Force Mediterranean), a component of the NRF (NATO Response Force). It would also be convenient to participate in the SNMCMG2 (Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 2).
5. Like “Kurdistan,” any sort of “independence” is meaningless if the resulting state finds itself utterly dependent and entwined with Western hegemony and the institutions that maintain it – especially at the cost of member states and proxies – be they Kurdish or Catalan.
That Catalonia’s politicians have already openly and eagerly pledged Catalan blood and treasure to foreign interests and the wars they seek to fight across the globe, suggests that the notion of Catalonia actually achieving any sort of “independence” is actually Catalonia simply becoming more dependent on an even greater master, and one even further abroad.
Further Thoughts
These 5 points should be considered by those for and against Catalan independence. While Catalonia could create for itself a lasting and meaningful independence underpinned by peace and prosperity for its people, it appears that many in senior leadership positions intend to simply shift Catalonia’s subservience from Madrid to Brussels.
Further questions regarding Catalonia’s economy remain – including what an independent Catalonia might do to help feed larger, foreign corporations who may seek to circumvent barriers and obstacles in Spain’s current economic climate, and exploit an “independent” Catalonia, its people, markets, and resources. Unfortunately, such economic policies and their fallout may unfold long after it is possible for the people of Catalonia to do anything about it.
For the Catalan people dedicated to independence, they must find and use the local, socioeconomic leverage necessary to direct their potentially independent nation toward a trajectory that best serves them and their future – not a handful of Catalan politicians eagerly serving interests in Brussels, London, or Washington.

Brazil's congress sets up fund to cover lack of campaign finance,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s scandal-plagued political class voted on Wednesday to set up a 1.7 billion reais ($542 million) fund with taxpayer money to finance election campaigns, making up for a dearth of private funding ahead of next year’s general election.
A ban on corporate donations coupled with the drying up of under-the-table contributions and kickbacks in the wake of the country’s biggest corruption scandal have left lawmakers struggling to raise campaign funding.
The lower house of Congress approved a bill that had passed the Senate and will take funds from pork barrel appropriations and government payments to buy TV and radio time for parties.
The fund was meant to be part of improvements to Brazil’s discredited political system to reduce a proliferation of parties that has made it hard to govern Latin America’s largest nation without unwieldy coalitions based on self-interest.
The Senate unanimously approved on Tuesday a constitutional amendment that limits coalitions to parties with similar platforms, but it will not go into effect until the 2022 elections.
More than 100 lawmakers are targeted by the Car Wash corruption investigation that uncovered a network of bribes from private companies seeking to win contracts or influence policies, and even implicated President Michel Temer and several of his cabinet ministers.
Critics of the campaign fund said it was aimed at providing funding for lawmakers seeking re-election to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption.
“It is shameful that this fund will be used by unethical politicians who should not be sitting here in Congress,” said Julio Delgado, leader of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB). “Not a single lawmaker under investigation has opposed it.”
Backers of the use of public money for campaigns argued that organized crime would step in to finance politicians if funding was lacking.
The sprawling Car Wash graft investigation that convicted dozens of executives from Brazil’s main contractor companies has shut down the flow of undeclared payments to politicians.
“What most worries them is where they will get money for their campaigns now that companies cannot donate and are not willing to engage in illegal contributions,” said Lucas de Aragão, partner at political risk consultancy Arko Advice.
On the positive side, he said, Congress set a threshold for parties to be able to access public funding and free TV time based on the votes they win, which will help reduce the number of parties, today totaling 35.
(This version of the story corrects the fifth paragraph to say coalitions reform will not go into effect until the 2022 elections)."
Coaching Staff Failing Ravens,"Coaching Staff Failing Ravens

(Before It's News)
First Quarter Status Report
Remember when you were in grade school and you got “progress reports?” They weren’t report cards, so the letter grades weren’t written in ink (so to speak). But if you were trending in that D or F direction, this was a wake-up call to get your sh…. together.
Well four games into the season, the Ravens are trending in the “not passing” direction.
Yes, the team is 2-2, but they seem miles away from that team that was driving for a TD score before the end of the first half against Cleveland.
We all know the story by now: the potential nails in the coffin could have been losing Marshal Yanda and Brandon Williams against the Browns, and Brent Urban against the Jaguars. And that could very well be all there is to this team’s putrid play the rest of the way against the Jaguars, and in Week 4 against Steelers.
However, there are other teams finding ways to win without having their best out there – see Kansas City and Green Bay. Coaching can mask some of the personnel issues that creep up. For example, with both of their starting offensive tackles out, the Green Bay coaches shortened Aaron Rodgers‘ drop steps, used more read/pass options (RPOs) to get the ball out quick, and used chips to slow down the outside rushers they’ve faced.
The Ravens could have easily lost to Jacksonville and Pittsburgh with Yanda, Williams, and Urban. But to get embarrassed and lose by a combined score of 70-16?
Nope, that’s where coaching has to be called into question.
This passing game is designed the same way as last year. We still see two and three-yard completions in third-and-long situations. We still see empty formations when the offense needs two or three yards to get a first down in a third-and-short. We still no use of trips, stacks, or bunches – anything to create unbalanced looks to create one-on-one mismatch opportunities against a defense. I’ve been asking for these formations for years in my Battle Plans articles, as I see how well they work around the league. Alas, they remain nowhere to be found in Baltimore.
I get it: Marty Mornhinweg has very little to work with from a talent standpoint. The cupboard which was bare coming into the season got smashed into pieces when offensive linemen started dropping like flies. That’s no excuse for not at least attempting some different schematic approaches at the very least. (By the way, I’m not holding my breath that anything will change.)
On defense, injuries to the front seven can be an excuse when you haven’t invested so heavily in that front seven. This group needs to be more consistent, period. They’ve been shoved around the past two games.
Another observation over the first four games is that safety Tony Jefferson doesn’t look like a good fit in this defense. Is it really that much of a surprise considering this is a Dean Pees defense? Jefferson thrived in Arizona when he was in attack mode, playing a glorified linebacker role. He was used on third-down blitzes, he was a key cog in the run game.
So far, he’s been underwhelming as a tackler and as an intimidator. In coverage, he’s been lost in space.
Here’s a thought: Maybe Pees can experiment with Jefferson as a primary box defender against Oakland on early downs this coming Sunday. Play more Cover One with Eric Weddle as the centerfielder. Get Jefferson going as an attacker again because right now, he’s not living up to his $34 million price tag.
It’s just the latest example of the coaching staff failing to properly utilize the talent the front office provides them.
What Needs to Improve
Where to begin? There’s no way we can cover it all in this short article, but let’s scrape the surface.
For starters, the Ravens need to get back to basics and continue to build off their ground attack. There’s still some promise with this run game. Some of the plays and designs that Greg Roman has brought to the table have hit the mark in the first quarter of the season.
In particular, the misdirection sweeps from shotgun have been highly effective. If Alex Collins can stop putting the ball on the ground (which to this point, there’s no reason to think will happen), these plays have the juice to be home run hitters.
In an offense this anemic, they need to keep going to that well.
Defensively, Pees needs to let the young guys play. More Tim Williams. More Tyus Bowser. Start Patrick Onwuasor over Kamalei Correa.
Will they make mistakes? Sure, but what’s the point of less talented players seeing the field and making the same mistakes?
There’s a lot more ground to cover, but this is a start.
We’ve got three more progress reports to go this season. Here’s to the mid-point progress report showing some actual, you know…progress.

"U.S. Suspends Visa Services in Turkey, and Turkey Responds in Kind","ISTANBUL — The United States said on Sunday that it was suspending nonimmigrant visa services at its diplomatic facilities in Turkey after the arrest of a consulate employee, prompting Turkey to halt visa services in America.
The United States Embassy in Ankara, the Turkish capital, issued a statement from the United States Mission to Turkey saying that recent events had forced it to “reassess the commitment of the government of Turkey to the security of U.S. Mission facilities and personnel.”
The Turkish Embassy in Washington responded with a similar statement late Sunday, saying it would “reassess the commitment of the government of the United States to the security of Turkish mission facilities and personnel.” It said the measures would apply to e-Visas, visas issued at borders and visas in passports.
Last week, the Turkish authorities arrested a United States Consulate employee of Turkish nationality over alleged links to the network of the United States-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the Turkish government blames for last summer’s failed coup. Mr. Gulen denies involvement. The employee, Metin Topuz, is accused of espionage and “attempting to overthrow the Turkish government and constitution.”

Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency reported that he was accused of communicating with former police chiefs in a 2013 corruption inquiry, 121 people involved in the attempted coup and hundreds of people using an encrypted mobile messaging app. The United States Embassy said it was “deeply disturbed” by the arrest.

The American statement said the suspension of nonimmigrant visa services was “effective immediately” to minimize visitor numbers to the United States Embassy and Consulate for now. The suspended services will affect visas for business people, tourists, medical patients, students, journalists and treaty trader, as well as diplomatic and official visas.
Relations between Turkey and the United States have been tense over disagreements about Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the United States backs in the war against the Islamic State. Turkey considers them a terrorist group and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which has waged an insurgency within Turkey for more than 30 years."

"In Jerusalem, Looking for Peace in Backgammon and Music","Still, after years of impasse in the peace process, a growing number of Israelis and Palestinians seem to be searching for creative ways to bypass politics, reaching across the divide to find professional peers, new resources and receptive audiences. And a number of recent events have sought to provide a common language for Israelis and Palestinians here.
Photo
On Sunday, thousands of supporters of Women Wage Peace, a Jewish-Arab movement established after the Gaza war of 2014, converged, first in a reconciliation tent in the desert near Jericho in the West Bank, and then at a rally in Jerusalem. And a website, 0202, named for Jerusalem’s 02 telephone area code, translates local news into Hebrew and Arabic.
Riman Barakat, an East Jerusalem-born Palestinian peace activist, is involved in both the Mekudeshet festival and Women Wage Peace. “You may think I’m naïve,” she told a group of Israelis on a recent tour of the seam between East and West Jerusalem, “but there can’t be any other way for me.”
Given the history, organizing anything in this city is a complicated, risky business, particularly if it involves both Israelis from the predominantly Jewish west side and Palestinians from the east, which Israel annexed in a move that was never internationally recognized.
“We understand it’s a risk, and that’s the inspiration,” said Karen Brunwasser, the deputy director of Mekudeshet, adding, “It’s all about showing people, even Jerusalemites, what they have not yet seen.”
The festival producers were in the midst of selling tickets when Israel unilaterally placed metal detectors around the Aqsa Mosque compound, a contested and volatile holy site, after a shooting attack that killed two police officers.
“People were phoning the box office saying they wanted to book, but is it safe?” Ms. Brunwasser said. “These are the liabilities of living in and producing a festival in Jerusalem. But when it works it’s the most extraordinary thing.”

The Kulna concert brought together an eclectic cast of artists. The king of Palestinian rap from the Shuafat refugee camp in northeast Jerusalem teamed up with a Tel Aviv poet of Yemeni descent known as the angry voice of Israel’s Mizrahim, or Jews who hail from North Africa and the Middle East.

An Armenian from Jerusalem’s Old City sang duets with a soulful Arab Israeli singer, and Jews sang in Hebrew and Arabic. An after-party at a club in West Jerusalem featured Palestinian hip-hop artists from East Jerusalem and, in what was probably a first, fellow rappers from Ramallah, Jericho and Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
One factor contributing to the new collaboration is the so-called Mizrahi awakening of a younger generation connecting with its Arab cultural roots.
The after-party was organized by the Jerusalem disc jockey Ram Spinoza, a.k.a. DJ Ramzy, whose grandmother came from Syria, and who specializes in contemporary Middle Eastern music. Mr. Spinoza, who served in the Israeli Air Force, regularly holds his signature “Monolingua” parties in West Jerusalem’s alternative music venues, letting the music do the talking.

“I stopped hoping for a peace agreement,” Mr. Spinoza said in an interview, “so I do it my own way — I live the peace.” Of the more traditional methods of fostering coexistence in the city, he added: “Dialogue groups are not the best fun. This is fun.”
Mr. Spinoza often hosts Palestinian rappers like the duo Muzi Raps, from the Old City, and Raed Bassem Jabid, from the Palestinian neighborhood of At-Tur on the Mount of Olives. “If you’re looking for peace,” Mr. Jabid said, “you’ll find the peace.”
Even in peacetime, though, attempts to escape politics can be viewed as political. Many Palestinians, for instance, reject what they call cultural normalization with the Israelis.
The Jerusalem-Armenian musician, Apo Sahagian, whose guitar was recently held by the Israeli airport authorities for extra security screening, appeared to be grappling with those sensitivities.
Photo
On the day of the Kulna concert, a post appeared on the Facebook page of Apo & the Apostles, Mr. Sahagian’s band, denying rumors that it was scheduled to perform in Jerusalem. The band, most of whose members come from Bethlehem, in the West Bank, declined to comment and the post appears to have been taken down.

The backgammon tournament did break down a few barriers. The idea came about when a group of Israeli and Palestinian activists took a break from a tense brainstorming session and looked for an activity that would let people engage with one another. They ended up playing backgammon.
Karem Jubran, a Palestinian from the Shuafat camp, said his friends came to the tournament for “the love of the game.”
A youth from the camp, Abdullah Jubran, 16, said he had taught himself to play by watching YouTube and hoped to win the 25,000 shekel (almost $7,000) prize. He was knocked out of the competition early, though a friend of his father reached the finals.
Hundreds of players faced off across rows of tables in qualifying rounds in the Armenian and Jewish quarters of the Old City and on the grassy verge outside the Damascus Gate to the Muslim quarter, the scene of numerous attacks in the past two years.
Zaki Djemal, an Israeli of Syrian descent and a founder of the tournament, acknowledged that many of the Israeli players assigned to the Damascus Gate area were frightened and asked to be moved.
But Mr. Djemal said he was not nervous. “It’s a state of mind,” he said."
Belinda Carlisle: Still in Heaven?,"Image copyright Sheila Rock Image caption The star is celebrating the 30th anniversary of her breakthrough album, Heaven On Earth
""I have an original voice,"" says Belinda Carlisle,
""It may not be the best voice but it's distinct and I think that's what has carried me through the years.""
She's being modest, of course. Without that foundation-quaking vibrato, there would be no Heaven Is A Place On Earth, no Circle In The Sand and no Summer Rain.
And then there's her catalogue with The Go-Go's, the new wave girl band she formed in her teens. Hits like We Got The Beat and Our Lips Are Sealed sent their debut album to number one in America.
To this day, Beauty and the Beat is still the only US chart-topper to be written and played by women.
But through all of that success, Carlisle was harbouring a severe cocaine habit. Even fellow party animal Rod Stewart was shocked, writing in his autobiography that Carlisle ""could snort the lacquer off a table"".
After two decades, though, the singer finally got clean after hearing a voice telling her: ""You are going to be found dead in a hotel if you don't stop.""
That was in 2005. Now, aged 59, she's releasing her first album in a decade, Wilder Shores, which is built around the Kundalini yoga chants that helped her recovery.
On the phone from Brighton, she told the BBC about that record, the 30th anniversary of the Heaven On Earth album and what it's like to be covered in spit at a punk show.
Image copyright Lisa Borgnes Giamonti Image caption Carlisle now lives in France, and practises yoga every day
Hi, Belinda! How's Brighton?
I love Brighton! I've been coming here since the late 70s when it was just one fish-and-chip shop on the sea front.
That would have been when The Go-Go's supported Madness on tour?
Yes, exactly. It was my second trip to the UK - I think I was probably 19 and we opened for Madness on their tour, and it was mostly seaside towns.
What were the audiences like at those gigs?
Oh my God! Back then, the whole National Front thing was unfortunately involved with the ska movement - so there were lots of tattooed skinheads, and one of the things they would do is, if they liked you, they would gob on you. So we would be coming off stage covered in spit.
We were just five girls from Southern California, so it was really scary. There were a lot of tears. But overall, even though we had no money and were covered in spit, we still had a good time.
Image copyright Rex / Shutterstock Image caption The Go-Go's in 1983: Charlotte Caffey, Belinda Carlisle, Gina Schock, Kathy Valentine, Jane Wiedlin
I'm always amazed that The Go-Go's are still the only all-female band to have written a number one album. It's like you battered down the door and no-one else came through.
I don't know… I guess the Bangles came close.
But they used a lot of co-writers..
Yeah, they did. Go figure. You'd think there would be more after us, but there weren't. I don't understand that at all.
You can still see your legacy in other bands, like Haim or Hole or L7. It's just a shame no-one else has replicated the success.
Well, I mean, good luck now, unless you're put together by a svengali. Something like The Go-Gos could never happen now. It was too authentic. And authenticity is really lacking in music.
Image copyright ITV / Rex / Shutterstock Image caption The star scored five top 10 albums in the UK between 1987 and 1993
Was there a backlash when you went from punk-inspired sound of The Go-Gos to the pure pop of Heaven On Earth?
Oh, I think so - and I can see why. But everything I've ever done has been true to myself. The albums Heaven On Earth and Runaway Horses and Live Your Life Be Free were harking back to when I was a young girl and listening to Californian radio - lush productions, complicated melodies, harmonies like the Beach Boys and the Mamas and Papas. That's what those albums remind me of.
So they're all very dear to my heart. Except A Woman and a Man [Belinda's sixth album, released in 1996].
But even on that record you got to work with Brian Wilson.
Well, gosh, that was one of the highlights - but, you know, at that point I was in a lot of personal turmoil… I guess there were a few good songs in there and California was one of them. Having Brian Wilson sing on my album was an unforgettable experience.
What do you recall of making the Heaven On Earth album?
I'll never forget the first time I heard Circle In The Sand; or I Get Weak, which [songwriter] Dianne Warren played on the piano and sang for me. I actually told her she should release it, because she has a great voice. And then hearing Heaven for the first time, I realised, and I think we all realised, that it had the potential to be a global hit.
Which songs have you enjoyed revisiting on the tour?
Should I Let You In - I'd totally forgotten about that one. And Fool For Love, which I started working into my set this last summer, people love it! It's just such a fun, powerful, pop song.
Image copyright Virgin Image caption Heaven On Earth produced five hit singles in the UK
You don't have any writing credits on Heaven On Earth but by your fifth album, Real, you were contributing to almost every song. What changed?
For the first three albums, pretty much, I was just a voice - and I mean that in the best possible way. But on Real, I felt I needed to make a change.
I've always known I could write. I have an ear for production and melody. It was just that in those early years, I let everyone do it for me. To be honest, I was a little lazy!
Listening to Real now, it was ahead of its time, insofar as its sound and incorporating loops. And right after that, Alanis Morrisette came out with Jagged Little Pill, which had a similar approach. I mean, I'm not claiming that - there's not an original thought out there. It just happened to be a little ahead of its time.
Fast-forward to 2017, and you've just performed a concert at a yoga class...
That was really good fun. The yoga audience was pretty new for me, but what was funny was seeing fans who'd never done yoga before coming in with their mats and experiencing the mantra and singing along with it.
How did you end up making an album of chants?
I started chanting before I got sober, and chanting is really interesting, because it's a science and it definitely works.
Way back at the beginning… I had made so many messes in my life and it had all come to a head. It would have been very easy for me to jump off a cliff but because of all the chanting I was doing, I was flying high. It was like a feeling of elation at the very beginning of my sobriety. It was very strange, so I know it's power.
Then I started experimenting with repetitive mantra in a pop song format. And I think it works. And that's how you get Wilder Shores.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Go-Go's have reformed several times, and performed at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards
Which of the mantras on the album has been the most useful to you personally?
Ek Ong Kar Sat Gur Prasad [roughly translated as, ""There is one creator of all creation. All is a blessing of the one creator""]. It's one that, simply put, makes me feel pretty happy, instantaneously.
Could you have got sober without it?
Oh I probably could have, but there's no question that it made my transition into sobriety easier, no question.
Will you be singing the mantras on tour?
I do one chant at the very, very end of the show [but] it doesn't really work in the context of a full-on rock concert. The focus is really on the Heaven On Earth album.
Your voice sounds stronger than ever on the record. What do you put that down to?
Well, I always say it was 30 years of booze and cigarettes!
Belinda Carlisle's new album, Wilder Shores, is out now; as is a three-disc anniversary edition of Heaven On Earth. She is currently on tour in the UK.

(Before It's News)
Crunch time begins now for fantasy owners everywhere as we have reached the dreaded bye weeks. The real ones — not those makeshift disasters that may or may not have put Tampa and Miami at disadvantages for the remainder of the season. But I digress… Week 4 provided another laundry list of unexpected results across the league both in game scores and fantasy outputs, so where does that leave us this season in terms of thinking we have a good grip on how Week 5 will go? We have no clue, but here’s some rankings anyway! Quarterback By all accounts, Thursday night is shaping up to be an all out points extravaganza between New England and Tampa Bay placing both Brady and Winston in this week’s top 3 plays. How bad has New England’s defense been this year? 27th in pass rush and their shiny new toy in Stephon Gilmore has not been as advertised. Deshaun Watson makes the biggest jump of the group and is starting to look like the real deal. Hard to imagine DeAndre Hopkins isn’t loving his new quarterback by now. I like Philip Rivers this week to get the Chargers into the win column for the first time this season, but past that there aren’t a lot of deep sleeper options compared to last week’s crop.

Running Back
The top three for Week 5 are a wash for me. Each option should put up a solid game as it looks like Bell has finally shaken off the rust after his pre-season holdout. Gurley and Fournette are iffy options for me this week, but because of the talent, you can’t disregard what they could bring to the table. Fournette is starting to give me some cause for concern as his snap count has decreased each week this season as last week he was only on the field for half of Jacksonville’s snaps. Doug Martin comes back this week following his three game suspension and falls in the 20s among a tangled mess of options including Latavius Murray’s shot to rule the Vikings’ backfield. This also may be the week Wayne Gallman overtakes the Giants’ backfield after unimpressive starts by both Paul Perkins and Orleans Darkwa. Oh, and one more sub-3 YPC game from Isaiah Crowell this week and he’s a dump option across all leagues for me. All hail Duke Johnson.

Wide Receiver Came close to placing Brown lower on the list as Jacksonville’s secondary has been lights out against WR1?s this year. Still a risky play regardless. The matchups throughout the top 10 provide plenty of intrigue and are favorable for the most part. Meanwhile into the teens we find Chris Hogan who continues to thrive following the injury to Julian Edelman. It comes as somewhat of a shock to me that he is THIS good. It should continue on Thursday night. Will Fuller’s chemistry was on point with Deshaun Watson last week against Tennessee, and with a challenging matchup against Kansas City this week, it should be interesting to see if he can build off the four reception season debut.

Doctor Who: Tom Baker finishes abandoned 1979 Shada serial,"Image copyright BBC Worldwide Image caption Missing parts of Shada have been animated
Doctor Who star Tom Baker has returned to complete an unfinished story 36 years after it was abandoned.
Shada, which was filmed in Cambridge, was created in 1979 for the end of the show's 17th series.
But strike action at the BBC meant studio scenes were never completed and the episodes were abandoned.
It will be released on BBC Worldwide with the original footage combined with new colour animations and voiceovers to complete the story.
The newly-recorded lines from Baker as the Doctor and Lalla Ward as his companion, Romana, will follow the original script by Douglas Adams, the creator of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Image caption Actor Tom Baker said Shada was one of his favourite episodes
The story finds the Doctor in Cambridge working alongside Romana and a retired Time Lord, Professor Chronotis, to defeat the evil alien Skagra who is attempting to steal the secrets to the prison planet, Shada.
Image caption The story finds the Doctor in Cambridge working alongside Romana and retired Time Lord, Professor Chronotis
Baker said: ""Shada was one of my favourite Doctor Who stories.
""I have many fond memories of shooting the location scenes in Cambridge, and it was disappointing not to finish the story in studio. I'm so glad that BBC Worldwide have found a way to bring fans a complete visual version.""
Image caption The episode includes the robot dog K-9 and Romana played by Lalla Ward
The release of Shada follows the animation of lost 1966 Doctor Who story The Power Of The Daleks in November 2016.
Footage from Shada was used in the Doctor Who 20th anniversary special, The Five Doctors, which re-united the Time Lord's past incarnations.
Tom Baker did not want to reprise his role as the Fourth Doctor for the story so a scene from Shada was used and the character was said to have been trapped in the time vortex.
For the show's 40th anniversary in 2003 the Eighth Doctor, Paul McGann, joined Lalla Ward for a new version of Shada in an animated webcast on the BBC website.
Shada will be released as a digital download on 24 November and on DVD and Bluray on 4 December."

Maybe I don’t know because, according to social justice warriors, I am a white, racist, bigot, but could someone tell me where the oppression is that’s central to the NFL anthem protests? If they are talking about black people being shot by cops, I have a message to the black leaders out there: discourage gang culture, crime, and disrespect of authority and maybe they won’t get shot by police. When you have a group of people who represent 12% of the population committing over 52% of the crimes in this country, the fault is in the black community.
This is 2017, not 1917, all this kneeling during the National Anthem is a load of crap and accomplishes nothing. Someone is going to have to explain to me how disrespecting our country and our flag are going to stop black men from getting shot? If you ask me the only thing that it does is strike more of a division between blacks and whites.
Does it not seem strange that the people who are saying that black people are oppressed are probably some of the richest black men in the country, which only proves that America is the land of opportunity, not the land of oppression. You will never convince me that all black people are oppressed in this country.
Blacks need to focus on who is really oppressing them, the Democratic Party. For years the Democrats have drummed it into the black community that they are nothing but victims, and will always be victims because of the evil Republicans. Democrats have been oppressing the minority community for decades and little has changed.
This country is reaching the breaking point, the Democrats were responsible for the first Civil War and they will be responsible for the one approaching. When we have teachers teaching our children that America is a bad place and every part of American must be wiped clean, America as we know it will not be around long. God help us.
This is one man’s opinion.

"On Putin's birthday, opposition activists protest, call for him to quit","MOSCOW/ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Police detained more than 200 opposition activists on Saturday for taking part in a wave of anti-Kremlin protests across Russia in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, ahead of a presidential election in March, a monitoring group reported.
Under grey skies and intermittent rain, over two thousand people gathered in central Moscow’s Pushkin Square and chanted “Russia will be free” and “Russia without Putin” before walking towards the Kremlin and parliament.
Police briefly detained a few people, but did not charge anyone. It was a different story at rallies in other cities however, and the OVD-Info monitoring group, a non-profit organization, said at least 262 people had been detained in 27 towns.
In St Petersburg, Putin’s home town, a Reuters witness saw riot police roughly detain at least 11 people. OVD-Info said at least 66 people had been detained in the city.
Navalny, who is serving a 20-day jail term for violating rules on public meetings, called the rally in Moscow and other cities to coincide with Putin’s 65th birthday.
Putin, who has dominated Russia’s political landscape for almost 18 years, is widely expected to run for what would be his fourth term.
Navalny hopes to run too, despite the central election commission declaring him ineligible due to a suspended prison sentence he says was politically-motivated.

One of the Moscow protesters held a homemade poster of Putin sitting on a mountain of banknotes, wearing a crown with the legend: “Happy Birthday you little thief!”
Others carried posters citing their right to protest, some waved Russian flags, and a few carried inflatable yellow ducks, a jokey reference to Navalny accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of owning a lavish estate with a duck house.
Medvedev called the claims politically-motivated nonsense.

In St Petersburg, some 1,500 activists waving red and white banners gathered in a square before heading for the city’s main street shouting “Putin is a thief” and “Free Navalny”.
PROTESTS MORE MODEST IN SIZE
The size of Saturday’s Moscow rally and others across Russia looked far more modest than Navalny-backed mass protests in March and June, which were widely recognized to be some of the biggest since 2012.
Many of the Moscow protesters were teenagers or in their twenties.

Carrying a yellow duck, Ulugbek Apsapayev, 17, said he had turned up because he wanted a better future for Russia.
“The duck is a sign that we support Alexei Navalny who also wants only good things for the country. But unfortunately we only have Vladimir Putin and his gang in power.”
Putin is popular across the country however, especially outside major cities where his strong leadership style and tough foreign policy stance go down well. He is expected to confirm later this year that he will run for another six-year term.
Opinion polls show he would comfortably beat Navalny if the opposition leader was allowed to run. Navalny says such polls are meaningless because there is no fair political competition.
Putin spent his birthday taking congratulatory calls from other world leaders, and chaired a security council meeting.
Authorities had refused to approve most of Saturday’s rallies, but Navalny says Russians’ right to protest is enshrined in the constitution.
A Reuters reporter at a rally in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg saw police detain at least eight people among a crowd of over 1,000 protesters.

US climber kills himself after avalanche kills girlfriend,"Image copyright Instagram
A renowned US mountain climber has killed himself one day after his girlfriend was fatally buried by an avalanche in the US state of Montana.
Inge Perkins, 23, and Hayden Kennedy, 27 - both sponsored outdoor athletes - had been backcountry skiing when a slab of hard snow slid down on top of them.
Ms Perkins was fully buried and killed by the slide. Mr Kennedy was lightly injured but able to call for help.
The death of the young couple has shocked the mountaineering community.
Mr Kennedy's death was confirmed by his father, Michael Kennedy, who spent 20 years editing the Colorado-based magazine Climbing.
""Hayden survived the avalanche but not the unbearable loss of his partner in life,"" Mr Kennedy wrote on Facebook.
""He chose to end his life. Myself and his mother Julie sorrowfully respect his decision.""
Image copyright Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center Image caption The avalanche swept the couple down the to the base of Mt Imp in the Madison range
Ms Perkins was killed after being caught and fully buried in a slide in the Madison mountain range beneath a peak called Mt Imp on Saturday 7 October.
The Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center reported that the slide occurred at around 10,000ft (3,048m) above sea level as the two were skiing uphill using climbing skins on the bottoms of their skis.
Mr Kennedy managed to dig himself out after being partially buried, but was unable to find Ms Perkins, who rescuers later discovered buried beneath 3ft (92cm) of snow.

The alpinist couple had recently moved to Bozeman, Montana, near to where the accident occurred, so Ms Perkins could complete her studies of mathematics and education at the Montana State University.
A Bozeman native, Ms Perkins had won multiple skiing and rock climbing competitions.
""I grew up bushwhacking around the Montana and Norwegian mountains with my parents, constantly whimpering from fear and discomfort, but always wanting to go out again,"" she wrote on her sponsored athlete profile.

Mr Kennedy, the son of well-known rock climbers, was studying to be an emergency medical technician, and had skipped university to pursue climbing.
He had recently climbed a new route on K7 in Pakistan, attracting the attention of the international alpinist community.
In September - only a week before his death - he wrote for the blog Evening Sends about the loss of friends in the wilderness.
""It's not just the memorable summits and crux moves that are fleeting,"" he wrote, describing a climb in Mexico with three friends who have all since died in the mountains.
""Friends and climbing partners are fleeting, too.""

U.N. assisting thousands of migrants stranded in Libyan smuggling hub,"Migrants sit in a detention center run by the interior ministry of Libya's eastern-based government, in Benghazi, Libya October 9, 2017. REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori
TUNIS (Reuters) - The U.N. migration agency said on Monday it was trying to provide assistance to large numbers of migrants who had been held in the smuggling hub of Sabratha as rival factions battled for control of the city.
At least 4,000 migrants, including pregnant women, newborn babies and unaccompanied children, have been transferred from informal camps and dormitories to a hangar in the city since the clashes ended on Friday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.
Sabratha has been the most common point of departure for mostly sub-Saharan African migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean by boat from Libya.
But the number of crossings dropped sharply in July after an armed group struck a deal with officials from the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to block departures, under pressure from Italy and other European Union member states.
That set off three weeks of fighting among rival factions which ended with the withdrawal of the armed group. The migrants who have since been rounded up were being held at sites that the group had controlled, local officials said.

“We are seriously concerned by the large number of migrants caught up in recent developments in Sabratha,” Othman Belbeisi, IOM Libya Chief of Mission, said in a statement.
Some migrants are being sent on to detention centers elsewhere in western Libya that are nominally under the control of the Tripoli government.

IOM officials say those centers, which were housing some 5,000 migrants, risk being overwhelmed by the new arrivals. Conditions in the centers are often dire and abuse widespread.
“Alternatives to detention must be found for migrants in Libya. In the meantime, IOM continues to provide direct humanitarian, health and psychosocial assistance to meet the urgent needs of the thousands of migrants being affected,” Belbeisi said.
Local sources have previously said that an estimated 10,000 migrants were being held in the Sabratha area.
The head of Sabratha’s department for countering illegal migration told Reuters on Saturday that help was urgently needed as some migrants had received no food or water for six days.

New Ghost Gun Update Allows 3D Printing of Untraceable Handgun,"By Derrick Broze
The controversial organization Defense Distributed just made it easier to create your own untraceable handguns.
On October 1, Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed began selling two of the most common handgun “80 percent” receivers. In addition to selling a computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) mill which can complete unfinished lower receivers for AR-15 semi-auto rifles, Defense Distributed will now sell unfinished receivers for Glocks and single-stack M1911s.
Using Defense Distributed’s mill, known as the Ghost Gunner, anyone with $1,600 and some basic milling knowledge can create the lower receiver of an AR-15 rifle. The term “ghost guns” was first popularized by gun control advocates because the weapons do not have a serial number and are thus untraceable. Wilson and Defense Distributed have since re-claimed the term in a sort of send-up to the U.S. government, which the company is still fighting over the alleged violations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
“It’s a certain type of person who builds and enjoys an AR-15—that’s a lot of gun, and most people don’t feel the need to have a big ol’ battle rifle,” Wilson told ArsTechnica. “But we believe lots of people are interested in the conversation about an untraceable, concealable handgun. It’s been on the roadmap the whole time for this project. It’s just always been a question of how we get there, and it ended up being very, very difficult—kinda like the brass ring of the project, if you will.”
“Just like the ARs and stuff, you’re making the identical item that you would otherwise handle, purchase, and fire—so it feels identical,” Wilson notes. “These are real guns.”
Wilson is a former University of Texas School of Law student who gained notoriety in the tech world for his involvement in a series of controversial digital projects, including Dark Wallet, an application to make bitcoin transactions anonymous and untraceable, and his efforts to spread firearms blueprints to the public via downloadable files. In January, Wired named Wilson one of the “most dangerous people on the Internet right now,” putting him in league with Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
In May 2013, Defense Distributed released a video of Wilson firing the world’s first fully 3D printable firearm, the 16-piece Liberator .380 single shot pistol. They also released the 3D printable files to the Internet. Within days the State Department demanded that the files be removed from public access, citing a violation of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Defense Distributed complied, though Wilson admitted to Forbes that removing all relevant data from public access “might be an impossible standard.”
With the release of the new lower receivers, advocates of gun ownership and privacy have achieved a victory. The government could not stop the spread of these weapons or this technology if it tried. It will eventually try and the Cody Wilsons of the world will do everything they can to break past the barriers set by the State. Obviously, individuals with ill intent could make use of this tech, just as the privacy advocate who wants to protect her family might make use of it. We cannot allow fear of bad men using these weapons drive us to support attempts at banning or restricting access. Tyrants want the people in fear and without a means for defense. Don’t fall prey to the manipulation and fear porn.

Report: Chicago Bulls working on an extension for Gar Forman,"Report: Chicago Bulls working on an extension for Gar Forman
(Before It's News)
The Chicago Bulls are right smack dab in the middle of a full rebuild after trading away superstar Jimmy Butler during the 2017 NBA Draft. Life has been rough for the organization the last 5 years or so. After Derrick Rose tore ligaments in his knee, he was never the same and the Bulls fell from the top of the Eastern Conference to the bottom where they currently sit. Instead of trying to get younger during the 2016 offseason, Gar Forman and John Paxson decided to bring in veterans Rajon Rondo and Dwyane Wade as a band-aid. It didn’t work. Frustrations toward this regime of Paxson and Forman have grown from fans and it’s really no secret. And now on Tuesday, news broke from 670 The Score’s Bernstein and Goff Show that the team is working on an extension for the General Manager Forman. Here’s what they tweeted out on Tuesday afternoon: https://twitter.com/Bernstein_Goff/status/915336688280489990 Click the tweet and see the reactions for yourself. Hint: It’s not good. For a team that went from the top seed in the 2010 Eastern Conference Playoffs to flat rock bottom this year, it’s mind-boggling that this regime is given another chance, yet, be considered for an extension. If Chicago’s young talent in Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen don’t show much promise this season, then things will get even worse in the organization. I think it’s a little too early to be thinking about an extension for either Paxson or Forman.

Doesn’t Pay to be Ordinary on Defense,"Doesn’t Pay to be Ordinary on Defense
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
One of the reasons yards allowed is such a misleading statistic is that defense lives on the variation of yardage to stop drives. Said otherwise, an offense can move the ball robotically up the field with average run or pass results each play. It’s the defense which requires substantial variation of result to stop drives, primarily in the form of turnovers, sacks, offensive penalties, and key incomplete passes.
So how did the Ravens fare in these categories versus the Jags:
— No turnovers
— No sacks
— The Jags committed 2 holding penalties which did not stall drives.
— They also had a holing flag and a false start on the same series of downs where they still managed to get a FG.
— While Bortles had 8 incomplete passes in the first half, only 1 stalled a drive resulting in a punt, and only 1 other was in the same set of downs that resulted in settling for a FG.
Take out the kneels and the fake punt and the Ravens allowed a solid 3.6 YPC and 5.5 yard per play on all competitive defensive snaps, but the Ravens defense failed in terms of the pressure required to make the high-variation plays.
Not Scheming for Pressure
Here are a few supporting details:
— Pees called for just 3 blitzes from off the line of scrimmage (Onwuasor, Mosley, Correa).
— The Ravens had only 1 blitz that was deceptive by my definition (the first pass of the game had Onwuasor’s blitz coupled with a stunt by Suggs).
— Bortles had ample time and space (ATS) on 15 of 24 plays in the first half.
— Of the 9 first-half drop backs which were not ATS, 5 were designed to have the ball out quickly and were not pressure generated by the pass rush.
If you’re reading this piece after a beating like the Ravens just took, you’ve seen me present this chart and supporting details many times before with a summary in words. I’ll tell you what…you caption this in 1 or 2 pithy sentences, put it in the comments, and I’ll make sure to mention the best ones on the podcast. To be clear, I’m not looking for “the pass rush sucked”, but something that provides a little more insight/explanation as to why.
Individual Notes by Positional Group
Defensive Line
The line was taxed heavily as the defense returned to many more 4-DB sets and 2.5 defensive linemen per play. That, coupled with the absence of Brandon Williams and injury to Urban left the Ravens shorthanded.
Willie Henry (40 snaps) made his NFL debut on defense. In addition to 4 run stuffs (gains of 3, 1, 1, 3), he lined up as a 1, 3, and 5 tech. He was flagged for encroachment, an ongoing concern after leading the team in penalties during the preseason. Willie didn’t generate any pressure in 18 pass snaps, but his play lends hope that the DL can hold up with the absence of Williams and Urban.
Carl Davis (42 snaps) had his play increased sharply. Similar to Henry, he had 3 run stuffs (1, -2, 0) and drew 1 flag. He also generated 1 pressure in 18 pass-rush snaps.
Michael Pierce (55 snaps) also was effective versus the run with 3 stuffs (2, 3, 2). The issue with run defense wasn’t in the middle as we’ll discuss. Michael had no pressure events in 27 pass rush snaps.
Brent Urban was lost for the season after 18 snaps. He had been the Ravens iron man so far this season and a good source of interior pass rush (1 PD vs. Jags). The Ravens have Bronson Kaufusi available as the most obvious 5-tech replacement for Urban, but I won’t be surprised if they activate both him and Chris Wormley vs. the Steelers if Williams must sit again. The combination of Wormley and Kaufusi give the option for fresh inside pass rushers in a game where the pressure must be effective.
Patrick Ricard (5 snaps on defense) played sparingly despite the scarcity of linemen. Of his snaps, 4 came in goal-line formations where the Ravens used all 4 available down linemen.
Linebackers
The Ravens activated all 8 of their linebackers (5 OLBs, 3 ILBs).
Here are the total snaps, pass snaps, and pressure events for each of the OLBs
This is the group that let the Ravens down most, especially considering the mediocre Jags OTs (Parnell, Robinson) who played the bulk of the snaps. In addition, all of the big runs allowed to RBs came on the edge.
Tyus Bowser (8 snaps) regressed badly after being named Defensive Rookie of the Week versus the Browns. He was the first to lose Marcedes Lewis in man coverage for a touchdown (Q1, 3:39) when he bit on the TE’s play-action chip block and did not follow his release until it was much too late. He lost the right edge to TE Koyack, which helped lead Fournette’s 15-yard run right (Q1, 5:00). He capped his day by losing the left edge to the FB Bohanon on Ivory’s 9-yard run left (Q3, 3:24). It was on that play that Mosley was visibly upset. Bowser was removed and did not return.
Kamalei Correa (22 snaps) had his best career game. His highlights:
— (Q1, 7:25): He pursued quickly to take down Fournette for a gain of 5 (2 + 3 YAC) between the numbers and right hash.
— (Q2, 2:16): He came on a well-timed blitz off the offensive left side to deliver an unblocked QH on Bortles, who grounded his screen pass.
— (Q4, 8:51): He had tight coverage of Bohanon by the right sideline and undercut the short route for a PD and near INT.
He appears to be taking a different stance, closer to the line of scrimmage than Mosley. Since I don’t see how that would help in coverage, I assume it’s a mechanism to get him to make a quicker impact on run plays.
Patrick Onwuasor (33 snaps) got the start. He finished with 7 tackles, including 3 run stuffs (1 an assist), which masked a mediocre day in coverage. In particular, he missed a tackle to allow 4 yards after contact by Lee (Q1, 2:05), appeared to lose coverage of Grant on his 18-yard reception (Q3, 13:43), and failed to cover Bohanon well on his 8-yard reception (1 + 7 YAC, Q3, 1:19) by the right sideline.
Secondary
Jimmy Smith (53 snaps) played well. He was beaten for a 13-yard completion by Cole (Q1, 4:23) despite outstanding coverage by the right sideline. He otherwise did not allow a reception to his assignment and registered 2 PDs, 1 on a big hit of Bohanon (Q3, 12:11).
Marlon Humphrey (21 snaps) extended his playing time and continued to produce at a high level. To summarize his highlights:
— (Q2, 5:04) He both stripped and forced out Lee in the right side of the end zone.
— (Q2, 2:13) He undercut Bortles’ 20-yard pass for Cole between the numbers and left hash for a PD and near INT, but the play was negated by Webb’s illegal contact flag across the field.
— (Q2, 1:25) He had close coverage, leapt to knock the ball away, and was called for a ticky-tack DPI versus Lee down the left sideline for 29 yards.
— (Q2, 0:46) He had tight coverage and was credited with a PD on a ball Cole lost off his fingertips. Smith had contact on this play that looked much more like pass interference than the previous play.
He again had the lowest yards per play of any Ravens defender (3.8), including a large personal contribution. For the season, the Ravens have allowed just 2.7 yards per play with him in and 5.8 yards per play with him on the sideline.
Tony Jefferson (61 snaps) didn’t impact the game as Ravens fans would have hoped, which is something that almost has to be true in a game where the opposing TE has 3 TD catches. Jefferson had excellent man coverage of Lewis in the back of the end zone (Q1, 10:33) as the defense stiffened to hold the Jags to their first FG. However, he was victimized in man coverage by Lewis, who split wide for his 3rd TD from an initial Jumbo set (Q3, 7:54). Bortles threw a simple jump ball (it wasn’t really a fade) to the 6’6” Lewis, against which Jefferson had good success in 2016.
In the interest of forgetting this debacle, we’ll dispense with the 3 defensive stars of the game.

Charles and Sara Rippey were among the 21 people killed by California's raging wildfires, which are still roaring across the state with no end in sight.
In many areas, the smoke is thick and the sky is orange. And the families of more than 500 people are still searching for their missing loved ones.
Here's what we know about some of the victims and those still missing:
The victims lost
Charles and Sara Rippey
The Rippeys' love affair started early -- Charles was in the sixth grade, and Sara was in the fourth grade, their son Mike said.
This undated photo of Charles and Sara Rippey was provided by their son Michael Rippey. The couple's bodies were found Monday.
After Charles went to fight in World War II, he returned and had five children with his beloved, Mike Rippey told KPIX. They recently celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary.
Mike Rippey said he believes his father died trying to save his mother. Charles Rippey's body was found in the charred remains of the hallway just outside where his wife was sleeping.
""From where they found his body, he was trying to get from his room to her room,"" he said. ""He never made it. Even if he had gotten there, he wouldn't have been able to get her out. ... And there is no way he would have left.""
Christina Hanson
The family of Christina Hanson searched frantically before learning she had died.
Christina Hanson saw the flames coming from afar. But the 28-year-old, who lived in an apartment next to her father's house in Santa Rosa, used a wheelchair.
Hanson first tried to reach her father, but to no avail, her aunt Cathy Riordan said. She then called her father's ex-wife, saying she saw an inferno and was scared.
Concerned neighbors told the family they called 911 to the property, but it's unclear what happened after those calls, Riordan said.
After a day of panic and uncertainty, Christina's cousin confirmed she had died.
""Sadly, we just found out that Christina did not survive the fire,"" cousin Brittney Vinculado said Wednesday.
Hanson's father, 55-year-old Michael Hanson, suffered third-degree burns on over half his body and was at Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital before it was evacuated, Riordan said. He was in a medically induced coma.
Sutter tried to transfer him by helicopter to San Francisco for treatment, but smoke prevented the chopper from taking off, Riordan said. Instead, he was transferred by ambulance.
Riordan said she believes her brother was injured trying to help his daughter.
""I know that's how he got burned,"" she said. ""(He) was trying to save her.""
The loved ones still missing
More than 600 people have been reported missing, but 315 of them have been located, authorities said. Spotty cellphone service has severely hampered relatives' ability to connect. Sonoma County deputies continue to search for 285 missing people, officials said.
Flames ravage a home in California's Napa wine region as multiple wind-driven fires continue whipping the region.
The situation could worsen, as firefighters keep battling 22 wildfires that have already scorched 170,000 acres.

Santa Rosa man hopes missing father is alive
Derek Southard hasn't heard from his 71-year-old father, Daniel, since Sunday night.
Southard, 29, lives with his father in Santa Rosa, California, but he attended a wedding nearly three hours away in Monterey on Sunday while his father stayed home.
""I had been texting him that day at the wedding. I told him I'd call him that night. And then he never called me back,"" Southard said, crying. ""He texted me at midnight and asked if I was having fun at the wedding. I guess the fire came an hour or two after that.""
Southard said the family reported his father missing on Monday.
When Derek got back to Santa Rosa on Monday, the neighborhood was still closed off. He called the sheriff and asked him to check on his father.
""The sheriff said his house was burned to the ground and his car was melted in the driveway, but I've still got my fingers crossed that he made it out somehow,"" Southard wrote Tuesday on Facebook.
Their next-door neighbors barely escaped the flames but they didn't have time to knock on his father's door, Southard said.
""As they were leaving, people were driving by and honking horns to try and wake people up,"" said Southard, who is staying with his girlfriend's family in San Francisco.
But Southard worries his father, who has trouble sleeping and takes sleeping pills, didn't hear the commotion. ""He's 71 and pretty hard of hearing,"" he said.
Sobbing, Southard said: ""I lost everything. My dad, my car and my dog and everything around.""
'They're absolutely terrified'
Rachael Ingram last heard from her close friend, Mike Grabow, late Sunday night when he told her the air was smoky as he drove to his Santa Rosa home.
""He knew it was bad,"" the 28-year-old Ingram told CNN.
She and Grabow, 40, had been at the Cooperage Brewing Company in Santa Rosa, where she is a bartender. The pair, friends for more than eight years, had been looking at maps of where the wildfires were before Grabow left to drive home.
Ingram, also a Santa Rosa resident, said she reported Grabow missing right away.
Ingram wrote on Facebook that she checked hospitals and the Red Cross shelter database, and listed Grabow with the fire department and sheriff's hotline.
""We have a pretty solid core group of friends that have been looking for him,"" she said. ""If he didn't show up at any of our houses,that's an immediate red flag for us. I called his brother first and alerted him and asked him to help,"" she said.
The brother went to Grabow's home on Monday and discovered the blaze had destroyed the home. The fire had melted the glass on Grabow's truck, Ingram said.
""He has tons of family in Idaho that are really worried about him, as well as family in Washington. I want to acknowledge what they're going through,"" Ingram said.
""They're absolutely terrified and we're trying to help them,"" she added."
Trump Twitter row with top Republican Senator Bob Corker,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Corker announced his retirement last week
US President Donald Trump has had an ill-tempered exchange with a leading Republican senator, aggravating already poor relations between the two men.
Foreign Relations Committee head Bob Corker was a ""negative voice"" and ""largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal"", Mr Trump tweeted.
Mr Corker hit back that the White House had become an ""adult day care centre"".
He was considered for the job of secretary of state by Mr Trump last year but they have since clashed.
Analysts suggest Mr Trump's tirade on Sunday morning may have been prompted by Mr Corker's message of support last week for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, which was also seen as a jab at the president.
He was quoted by media as saying that Mr Tillerson was ""in an incredibly frustrating place"" where he ""ends up not being supported in the way that I hope a secretary of state would be supported"".
On Wednesday Mr Tillerson denied rumours that he was about to resign.
Last month Mr Corker announced that he would not seek re-election at next year's mid-term elections. He has been an ardent supporter of the 2015 agreement to curb Iran's development of nuclear weapons.
Mr Trump has sharply criticised the deal on many occasions and is expected to de-certify it next week.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Trump said he refused to endorse Mr Corker for re-election
In a series of tweets, Mr Trump said: ""Senator Bob Corker 'begged' me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said 'NO' and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement).
""He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said 'NO THANKS.' He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!
""Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!""
Mr Corker responded: ""It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center.
""Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.""
The two men previously clashed in August when the senator criticised Mr Trump's response to the clashes between white supremacists and anti-fascist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Mr Trump responded by tweeting about Mr Corker's apparent hesitation about running for re-election."
US Navy is running a black project to detect ALIEN spacecraft under the ocean,"An expert in UFOs has said that the US Navy is behind a top-secret program for detecting unidentified submerged objects, also known as USOs, underneath the ocean.
 
Chief video analyst for MUFON, Marc D`Antonio, said that he had seen what he thought was an alien spacecraft that was traveling at speeds that were impossible when he was on a US Navy submarine down in the North Atlantic ocean.
 
He said that he overheard one of the naval officers telling the man operating the sonar to log the unidentified object down as part of the “Fast Mover Programme” as it was traveling several hundred knots. Submarines along with torpedoes go up to 40 knots thanks to the water resistance they encounter.
 
""UFO"" PROGRAM, Run by U.S NAVY
 
 
It has been said that Russia has a torpedo that is capable of traveling at more than 200 knots, however, there is not a craft or torpedo that is capable of traveling several hundred knots, and it would seemingly be impossible for humans to build.

Marc also runs FX Models, a special effects company that often takes on contracts for the Navy. He said that he had done some work for the Navy and to thank him they had offered him a ride in a submarine, which he accepted. He said that once they had gotten underway, he sat in the sonar station with the operator at his side.
 
He said that it is loud inside a submarine as while many people think that it is quiet, it is the opposite and there is always the noise of fans and a constant din. Marc said that he had been feeling a little seasick and was trying to zone out when he heard the man on the sonar shout out “fast mover”. He said he was jolted awake and wondered what was happening.
 
Marc told how the executive officer came out and asked the operator asked him how fast it was traveling to which the sonar operator answered several hundred knots. He was then asked to confirm it and went to another sonar machine, and it was the same answer. The sonar guy asked what he should do, and the officer told him to log it and then dog it. Which Marc said meant to log it then bury it.
 
Four years later Marc asked a senior naval figure about the “Fast Mover Programme, ” but he said that he could not talk about it. This was confirmation that the program exists. Marc said that he came to realize that USOs were common and the Navy has a program that logs them and determines the speed at which they travel and then puts it in a vault.
 
The claims of Marc were made at the Wyoming Devils Tower UFO Rendezvous, a place where like-minded UFO fans meet from around the USA at the site of the Close Encounters of the Third Kind rock to talk about anything that is related to aliens and spacecraft.

At the moment Marc is working with Douglas Trumbell, the visual effects supervisor from Close Encounters and they are working on a project that they believe will prove scientifically that aliens do exist. The project involves the design of ground units that detect UFOs which they are hoping to put in countries worldwide. At the moment the unit is being tested in the observatory of Marc, and he said that the UFOTOG II system is going to ensure that ufology comes into the 21st century as it brings together standard observation with real science.
 
He went on to say that the system looks for phenomena in the sky and should it come across something that is not a plane or satellite or any known object within the database it alerts the team by sending a message. Marc went on to say that they would be making any data that is collected available to everyone. He finished by saying that they remain open-minded and that they think that visitation by an alien race that is advanced is not an improbability scientifically.

Battle with Thor kicks off three-movie arc for Marvel's Hulk,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Marvel’s big green Hulk may not be getting his own standalone movie but actor Mark Ruffalo, who plays the current iteration of the superhero, said the character will get a mini arc within three upcoming Marvel movies.
Hulk, the muscle-bound, larger-than-life green alter-ego of scientist Bruce Banner, appears in the upcoming “Thor: Ragnarok,” out in U.S. theaters on Nov. 3, as a gladiator trapped on a futuristic planet and forced to fight Thor.
The Hulk will also appear in 2018’s “Avengers: Infinity War” and its sequel, 2019’s yet-to-be-titled Avengers 4.
“We’ve taken the arc of a standalone Hulk movie and put it into those three movies, consciously,” Ruffalo said.

Ruffalo, who has spent more time as scientist Banner than as the Hulk in the past two Avengers films, said he relished the opportunity to be in character as the Hulk for the majority of “Thor: Ragnarok.”
“This movie is about just breaking free of the forms and rules, and so I got to break free from what we thought Hulk was to a slightly more fleshed-out character,” he said.

The Hulk, who first appeared in comics in 1962, has had his own standalone television shows and movies in the past, notably 2003’s “Hulk” and 2008’s “The Incredible Hulk” films, both from Universal Pictures.
The cinematic rights to Marvel’s Hulk superhero are owned by Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) Universal Pictures, while Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) owns Marvel studios and is behind the current success of the superhero movie franchise.
“Ultimately Universal owns the rights there. I don’t see them like hanging out together any time soon to be like ‘Hey, let’s do another Hulk movie’,” he said."
Streaming Defenses (2016): Week 4: Which Offense Do We Want To Exploit?,"Streaming Defenses (2016): Week 4: Which Offense Do We Want To Exploit?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Things are constantly changing in the NFL, and what we knew at the time of our drafts is already “out of date” and irrelevant three weeks into the season though we are starting to get a grasp of the offenses we should look to pick on. With that in mind, which defenses that were likely ignored on draft day are worth considering for Week 4? Let’s take a look:
Tennessee Titans – at Houston
ESPN – 6.1%, CBS Sports – 22%
The Houston offense, behind a developing rookie quarterback, have allowed a league high 15 sacks while throwing for the third fewest yards (500). They have a talented backfield, with Lamar Miller and D’Onta Foreman (as well as Deshaun Watson being capable), but is that enough?
The Titans are right in the middle of the pack against running backs over the first three weeks (they’ve allowed the 17th most points per week), though it’s the receiving yards that have impacted them (175 yards and 1 TD). With Miller putting up 6 receptions and Foreman 2, that’s not something that’s going to scare you much.
The Titans have been worse against the pass this season, but with that not being a big threat this is an ideal situation to try and exploit.
Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore
ESPN – 58.4%, CBS Sports – 97%
Obviously they are a well owned defense in CBS leagues, but they are available in nearly half of ESPN leagues and are therefore worth including here. The matchup alone makes this appealing, as the Baltimore offense appears to be in shambles. The Ravens are averaging 17.0 points per game, putting them in the bottom third of the league, and are tied for second most interceptions (4). They also don’t have one dependable running back, with a cast of characters with no one clear candidate to dominate.
For their part the Steelers are allowing the second fewest yards per week (259.3), have forced the second most fumbles (7) and are tied for the second most sacks (11). You can argue against them as a streamer, but they are well worth using this week.

"Hoping to Have Trump Cleared, Legal Team Eases Resistance to Inquiry","Any public declaration by Mr. Mueller about the president’s innocence would also be a clear sign that the special counsel’s investigation has not broadened significantly beyond last year’s presidential campaign to include a close scrutiny of any of Mr. Trump’s past business dealings with Russians.
Whether the strategy will work is another matter. The plan rests on the premise that Mr. Trump has done nothing wrong — something the president has repeatedly told his lawyers and said publicly — and some lawyers connected to the investigation say that Mr. Cobb has been too willing to take the president at his word. If the White House moves too hastily, they argue, materials could end up in Mr. Mueller’s hands that might damage the president and other administration officials.
Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, previously expressed fears that the document production could set a bad precedent for future administrations. Mr. Cobb has told aides that the White House should move deliberately and carefully, but not drag its feet.
Others doubt that Mr. Mueller will publicly clear Mr. Trump anytime soon, even if the documents and interviews do not show that he committed a crime. Mr. Mueller is building cases against two of Mr. Trump’s former advisers, Paul J. Manafort and Michael T. Flynn. Should either man cooperate with investigators, it might change Mr. Mueller’s view of how Mr. Trump fits into the Russia investigation.
Nevertheless, the president’s advisers have concluded that this strategy represents their best chance to lift the cloud hanging over the administration.
“Good for them if they can pull it off,” said Barbara Van Gelder, a prominent Washington white-collar lawyer who served in the Justice Department with Mr. Mueller. She said he was highly unlikely to give the White House any assurances as long as the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn were open.
“Mueller’s not going to make a statement,” she said, “because he’s not going to want to claw it back.”

Mr. Comey had similar concerns. While F.B.I. agents investigated whether Mr. Trump’s associates had any connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Comey privately told Mr. Trump and members of Congress that the president was not personally under investigation. At least twice, however, he refused requests by Mr. Trump to say so publicly. Mr. Comey later told Congress that he did not want to make a public declaration that he might have to amend after further investigation.

One administration official said it was not yet clear how the White House would make its request for Mr. Mueller to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump, and there have been delays in getting documents to the special counsel. The internal White House review of the documents is not yet complete, and Mr. Mueller does not plan to interview many key White House officials until his team has reviewed all the documents he requested.
Mr. Cobb and several White House lawyers have spent weeks reviewing documents related to numerous subjects, including Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey, and his role in July in drafting a misleading statement to The New York Times about Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.
Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors have indicated that they plan to ask detailed questions about that statement, written aboard Air Force One, which withheld the purpose of the June 2016 meeting: to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government’s efforts to help Mr. Trump.

Some of Mr. Trump’s associates remain suspicious of the special counsel and his team of aggressive prosecutors.
“While it would be good to clear the air on this entire issue so that the president can focus on governing, it presupposes that Mueller is an honest broker, and that he would not take nothing and make it into something, which would be my concern,” said Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime informal adviser.
Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, said the White House should challenge Mr. Mueller if he investigates anything beyond whether Mr. Trump or his associates colluded with the Russian campaign to disrupt the election.
But White House officials say they do not want a repeat of some of the tactics used in the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton battled an independent counsel in court and in the media as the investigation dragged on for years. Since Mr. Cobb joined the White House, Mr. Trump’s team has significantly muted its criticism of Mr. Mueller.
One sign of the White House’s willingness to cooperate is that officials are strongly considering letting Mr. McGahn speak to investigators about his private conversations with Mr. Trump, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Many presidents insist that conversations with their White House counsel be kept secret under the principle of executive privilege, but Mr. McGahn is seen by some as a witness who could be helpful to Mr. Trump.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. McGahn was involved in the discussions about firing Mr. Comey, and officials believe he would say that Mr. Trump was warned that firing Mr. Comey would only prolong the Russia investigation. Lawyers believe that would help make the case that Mr. Trump was not trying to obstruct justice when he fired the F.B.I. director.
Even as the White House pushes for a swift resolution of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, administration officials are bracing for fallout from the investigations into Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to indict Mr. Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, who is under scrutiny for tax and foreign lobbying matters.
But lawyers in the case say they see no evidence yet that Mr. Manafort will face charges of conspiring with Russia to disrupt the election.
The White House also hopes for a favorable report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian election interference and several related matters. The committee’s leaders said this week that they planned to release a public report about their findings.
That report could be finished before Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Although committee leaders said they would leave any criminal matters to the Justice Department, a determination by the committee that none of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted the Russian campaign would be a boon for the White House even if Mr. Mueller refuses to publicly clear Mr. Trump.
“They want them to write a report saying ‘no collusion,’” said Ms. Van Gelder, the defense lawyer. “And then they can let Mueller twist in the wind.”"
U.S. Based Charity Is Robbing Mexico's Indigenous Communities of Water,"By Derrick Broze
A religious charity based in the United States claims to be helping the poor, but in reality, Living Water is contributing to a shrinking water supply for Mexico’s indigenous communities.
A report from Open Democracy details a disturbing system of corporate and state privilege and theft of indigenous resources. Journalist Tamara Pearson investigated the situation in Puebla, Mexico, specifically looking at the activities of Coca Cola, the charity Living Water, and non-profit Techo. “Here, people living in the wealthy part of town get all the water they need, and Coca Cola gets first dibs on the best water in the state. Meanwhile, the rest us get running water for half an hour a week, or none at all,” Pearson writes.
Living Water, a U.S. based religious charity that claims to provide the poor with water, currently has 132 projects in the state of Puebla. The projects are the result of the Mexican government encouraging private industry to invest in ownership bodies of water. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi Cruz, VP of Goldman Sachs, are listed in the leadership of Living Water.
Tamara Pearson interviewed Fernando, an indigenous activist from the Nahua community of Cuanala, in northern Puebla, to get a better understanding of the situation. Fernando is part of the National Indigenous Congress (CNI) and to Peoples Against the Privatization of Water (PUCPA). He tells Pearson that charities like Living Water and Techo “pave the way” for corporations to gain access to indigenous and rural people’s water. Specifically, groups like Techo and Living Water have partnerships with companies like Femsa (Coca Cola) for financing projects in indigenous communities under the pretext of providing water. According to Fernando, once the charities get in the communities, their corporate partners use their influence to steal water.
“Living Water went into indigenous towns like Ocotepec saying things like ‘Jesus says water is for everyone.’ At first, people trusted them, but then they realized the charity has connections to Femsa (Coca Cola) and they protested. There were arrests, and the police stopped the protests,” Fernando told Pearson. “In January the current state government sent the various municipalities (of Puebla state) a document saying that we had to approve an article in the water law that gives the state, and therefore companies as well, control over our water. They gave us a month to respond, and if we didn’t, then we had automatically approved it.”
Fernando also said the government is attempting to shut down the wells that the indigenous communities have built. Pearson also reports that Article 12 of the new water law also makes it illegal to collect your own water via well or rain collection. The law limits communities like Fernando’s to 20 liters of water per person per day. This supply is not enough to drink, water crops, and care for animals.
Even worse, Pearson was able to document the glaring inequality and double standard between the indigenous and rural communities and the wealthier cities. Fernando told Pearson that the wealthy living in the cities do not face the same water restrictions as the indigenous.
“Unlike where the rest of us live – where we get 30 minutes of water a week, if we’re lucky, and so we store that water in tanks on our roofs – in Angelopolis there are no tanks,” Pearson reports. “They have unlimited water, doing things the rest of us wouldn’t dream of, like filling their swimming pools, hosing down their patios and foot paths, and washing their pets regularly with a hose.”
The report also notes that Coca Cola continues to extract water from the sides of the Huitepec volcano in Chiapas. This water is taken away from the local indigenous communities and sold elsewhere for a high profit.
Fernando told Pearson that the fight for water security is a part of a larger struggle for land security. “We don’t waste water by washing it down the drains. We recycle it. The fight for water is a fight for life. You can’t separate water from land issues and struggles, from the economy, and from conflict and peace and justice,” he said.
The situation in Mexico has the appearance of yet another example of private industry using influence to screw over the people. However, on closer examination we can see that it was the state which first passed a law to give these charities and corporations the legal path for seizing local water supplies. At the end of the day, the people are opposed by an octopus with many tentacles. The corporations and the State work together to fleece the people, but without the corrupt politicians and government officials, the corporations would not be able to wield such power. We must decentralize and unplug from these systems and focus our efforts on building local community reliance. If I was you I would start here.

'It was all staged' says the alledged film-maker behind infamous 'alien autopsy' video,"Stunning admission about alien autopsy film.
 
Man behind infamous ‘alien autopsy’ video finally crucial details about the creation of the film, and its legitimacy. The creator, Spyros Melaris, has now openly admitted that his infamous ""Alien Autopsy"" film was entirely faked, and has offered an explanation for how he was able to fool so many.
 
In his new one man show on West End, Melaris reveals that the film claiming to show an alien body being examined in the 1940s was actually faked, and shot in a north London flat.
 
The famous ""alien autopsy"" video
 
 
He explains that his ""dead alien"", shown in the 17 minute clip watched by millions of people around the world, was actually a sculpture made for him by John Humphreys. Humphreys was a special effects expert known for his work on the television show Dr. Who.
 
Melaris, 58, explain to his West End audience how he made such a convincing mock-up. In order to create a realistic look for the doctors in the video, he sourced 1940s surgeons’ outfits and medical instruments from prop providers in the UK and USA.

Hackers Claim John McCain Knew ISIS Execution Videos Were Staged 
 
He explains that the two ""government pathologists"" in the video, who were filmed dissecting the pale, potbellied corpse of the ""extraterrestrial being"" were in reality his brother and girlfriend in a Camden apartment.
 
As for the alien's innards, they used cow and lamb organs from a local butcher shop. He explains that at one point they even considered using raspberry jelly for the brain, but felt it looked too dark.
 
In order to create a realistic look for the quality of the film itself, he spliced 16mm footage onto an original Pathe newsreel taken from a 1947 college baseball match in Roswell. This was done in order to persuade experts, who would be familiar with the age of the type of film used, that it could be genuine.
 
Ray Santilli, a musician, reputedly made many millions of dollars by taking the film and claiming the grainy black and white film was a product of the US military. He claimed it was created shortly after the 1947 Roswell UFO incident, thus linking the film with what is likely the most famous UFO sighting in history.
 
During his one-man show at London’s Leicester Square Theatre on Sunday, Melaris said, ""For me, it was just a joke, a bit of fun but I have learnt my lesson.""
 
Mr. Melaris:
 
<img src=""https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/pri_54377081.jpg?w=620&amp;h=1139&amp;crop=1"">
 
""I would like to say now that there is a big part of me that feels remorse. I underestimated the response. The reality is that everybody in the UFO community took this film as the smoking gun, proof of UFOs and aliens.""
 
However, some in the skeptic community are inclined to believe that the footage may in fact still be real and that Melaris has been pressured into retracting it. One of the first things that do not add up is that, although Melaris is taking credit for faking the film, Santilli is the one who actually made it public. How can anybody other than the man who found the film and publicized it retract it? How could anybody be sure Melaris really made the film? Additionally, it is not hard to imagine that, after the film regained traction on the internet, some government forces felt a need to cover it up. They would have then pressured Melaris to say he faked the film. Finally, why would a retraction take all of these years? The film first became public in 1995. If Melaris really did create the film and regret it, why would he take 22 years to retract it?

"Brazil agency says Bayer-Monsanto tie-up can hurt competition, urges conditions","FILE PHOTO: Monsanto logo is displayed on a screen where the stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on May 9, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A unit of Brazil’s competition regulator Cade has said Bayer AG’s proposed takeover of Monsanto Co. could be detrimental to competition and urged conditions for Brazilian approval of the corporate tie-up, a document released on the agency’s website shows.
The Bayer-Monsanto transaction, announced in September 2016, would create the world’s largest integrated pesticides and seeds company.
The Cade unit said that anticipated merger-related efficiencies were insufficient to mitigate its competition concerns, according to the document dated Oct. 3.
It recommended what it termed as “structural solutions” as a condition for final approval the deal, which will be in the hands of Cade’s seven-member tribunal.
Cade has 330 days to make a final decision since it began its review of the deal on April 24, a spokesman for the agency said. However, he added it may announce a ruling as early as Dec. 20.
The Cade unit said solutions included creating or strengthening another player to compete in the markets for soy and cotton seeds and in the sphere of biotech development.
But the unit has not engaged in an in-depth discussion with Bayer and Monsanto related to its suggested “remedies,” the document said.
In an emailed statement to Reuters, Bayer said the unit’s opinion is non-binding and does not mean the transaction will be blocked.
Hugh Grant, Monsanto’s chief executive officer, said concerns expressed by Brazil’s regulator are a normal step in the review process.
Brazil is Monsanto’s biggest market outside of the United States.
In its second-quarter results, Bayer said sales of its crop science division tumbled more than 15 percent primarily because of its business in Brazil, an indication of the country’s weight as a market for seed technology, insecticides and herbicides.
Deal opponents have asked Cade to block it or force divestments including Monsanto’s Intacta RR2 IPRO soy seed technology and Bayer’s glufosinate ammonium herbicides.
Last week, Monsanto’s chief executive officer for South America, Rodrigo Santos, told Reuters the company was set on keeping rights to Intacta.
Cotton farmers against the transaction assert the merged company would control 14 out of 15 genetically modified cotton seed technologies available in Brazil.

MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) - Two staff members of a Kenyan university were killed south of Mombasa on Tuesday when gunmen fired on vehicles carrying them and students to their campus, the area police chief said.
The identity of the gunmen was unclear. Police in the coastal county of Kwale, where the Technical University of Mombasa (TUM) has a campus, said they could be robbers or militants.
Security is poor in the area and the convoy had a police escort. Somali Islamist militants al Shabaab frequently carry out attacks along the Kenyan coast and have been recruiting new members there.
In 2015, al Shabaab gunmen killed 148 students at a university in Kenya’s Garissa town near the Kenya-Somali border, an attack that provoked shock and outrage in Kenya and abroad.
Two staff members of the university were killed Tuesday’s attack, and a driver and two policemen were wounded, area police chief Joseph Chebusit told Reuters.

“A bus carrying students of TUM was ferrying them from their hostels to the campus in Ukunda for classes and was being escorted by a van that had some staff of the college and two escort police officers,” the policeman said.
“Armed men numbering about 10 emerged from the bushes and started firing at the van in front. As a result two ladies who are staff of TUM were killed in the van. The driver of the van and two police officers were injured,” he said.

“We have information that the attackers had other accomplices along the road who were monitoring the movement of the two vehicles and communicating with them to enable the attack,” he added.
“For now we are treating it as a crime like any other as we continue with investigations but that does not mean we are ruling out al Shabaab.”
A witness who did not want to be named told Reuters she and several other students had fled their vehicle when gunmen opened fire on them and had seen several students covered in blood.
But Chebusit said no students were injured."

Amazon and Apple caught in latest EU tax crackdown,"Image copyright Alamy
The European Union has launched a fresh crackdown over taxes paid by tech giants Amazon and Apple.
Amazon has been ordered to repay €250m (£221m; $293m) in back taxes after the European Commission said it had been given an unfair tax deal in Luxembourg.
The Commission also plans to take Ireland to court over its failure to collect €13bn of back taxes from Apple.
Amazon denied it owed any back tax, saying it did ""not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg"".
""We will study the Commission's ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.
But European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the Luxembourg arrangement meant that Amazon had been allowed to pay ""substantially less tax than other businesses"", which it said was ""illegal under EU state aid rules"".
Facebook's UK tax bill rises to £5.1m
Why Amazon's UK tax bill has dropped 50%
Apple fights back over EU tax ruling
'Selective' benefits
""Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three-quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed,"" Ms Vestager added.
She said Amazon paid four times less tax than other local companies.
""Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others,"" she added.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Commission said until the taxes were recovered Apple was still ""continuing to benefit from an illegal advantage""
Meanwhile, the Commission said it planned to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover €13bn in back taxes from tech giant Apple.
It concluded last year that the US firm's Irish tax benefits were illegal, enabling the firm to pay a corporate tax rate of no more than 1%.
The Commission said that more than a year on from that decision, Ireland had still not recovered the money.
As a result, it was referring Ireland to the European Court of Justice, it said.
Ireland, which has contested the decision, claiming that EU regulators were interfering with national sovereignty, said the decision was ""extremely disappointing"".
""Today's decisions are to order Luxembourg to recover unpaid tax from Amazon and refer Ireland to the European Court for failing to recover unpaid tax from Apple. I hope that both decisions are seen as a message that companies must pay their fair share of taxes, as the huge majority of companies do,"" said Ms Vestager.
Amazon investigation
The decision on Amazon follows a three-year long investigation by the European Commission, which said in 2014 that it had suspicions the arrangement had broken EU rules.
The tax deal between Luxembourg and Amazon was struck in 2003.
The Commission said it had enabled Amazon to shift the ""vast majority"" of its profits from Amazon EU to Amazon Europe Holding Technologies, which was not subject to tax.
It said this arrangement had ""significantly reduced"" Amazon's taxable profits.
At the time the deal was struck, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission's president, was the prime minister of Luxembourg."
Zak Hardaker: Castleford Tigers full-back banned after positive drugs test,"Media playback is not supported on this device 'Don't mess about with drugs' - McDermott
England and Castleford Tigers full-back Zak Hardaker has been provisionally suspended after testing positive for cocaine and will miss the World Cup.
The 25-year-old was omitted from the Tigers' squad for Saturday's Grand Final loss to Leeds Rhinos and was not named in England's squad on Monday.
Hardaker's failed test came after a Super 8s game against Leeds, his former club, on 8 September.
He could be suspended for two years as a result of his positive test.
In a statement on the club website, Hardaker said: ""I would like to apologise to my team-mates, the staff and all fans for my enormous error of judgment.
""I was given an opportunity by this great club and in what has been one of the most important weeks in its history, I have let everyone at the club down. For that, I truly apologise.
""Finally, I would like to make it clear that in no way did I, nor would I, ever take a substance with the intention of enhancing my performance.""
Hardaker was one of three nominees for Super League's Man of Steel award, having scored 13 tries in 30 games as Tigers won the League Leaders' Shield for the first time, and was expected to be named in the England squad for World Cup in Australia.
""The Rugby Football League can confirm that Zak Hardaker is provisionally suspended from all competition after it received notification from UK Anti-Doping that he had tested positive for a banned substance,"" read a statement from the RFL.
""He will therefore not be considered for the England Rugby League World Cup squad due to be announced on Monday at 12:00 BST.""
The RFL and Castleford said they will be making no further comment until the outcome of the case has been determined.
Hardaker absence 'a big disruption'
Media playback is not supported on this device McGuire stars as Leeds make Grand Final history
Castleford said on Thursday that Hardaker had been left out of their Grand Final squad because of a ""breach of club rules"".
Speaking after Saturday's 24-6 defeat by Leeds at Old Trafford, head coach Daryl Powell said: ""I still thought we had a team out there that could have won the game if we'd played anywhere near our potential.
""But if you take a player like him out of any team, it's going to be a disruption.
""You take your full-back out two days before the game, and you have one session of preparation - it's clearly not going to help.
""It is what it is. There's absolutely nothing we can do about that.""
Castleford, who were without Zak Hardaker, were beaten 24-6 by Leeds in Saturday's Grand Final
On-field brilliance, off-field problems
Hardaker joined Castleford on an initial loan deal for 2017 that was later made permanent, after a stint in Australia with Penrith Panthers.
That brought his six-year spell at Leeds to an end and reunited Hardaker with Powell, who gave him his break at Featherstone Rovers.
At Leeds, Hardaker won three Grand Finals, a Challenge Cup winner's medal and the 2015 Man of Steel prize.
But his on-field brilliance has been marred by off-field problems throughout his career.
He missed out on the 2013 World Cup and was fined by Leeds after he ""acted unprofessionally"", before going on an anger management course following an incident in Leeds during the 2015 season.
'He still has a chance for redemption'
Analysis: BBC rugby league correspondent Dave Woods
If you met Zak Hardaker, your likeliest first impression would be of a lovely lad who is endearingly honest about the mistakes he's made. The problem is that he keeps making those mistakes.
Despite his outstanding rugby league talents that were taking him to the very top in the game, his career is now defined by his wrong choices off the field.
Currently the best English full-back around and tipped to get even better, he will instead be remembered for missing the 2013 World Cup because of a boozy brawl on the eve of the tournament, being effectively kicked out by Leeds for a catalogue of off-field indiscretions and now missing a Grand Final and another World Cup for this latest catastrophic choice of behaviour.
It's incredibly frustrating to team-mates and fans that so much talent has been squandered. But he still has a chance for some redemption.
Without pre-judging any mitigating circumstances he may use in his defence, the probable outcome of this failed drug test is a two-year ban.
He turns 26 in a few days, so he is of an age where he could still return and perform at the highest level again. That depends on how well he is supported and mentored in the next couple of years, though both Leeds and Castleford have done their best in the past.
So more importantly it now comes down to the quality of his own decisions.
In short, it's time for the lad to grow up."

Trump nominee defends move to void gay worker protections,"Sam Brownback, in line to be ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, on Wednesday defended his decision as Kansas governor to scrap an order that barred discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Brownback in 2015 rescinded the order issued in August 2007 by then-Gov. Kathleen Sebelius that banned discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender individuals in hiring and employment agencies under the governor's direct control. He told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at his confirmation hearing that Sebelius, a Democrat, had acted unilaterally and undercut the Kansas' legislature.
Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, a former Virginia governor, asked Brownback whether such an order sends a clear signal to a state's agency chiefs that discrimination based on sexual orientation won't be tolerated.
""I think that would be a rational thing,"" Brownback responded. ""I just don't think it's a right that the executive branch should create without the legislative branch.""
Brownback, a favorite of Christian conservatives for his strong stances against abortion and same-sex marriage, also declined to unequivocally declare there is no situation that would allow a country to cite religious freedom as the basis for criminally prosecuting LGBT people.
""I don't know what that would be, in what circumstance,"" he said in response to a question from Kaine.
Brownback pledged to ""continue the policies that have been done in the prior administration in working on these international issues.""
Kaine said he expected an unambiguous answer. The senator said there are still ""countries around the world where you can be imprisoned and even executed if you are LGBT.""
Brownback served in the U.S. Senate before his election as governor in 2010. Five years ago, he made Kansas an economic laboratory for the nation by aggressively cutting taxes. But if he's confirmed by the full Senate, Brownback will leave office with his Kansas reputation in tatters and his home state an example of trickle-down economics that didn't work.
LGBT-rights groups decried Brownback's nomination because of his socially conservative views. But his fellow Republicans hailed his choice.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Brownback ""has been a longtime champion of religious freedom globally.""
Brownback also would leave a Kansas legacy of far tougher restrictions on abortion and fewer limits on gun owners than when he won the first of his two terms in 2010.
He rejected expanding the Medicaid health program for the poor in line with former President Barack Obama's signature health care law even as several other Republican governors went ahead.
Brownback was an early advocate of U.S. action to stop genocide in Sudan's Darfur region, and visited Congo and Rwanda to decry humanitarian crises and call for better coordination in foreign aid programs.
President Donald Trump announced Brownback's selection in July. He'll run the State Department's Office of International Religious Freedom if his nomination is approved.

Cambodia deports 74 Chinese arrested for telecom extortion scams,"Chinese nationals (in orange vests) who were arrested over a suspected internet scam, are escorted by Chinese police officers before they were deported at Phnom Penh International Airport, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, October 12, 2017. REUTERS/Samrang Pring
PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia on Thursday deported 74 Chinese nationals wanted in China on suspicion of extorting money from people there over the internet and by telephone, Cambodian police said.
This raises the number of people from China and Taiwan who have been deported this year for suspected telecom scams to 346, Uk Heisela, the head of the Cambodian police told reporters at a press conference at the airport in the capital of Phnom Penh.
Several hundred suspected scammers have been arrested in Cambodia, which has emerged as a major center of rackets that have cost the victims billions of dollars.
A team of Chinese police arrived at the airport on a China Southern Airlines flight to pick up the suspects, who wore masks and had numbers marked on pink shirts.

Uk Heisela said the 74 suspects, including 14 women, had been detained on Oct. 5 in the seaside town of Sihanoukville. Two Indonesians were also deported back to their home country.
“They tricked victims in China, the civil servants there, such as teachers, medics and artists,” Uk Heisela said.

In some cases, they had obtained naked pictures of the victims and used them for blackmail, he said.
Cambodia is one of China’s closest allies in Southeast Asia. More than 400 Chinese and Taiwanese were arrested in Cambodia in August alone for suspected telecom scams.
The country’s good internet connections and relaxed immigration laws have attracted con artists to carry out crimes."
Paddock Shot Security Guard BEFORE Mass Shooting,"By Jon Rappoport
Huge can of new worms…
LA Times: “Police said Paddock fired 200 rounds into the hallway” wounding a hotel security guard.
LA Times, October 9: “Police have dramatically changed their account of how the Las Vegas massacre began on Oct. 1, revealing Monday that the gunman shot a hotel security guard [in the leg through the closed door of his hotel room] six minutes before opening fire on a country music concert — raising new questions about why police weren’t able to pinpoint the gunman’s location sooner.”
The previous police story was: Paddock shot security guard Campos after he finished firing on the concert crowd.
The LA Times focuses on how this new information changes the timeline of events—in particular, the addition of minutes before police arrived at Paddock’s door.
Really? That’s the takeaway?
There is a far more serious question. Why did Paddock shoot the security guard through his hotel room door, with 200 rounds of ammunition (according to police), BEFORE starting to fire on the concert crowd?
Whether or not Paddock was using a silenced weapon to shoot the security guard, didn’t he think 200 rounds through a door might possibly alert people in the hotel to what he was about to do—kill people at the concert?
Security guard Campos, according to the Times, was on Paddock’s 32nd floor to check on an alert about another guest’s room door having being left open. Campos wasn’t there to check on Paddock. There is no indication Paddock was suspected of anything.
The new Vegas police sequence of events now goes this way: Paddock is in his room preparing to slaughter people at the concert; security guard Campos comes to the 32nd floor to check on a report of another guest’s door having been left open; Paddock sees Campos out in the hallway outside his door (using a camera Paddock had installed); Paddock fires 200 rounds through his door and hits Campos in the leg; leaving Campos there, Paddock then WAITS SIX MINUTES and begins firing through his broken window(s) at the concert crowd.
Perhaps the police will change their story yet again. Paddock didn’t fire 200 rounds through his door. He stepped out into the hallway and wounded Campos with one shot using a silenced handgun. He then left Campos there, went back into his room, waited six minutes, and then started firing on the concert crowd.
Or, after wounding Campos with one bullet, he paid Campos with a pile of casino chips and told him to wait in the hallway and say nothing to anyone for a half-hour.
Or he bound and gagged Campos after shooting him in the leg and stuffed him into a laundry closet in the hallway.
Or, the most popular tactic in these untenable and absurd stories: “Obviously, Paddock was crazy. There is no way to account for all his actions. We may never know why he did what he did.”
That usually works with the public. The police or the FBI paint themselves into a corner trying to hide the truth. They realize their latest version of events makes no sense. So they invoke the time-honored “we may never know” explanation.
If some reporter wakes up from his stupor and resists going along with the story, he’ll probably hear: “Yes, we’re looking into that. But we have no further comment at this time.”
Or most likely, any time.
Here is a reasonable assessment: since very early on, police had decided on this story: Paddock was the shooter; he was the only shooter; he wounded the security guard after he finished firing on the concert crowd.
But the fact that the security guard was wounded BEFORE the concert shooting was leaking out. People in Las Vegas knew about it. So the cops (or the FBI) decided they had to get out ahead of the leak, if possible. It would be better to change their story than wait and end up with egg on their faces.
And so far, it looks like they made a smart move. Because how many media outlets are pointing out how crazy the new story is?
Most importantly, how many other egregious lies are sitting under the previous security-guard lie? How many other devious twists and turns in the true tale are being hidden?

Israeli spies found Russians using Kaspersky software for hacks: media,"The logo of the anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab is seen at its headquarters in Moscow, Russia September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin
((This version of the story corrects to remove name of Kaspersky spokesperson cited by Washington Post in 15th paragraph. The story quoted a company statement).)
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli intelligence officials spying on Russian government hackers found they were using Kaspersky Lab antivirus software that is also used by 400 million people globally, including U.S. government agencies, according to media reports on Tuesday.
The Israeli officials who had hacked into Kaspersky’s network over two years ago then warned their U.S. counterparts of the Russian intrusion, said the New York Times, which first reported the story. (nyti.ms/2yev8Vj)
That led to a decision in Washington only last month to order Kaspersky software removed from government computers.
The Washington Post also reported on Tuesday that the Israeli spies had also found in Kaspersky's network hacking tools that could only have come from the U.S. National Security Agency. wapo.st/2i2clXa
Related Coverage Germany: 'No evidence' Kaspersky software used by Russians for hacks
After an investigation, the NSA found that those tools were in possession of the Russian government, the Post said.
And late last month, the U.S. National Intelligence Council completed a classified report that it shared with NATO allies concluding that Russia’s FSB intelligence service had “probable access” to Kaspersky customer databases and source code, the Post reported.
That access, it concluded, could help enable cyber attacks against U.S. government, commercial and industrial control networks, the Post reported.
The New York Times said the Russian operation, according to multiple people briefed on the matter, is known to have stolen classified documents from a National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, which had Kaspersky antivirus software installed on it.
It is not yet publicly known what other U.S. secrets the Russian hackers may have discovered by turning the Kaspersky software into a sort of Google search for sensitive information, the Times said.
The current and former government officials who described the episode spoke about it on condition of anonymity because of classification rules, the Times said.
The newspaper said the National Security Agency and the White House declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy, while the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.
The Russian embassy in Washington last month called the ban on Kaspersky Lab software “regrettable” and said it delayed the prospects of restoring bilateral ties.
Kaspersky Lab denied to the Times any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Russian hacking. “Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, has repeatedly denied charges his company conducts espionage on behalf of the Russian government.
The company issued a statement saying that “as a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight,” the Washington Post reported. The company “does not possess any knowledge” of Israel’s hack, the Post cited the statement as saying.
U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a multipronged digital influence operation last year in an attempt to help Donald Trump win the White House, a charge Moscow denies."
NFL Reviewing Terrelle Pryor's Alleged Racially Charged Incident with Chiefs Fan,"Mark Tenally/Associated Press
The NFL is reportedly reviewing an altercation between Washington wide receiver Terrelle Pryor and a fan at Arrowhead Stadium from Monday's 29-20 Kansas City Chiefs victory.
Adam Schefter of ESPN reported the news, noting the league is ""reviewing all aspects"" of the exchange, ""including what took place in [the] stands.""
This comes after Pryor said in an Instagram Stories post Wednesday night the fan called him ""a n----r"" and that he had been called the N-word multiple times by fans throughout the game. Craig Hoffman of 106.7 The Fan shared Pryor's comments (warning: NSFW language), which noted an NFL employee had to stand by him after the racial slurs started.
TMZ Sports passed along footage on its YouTube page (warning: NSFW language) that revealed Pryor raised his middle finger at a fan.
Pryor apologized to his teammates and the Washington organization in his post but acknowledged interactions like the one he had are why some NFL players have elected to protest racial inequality by kneeling during the national anthem.
On the field, Pryor finished with three catches for 70 yards and a touchdown—his first as a member of Washington. However, a field goal by Harrison Butker and last-second defensive touchdown by Justin Houston sealed the win for the Chiefs."
Rugby World Cup 2023: A bugger's muddle,"Rugby World Cup 2023: A bugger's muddle
(Before It's News)
This week has seen London play host to the bids of France, South Africa and Ireland to stage the 2023 Rugby World Cup, with the respective bidding teams displaying their respective wares in front of World Rugby.
With France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, deciding that he couldn’t be arsed to attend the presentation or endorse the French bid, France’s bidding team turned to an ingenious (although somewhat bizarre) Plan B by choosing to parade the young sons of New Zealand rugby legend, Jonah Lomu as part of the bid. Jonah quite liked France, apparently. Which is nice.
South Africa’s strategy, meanwhile, appeared to be based on the fact that they once hosted the Rugby World Cup well over 20 years ago when that very nice, smiley man Nelson Mandela was President. No mention, surprisingly, that for financial reasons South Africa had recently decided against bidding to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games.
And as for the Irish, apparently if Ireland wins the bid to host the World Cup in 2023 it will somehow (and I kid you not) make rugby incredibly popular in the United States of America. Call me naive, but wouldn’t hosting the event in the USA be more likely to do that?
Go figure, and while you’re doing that please bear in mind that the Irish bid has also won the backing of UK Prime Minister Theresa May. What could possibly go wrong?

False Flag in Vegas Shooting?,"By Jon Rappoport
 
False flags always target the psychological state of mind of the public. Mind control is the goal.
 
To boil it down, a false flag is an operation staged to blame someone for a crime, someone who didn’t commit the crime.
 
Why? Because by blaming that person or group, and by convincing many others to blame that person or group, you achieve an important objective.
 
Simplistic over-exaggerated version: “Last night, a homeless man was found shot dead in an alley. The gun was found next to his body. The Mayor’s fingerprints were on the [planted] gun. The Mayor was arrested at his office. The election nears. The Mayor’s opponent now appears to have a clear path to victory…”
 
Less simplistic version: “…the worst mass shooting in US history. Stephen Paddock, 64, has been named as the Las Vegas shooter. He is dead. He killed 58 people at a concert and wounded 515 others. In the Congress, calls are rising for new gun control laws…”
 
But, as it turns out, the evidence suggests there were multiple shooters in the Mandalay Hotel. Paddock may or may not have been one of them. The overall operation was designed to invoke widespread horror and fear, and usher in new restrictions on gun ownership…
 
 
 
 
 
The other possible shooters in the hotel would have been professionals, tasked with killing as many people as possible at the country music concert.
 
Gun control would not be the only agenda in this false flag.
 
Heavily militarized police all over this country would be another agenda.
 
Putting a significant dent in the economy would be another—if attendance at public events and in crowded public places diminishes.
 
Such a reduction in attendance could even affect political forums and other gatherings where free speech and the right to assemble are vital. (We’ve already seen significant disruptions of these events.)
 
Invoking fear and passivity in the population is another basic agenda. This leads to the attitude: “Let the authorities handle everything.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
We could see new, more outrageous violations of Constitutional search and seizure principles, all in the name of “the need for security.”
 
As in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, there may be new calls for psychiatric screening of the population, including young children, in order to “spot criminals before they commit crimes.” This is sheer madness, because no so-called mental disorder is based on any defining lab test, and many of the prescribed drugs (SSRI antidepressants) push people over the edge into committing violence. —More violence, more calls for psychiatric screening, more drugs, more violence: an escalating scenario and repeating cycle, leading to tighter Control from above.
 
When was the last time you saw a major false flag exposed by the mainstream press, and then admitted to by the actual perpetrators, who then explained their true objectives?
 
Never.
 
False flags are, over the long term, essential to maintaining and expanding the status quo: power is collected and increased at the top, and then exerted downward.
 
Note: All prior analyses I’ve made about the duration of the shooting, and numbers of people killed and injured, are subject to change. Why? Because as yet, we have no accurate reports on how many of the 515 people injured were actually shot versus trampled or hurt in some other fashion. Also, police reports that are emerging differ on the duration of the shooting. The NY Times is talking about roughly 7 minutes. Newsweek suggests the duration is longer.
 
 
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample (Ad)
 
Nevertheless, the background of the purported shooter, Stephen Paddock, gives no indication of any competence with auto weapons, gives no indication he could have dealt with the problems and challenges of using such a weapon—and on top of that, his state of mind at the time, as an non-professional, would have been unstable, to say the least.
 
Any reasonable law-enforcement group investigating this mass shooting would certainly keep its options open, regarding other perpetrators. But that is not what is happening here. The books are closed on this case. There is no going back.
 
The desired result has been achieved. One shooter, mass killings. End of story. Objective achieved.
 
That rush to judgment and “closure” is also a prime feature of the false flag. It has to be.

"Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump","LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.
Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of angry statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.
Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear programme. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.
Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organisation. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.
“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” said Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander.
“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behaviour. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”
Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.
“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hassan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticising the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.
“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures.”
U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).
Russia, Iran’s ally that is also fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, said on Tuesday that it does not consider the Revolutionary Guards to be a terrorist organisation.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”
The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear programme that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.
But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and over allegations that it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.
The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.
The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.
“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.
Iran’s Central Bank governor, Valiollah Seif, was also quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency that “Trump’s words might have an emotional impact on the foreign exchange market, but it would not be long-term”.
Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile programme. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.
Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile programme.
Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”.
In an article published in the Atlantic magazine on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles ... unless it intends to attack our territory.”"

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An indigenous woman backed by Mexico’s rebel Zapatista movement registered on Saturday to run as an independent candidate in next year’s presidential election, adding to a growing list of hopefuls bucking established political parties.
Maria de Jesus Patricio Martinez is the spokeswoman for the National Indigenous Congress, the political arm of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), and in May was picked to be the group’s 2018 presidential candidate.
Local media reported that after Patricio Martinez registered with the National Electoral Institute (INE), she pledged not to accept any funding from the government to run her campaign.
Mexico’s major political parties have struggled to gain support in recent years, and voter surveys show all presidential hopefuls struggling to win support from as much as a third of the electorate.
The front-runner in most polls is former Mexico City mayor and two-time presidential runner-up Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist with nationalistic leanings.
The ruling centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of President Enrique Pena Nieto, who is barred by law from seeking a second term, has yet to pick a candidate.
Already, more than 10 first-time independent candidates have registered to run. Three of those contenders failed to meet initial requirements, according to the INE.

Also on Saturday, maverick Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodriguez, a former PRI member, expressed his interest to register his own independent run for the presidency.
Last week, Armando Rios Piter, an independent former member of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), formally registered his candidacy, further crowding the pool of anti-establishment candidates.

Independent presidential aspirants have four months to gather 866,593 signatures, representing 1 percent of the electorate, in at least 17 regions of Mexico to qualify as an independent candidate ahead of the July 2018 vote.
Patricio Martinez, a traditional healer and native Nahua speaker, is originally from the central Mexican state of Jalisco.
Her support from the Zapatistas marks a more visible turn for the insurgent movement, which has faded in recent years.
Just after the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into force in 1994, the EZLN led armed indigenous insurgents in a “declaration of war” against the government in southern Chiapas state.
A 12-day battle with the Army claimed at least 140 lives and become an early symbol for supporters of the anti-globalization movement."

Five-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady has joined the ranks of those who are shanking President Trump in the back, not that he probably has much choice considering who signs his paychecks.
Following a near-death experience at home against the Houston Texans, the New England Patriots quarterback spoke out against his “divisive” friend on a local sports talk show in Boston.
At the end of the day, Brady is a company man and the NFL is in a massive campaign to salvage the season that Commissioner Roger Goodell has already ruined through his failure to deal with those who are disrespecting the flag.
Brady parroted the league public relations propaganda that football brings us all together. This may have been true as recently as 2015, but thanks to the league’s botching of the Colin Kaepernick situation which has now turned into an open revolt, the NFL under Goodell has managed to alienate millions of loyal fans.
Not even Tom Terrific can save it either.
JUST IN: Brady breaks with Trump: “I certainly disagree with what he said” https://t.co/FaycmUtDM6 pic.twitter.com/oy6iyUQOLP — The Hill (@thehill) September 25, 2017
Via The Hill “Brady: Trump’s comments ‘just divisive’”:
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said early Monday that he doesn’t agree with President Trump’s comments attacking NFL players who refuse to stand during the national anthem. “Yeah, I certainly disagree with what he said. I thought it was just divisive,” Brady said during a radio interview in Boston. “Like I said, I just want to support my teammates.” Brady, who has described Trump as a friend, said he is never one to say whether something is right or wrong. “I do believe in what I believe in. I believe in bringing people together and respect and love and trust,” he said. “Those are the values that my parents instilled in me. That is how I try and live every day.” Football is something that brings people together from all across the country, he added. “The one thing about football is it brings so many guys together — guys you would never have the opportunity to be around,” Brady said. “Whether it was in college, and all the way into the pros. We’re all different, we’re all unique. That is what makes us all special.”
Brady may be able to perform miracles on the field and bring a team back from a nearly insurmountable deficit in the Super Bowl but he is wading into foreign waters here and the journey is one of great peril.
Millions of Americans are fed up with the politicization of sports thanks to the NFL’s coddling of the malcontents who spit on the flag, not to mention the lousy quality of the game which has become unwatchable under Goodell’s tenure.
Trump just gave them a voice and judging by the fierce reaction of NFL owners, their mouthpieces in the media and high-profile players like Tom Brady, the league knows that it has an existential crisis on its hands now.
To quote the poet Victor Hugo “nothing is more powerful as an idea whose time has come” and that is exactly why the NFL is terrified, people are increasingly finding that they have better things to do with their time.
All of that money that has sluiced into the tax-exempt league’s coffers over the years is about to take a serious hit and will have a ripple effect that will eventually cut into player salaries.
Brady will likely be retired by that point having already made bank, but the goose that laid the golden egg now has its head firmly on the chopping block and the league itself is swinging the ax.

US Seeks to Monopolize Cyberwarfare,"By Ulson Gunnar
The use of information to enhance martial power goes back to the beginning of human civilization itself, where propaganda and psychological warfare went hand-in-hand with slings, arrows, swords and shields.
The most recent iteration of this takes the form of social media and cyberwarfare where tools are being developed and deployed to influence populations at home and abroad, to manipulate political processes of foreign states and even tap into and exploit global economic forces.
In the beginning of the 21st Century, the United States held an uncontested monopoly over the tools of cyberwarfare. Today, this is changing quickly, presenting an increasingly balanced cyberscape where nations are able to defend themselves on near parity with America’s ability to attack them.
To reassert America’s control over information and the technology used to broker it, Jared Cohen, current Google employee and former US State Department staff, has proposed a US-created and dominated “international” framework regarding cyberconflict.
His op-ed in the New York Times titled, “How to Prevent a Cyberwar,” begins by admitting the very pretext the US is using to expand its control over cyberwarfare is baseless, noting that “specifics of Russia’s interference in the 2016 America election remain unclear.”
Regardless, Cohen continues by laying out a plan for reasserting American control over cyberwarfare anyway, by claiming:
Cyberweapons won’t go away and their spread can’t be controlled. Instead, as we’ve done for other destructive technologies, the world needs to establish a set of principles to determine the proper conduct of governments regarding cyberconflict. They would dictate how to properly attribute cyberattacks, so that we know with confidence who is responsible, and they would guide how countries should respond.
Cohen, unsurprisingly, nominates the US to lead and direct these efforts:
The United States is uniquely positioned to lead this effort and point the world toward a goal of an enforceable cyberwarfare treaty. Many of the institutions that would be instrumental in informing these principles are based in the United States, including research universities and the technology industry. Part of this effort would involve leading by example, and the United States can and should establish itself as a defender of a free and open internet everywhere.
Cohen never explains how this US-dominated framework will differ from existing “international” frameworks regarding conventional warfare the US regularly abuses to justify a growing collection of devastating conflicts it is waging worldwide.
And as has been repeatedly documented, the United States’ definition of a “free and open internet everywhere” is an Internet dominated by US tech companies seeking to enhance and expand US interests globally.
Cohen ironically notes that:
Cyberweapons have already been used by governments to interfere with elections, steal billions of dollars, harm critical infrastructure, censor the press, manipulate public conversations about crucial issues and harass dissidents and journalists. The intensity of cyberconflict around the world is increasing, and the tools are becoming cheaper and more readily available.
Indeed, cyberweapons have already been used, primarily by the United States.
Jared Cohen himself was directly involved in joint operations between Google, Facebook, the US State Department and a number of other US tech and media enterprises which before and during 2011 set the stage for the so-called “Arab Spring.”
It included the training, funding and equipping of activists years ahead of the the uprisings as well as active participation in the uprisings themselves, including providing assistance to both protesters and militants everywhere from Libya to Syria in overthrowing governments targeted by Washington for regime change.
One such tool used in these efforts was described in a UK Independent article titled, “Google planned to help Syrian rebels bring down Assad regime, leaked Hillary Clinton emails claim,” which would report that:
An interactive tool created by Google was designed to encourage Syrian rebels and help bring down the Assad regime, Hillary Clinton’s leaked emails have reportedly revealed. By tracking and mapping defections within the Syrian leadership, it was reportedly designed to encourage more people to defect and ‘give confidence’ to the rebel opposition.
The article would continue, mentioning Jared Cohen by name:
The email detailing Google’s defection tracker purportedly came from Jared Cohen, a Clinton advisor until 2010 and now-President of Jigsaw, formerly known as Google Ideas, the company’s New York-based policy think tank. In a July 2012 email to members of Clinton’s team, which the WikiLeaks release alleges was later forwarded to the Secretary of State herself, Cohen reportedly said: “My team is planning to launch a tool on Sunday that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from.”
Would Cohen’s more recently proposed “framework” have prevented the United States’ use of these cyberweapons against sovereign states to undermine sociopolitical stability, overturn entire governments and plunge them into enduring chaos many still remain in 6 years later? Most likely not.
What Cohen and the interests he represents are truly concerned with is that nations are now not only able to recognize, prepare for and defend against US cyberwarfare, they may be capable of retaliating against the US.
Cohen’s proposal for an international framework to govern cyberwarfare simply seeks to define it in terms that leaves the US with both an uncontested monopoly over cyberwarfare as well as the means to wield it globally with absolute impunity.
It would be not unlike current “international” frameworks used to govern conflicts between nations which the US has used to justify an expansive, global campaign of extraterritorial war stretching from North Africa to Central Asia and beyond.
Such frameworks have become enablers of injustice, not a deterrence to it.
As nations from Iran to North Korea are discovering, the only true means of defending oneself from foreign military aggression is creating a plausible deterrence to dissuade foreign nations from attacking. This is done by creating a price for attacking and invading that is higher than the perceived benefits of doing so.
Nations like Russia and China have already achieved this balance with the United States in terms of conventional and nuclear warfare, and have now nearly established a similar deterrence in terms of cyber and information warfare. For the rest of the world, developing cyberdefense is not as costly as conventional military or nuclear arsenals, making cyberwarfare a corner of the battlefield unlikely to be monopolized by the US as it had done at the turn of the century.
Ensuring that no single nation ever has the opportunity to abuse such a monopoly again means exposing and confronting efforts by those like Google’s Jared Cohen and his proposal for an “international framework” for cyberwarfare that resembles the same sort of enabling the United Nations provides the US in terms of proliferating conventional conflicts across the globe.

"Exclusive: Despite sanctions, Russian organizations acquire Microsoft software","Software produced by Microsoft Corp is on display for sale at a store in Simferopol, Crimea September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Software produced by Microsoft Corp has been acquired by state organizations and firms in Russia and Crimea despite sanctions barring U.S-based companies from doing business with them, official documents show.
The acquisitions, registered on the Russian state procurement database, show the limitations in the way foreign governments and firms enforce the U.S. sanctions, imposed on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.
Some of the users gave Microsoft fictitious data about their identity, people involved in the transactions told Reuters, exploiting a gap in the U.S. company’s ability to keep its products out of their hands.
The products in each case were sold via third parties and Reuters has no evidence that Microsoft sold products directly to entities hit by the sanctions.
“Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and we have been looking into this matter in recent weeks,” a Microsoft representative said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.
“We have robust trade compliance processes around the world to help ensure that our partners comply with all conditions including immediate halting of suspected improper sales by partners, and strong measures to try to prevent banned customers from accessing and using our products and services.”
All state organizations and state firms are obliged to disclose purchases they make on the procurement database. People involved in five of the transactions confirmed to Reuters the software had been acquired.
The Reuters review of the database found state entities in Russia and Crimea that are subject to sanctions have acquired more than 5,000 Microsoft products worth about 60 million rubles ($1.03 million).
The sum is relatively small but such software is vital for many firms and organizations in Russia and Crimea to operate. The database also does not include private companies, so the scale of the problem could be much bigger.
Related Coverage Factbox: Entities subject to sanctions that bought Microsoft products
Among entities hit by sanctions that acquired Microsoft products was Almaz-Antey, manufacturer of the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say a BUK missile brought down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet over east Ukraine in July 2014, though Russia denies its forces shot down the plane.
Other Microsoft buyers, the database shows, include Glavgosexpertiza, a state design agency involved in work on a new bridge from Russia to Crimea and the “Krym” health spa in Crimea owned by Russia’s defense ministry.
The arms manufacturer, Almaz-Antey, did not respond to a request for comment. The defense ministry’s health spa in Crimea declined to comment. Glavgosexpertiza said “the company operates within the Russian legal framework”.
COMPLIANCE CRACKDOWN

One set of U.S. sanctions prohibits the export by a U.S. entity of any goods, services or technology to Crimea.
Other sanctions bar U.S firms from carrying out transactions with companies or individuals on a list of “specially designated nationals” deemed by Washington to be linked to the Russian government and its activities in Ukraine.
Microsoft did not directly respond to detailed questions about specific users of its products and the compliance procedures it has in place.
The products acquired by organizations hit by sanctions include “Open License Program” services, where the user must provide Microsoft with the company’s full name and address.
Almaz-Antey, Glavgosexpertiza and the defense ministry spa acquired “Open License Program” products, the database showed.
Slideshow (4 Images)
After the sanctions were introduced, Microsoft took steps to prevent entities hit by sanctions acquiring its products, according to five sources involved in the software re-selling trade and a former Microsoft employee in Russia.
But people involved in transactions say ways can be found to circumvent obstacles.
The “Morye” shipyard, based in Crimea, bought 150 Windows Server, SQL Server and Office licenses in June 2016 from OOO Web-Potok, a firm registered in Moscow, the procurement database shows. All the products were “Open License Program” services.
The shipyard fell under the general prohibition on transactions by U.S. firms with entities in Crimea and is now on the “special designated nationals” list.
“If we bought directly from Microsoft, there would be sanctions,” a shipyard employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said by telephone. “But there were no problems with (buying third-party from) Russian firms.”
The shipyard declined to comment. Reuters called telephone numbers listed for the supplier, OOO Web-Potok, but the people who answered said they worked for a different company.
Another way to circumvent the restrictions on Crimea-based entities is for the user, when registering the product with Microsoft, not to provide a Crimean address, three people involved in the trade said.
They said addresses in Russia’s Krasnodar region, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea, were commonly used instead.
A supplier who worked with a company on the U.S. “specially designated nationals” list said a supplier and a client could circumvent restrictions by registering Microsoft products to a subsidiary or parent company of the end user."

Dolphins coach Adam Gase on Wednesday defended quarterback Jay Cutler’s role in the Wildcat, James Walker of ESPN.com reports.
Lined up outside as a receiver during Sunday’s 20-0 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Cutler was mocked heavily on social media for not moving on the play and keeping his hands on his hips. However, Gase said Cutler did the right thing, and he wasn’t concerned about the quarterback’s body language.
“Yes. As soon as he steps forward, they can knock the … I won’t say it, but they can hit him,” Gase said. “If he steps back or doesn’t move, now you’re looking at different kinds of penalties. Until you go through it, where a quarterback steps off the ball and starts working downfield and you watch one of them get blasted.”
Cutler agreed with Gase that he was just carrying out his assignment. The quarterback even made light of the situation.
“That’s what they told me to do: Sit there, don’t get hit, don’t touch anybody, don’t move,” Cutler said. “I feel like I executed that one.”"

New York Architects Chosen for Major New London Concert Hall,"Photo
LONDON — The high-profile American architectural practice Diller Scofidio & Renfro has been chosen to design the Center for Music, a future home for the London Symphony Orchestra and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. It will be the first major project in Britain for the practice, which has been responsible for the High Line in New York, the Broad Museum in Los Angeles and Zaryadye Park in Moscow, among other projects, and is working on the renovation of New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the design of The Shed, a new arts center on the west side of Manhattan designed in collaboration with Rockwell Group.
The New York-based practice, founded in 1981 by Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, was on a shortlist that also included Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, Frank Gehry and the Norwegian studio Snohetta.
In a statement, the architect selection panel for the project said that “of the six excellent submissions, Diller Scofidio & Renfro’s visionary ideas offered the exciting potential to create a Center for Music fit for the future that offers access and engagement for all.”
The Center for Music, which will include a concert hall with up to 2,000 seats, facilities for education and training, and commercial spaces, is planned for the site of the Museum of London, close to the Barbican Center, the current home of the London Symphony Orchestra. Simon Rattle, the orchestra’s new music director, has championed the project, earlier this year describing the Barbican as unsuitable for about 20 percent of the repertoire he would like to cover. The Museum of London is moving to another nearby site, a set of vacant Victorian market buildings.
There has been extensive debate in the British news media about the viability of a major new London concert hall, exacerbated last November when the British government drew back from a commitment to contribute 5 million pounds (about $6.5 million) to pay for a business plan. The City of London Corporation came to the rescue with £2.5 million (about $3.3 million) that allowed project to go ahead. The final cost is estimated as $2.6 to $3.3 million, to be raised through private and philanthropic donations.
In a statement, Ms. Diller said that the practice aspired “to make a hub where people want to spend their time, with or without a ticket.”"

There are different types of flowers, and if the website is built and have a consistent reputation for their quality maintenance, you can be sure that the flowers would be fresh and superior in quality. Usually, a store is not very reliable in that way would have quality issues and since the flowers would eventually wilt it is imperative that you get a flower bouquet which is made from the freshest flowers that the store can get.
Types of bouquet
There are different types of bouquet which you can find at the stores. Go to an online website with a high-quality image of the bouquets which they have, and you can get a fair idea of the way it would look. Keep in mind that bouquets of different flowers have different longevity and hence you must maintain this factor in mind when you are shopping for a bouquet. Some bouquets contain wild flowers as well which are not always that durable and may wilt by the time it has been delivered to the place where you want to send it. Also, opt for medium sized bouquets rather than something that is extremely significant since the chances of damage during transit is always high with such bouquets.
Budget and shipping
The budget that you have should be taken into consideration while you send flowers. The price of the bouquets would be higher online than a regular retail store, and hence it is important that you make sure that you get the best value for your money. Do check the shipping methods of the website to ensure that they have adequate and quality shipping options which would ensure that the flowers do not get damaged on the"

Eight birdie Smith upstages quality field at CIMB Classic,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Australian Cameron Smith blitzed the TPC Kuala Lumpur with a flawless eight-under-par 64 to take a one-stroke lead over a top-quality field after the opening round of the $7 million CIMB Classic on Thursday.
Smith, who won his first PGA title at the Zurich Classic team event in May, picked up five shots on the way out and three more over the last five holes to stand a shot clear of Thai Poom Saksansin and Americans Xander Schauffele and Keegan Bradley.
World number four Justin Thomas, who has won the tournament for the last two years with a combined score of 49-under, left himself with some work to do in his quest for a “three-peat” after posting a two-under 70.
Hideki Matsuyama, who passed up the chance to defend his Japan Open title to play in Malaysia this week, is a spot above Thomas in the world rankings and matched his score on Thursday after mixing four birdies with two bogeys.
Schauffele, who edged Thomas by a stroke to win the Tour Championship in Atlanta last month, never looked back after opening with a birdie and then chipping-in from off the green for another at his third hole.
The 23-year-old Californian, PGA Tour rookie of the year for 2017, picked up another five shots over the remaining 15 holes and suggested his error-free 65 had been as much the result of avoiding the lush tropical rough as anything.
“It was boring, which I guess is a good thing out here,” he said.
“I hit a lot of fairways, kind of made an easy day out of it. I tried to copy everything (Justin) did as I figured he’s a good guy to imitate out here.”
PGA Championship title-holder Thomas also picked up shots in two of his first three holes but his round never really got going despite the birdie-friendly conditions.
Two bogeys on his back nine left him six shots off the pace in a share of 23rd but the 24-year-old cannot be written off after erasing a four-shot deficit in the final round to retain his title last year.
Kevin Na nailed a 45-foot putt for a birdie at the 15th and then holed an iron for an eagle at the 16th but bogeyed the last to drop to a share of fifth with fellow Americans Gary Woodland and Pat Perez after carding a 66.
Davis Love III also threatened the grip of the twentysomethings at the top of the leaderboard with five straight birdies from the second but the 53-year-old stumbled on the back nine and finished tied for eighth after a 67."

"9/25 Happenings: Bucs Clinch in '60; NH GM; HBD Dave, Dick, Tony & Vanimal; Wilson, Williams Records,",Warning Something Big Is About to Happen in America the Martial Law Is Coming – 100% Chance it Will Happen ( Red List and Blue List)
US Seeks to Monopolize Cyberwarfare,"By Ulson Gunnar
The use of information to enhance martial power goes back to the beginning of human civilization itself, where propaganda and psychological warfare went hand-in-hand with slings, arrows, swords and shields.
The most recent iteration of this takes the form of social media and cyberwarfare where tools are being developed and deployed to influence populations at home and abroad, to manipulate political processes of foreign states and even tap into and exploit global economic forces.
In the beginning of the 21st Century, the United States held an uncontested monopoly over the tools of cyberwarfare. Today, this is changing quickly, presenting an increasingly balanced cyberscape where nations are able to defend themselves on near parity with America’s ability to attack them.
To reassert America’s control over information and the technology used to broker it, Jared Cohen, current Google employee and former US State Department staff, has proposed a US-created and dominated “international” framework regarding cyberconflict.
His op-ed in the New York Times titled, “How to Prevent a Cyberwar,” begins by admitting the very pretext the US is using to expand its control over cyberwarfare is baseless, noting that “specifics of Russia’s interference in the 2016 America election remain unclear.”
Regardless, Cohen continues by laying out a plan for reasserting American control over cyberwarfare anyway, by claiming:
Cyberweapons won’t go away and their spread can’t be controlled. Instead, as we’ve done for other destructive technologies, the world needs to establish a set of principles to determine the proper conduct of governments regarding cyberconflict. They would dictate how to properly attribute cyberattacks, so that we know with confidence who is responsible, and they would guide how countries should respond.
Cohen, unsurprisingly, nominates the US to lead and direct these efforts:
The United States is uniquely positioned to lead this effort and point the world toward a goal of an enforceable cyberwarfare treaty. Many of the institutions that would be instrumental in informing these principles are based in the United States, including research universities and the technology industry. Part of this effort would involve leading by example, and the United States can and should establish itself as a defender of a free and open internet everywhere.
Cohen never explains how this US-dominated framework will differ from existing “international” frameworks regarding conventional warfare the US regularly abuses to justify a growing collection of devastating conflicts it is waging worldwide.
And as has been repeatedly documented, the United States’ definition of a “free and open internet everywhere” is an Internet dominated by US tech companies seeking to enhance and expand US interests globally.
Cohen ironically notes that:
Cyberweapons have already been used by governments to interfere with elections, steal billions of dollars, harm critical infrastructure, censor the press, manipulate public conversations about crucial issues and harass dissidents and journalists. The intensity of cyberconflict around the world is increasing, and the tools are becoming cheaper and more readily available.
Indeed, cyberweapons have already been used, primarily by the United States.
Jared Cohen himself was directly involved in joint operations between Google, Facebook, the US State Department and a number of other US tech and media enterprises which before and during 2011 set the stage for the so-called “Arab Spring.”
It included the training, funding and equipping of activists years ahead of the the uprisings as well as active participation in the uprisings themselves, including providing assistance to both protesters and militants everywhere from Libya to Syria in overthrowing governments targeted by Washington for regime change.
One such tool used in these efforts was described in a UK Independent article titled, “Google planned to help Syrian rebels bring down Assad regime, leaked Hillary Clinton emails claim,” which would report that:
An interactive tool created by Google was designed to encourage Syrian rebels and help bring down the Assad regime, Hillary Clinton’s leaked emails have reportedly revealed. By tracking and mapping defections within the Syrian leadership, it was reportedly designed to encourage more people to defect and ‘give confidence’ to the rebel opposition.
The article would continue, mentioning Jared Cohen by name:
The email detailing Google’s defection tracker purportedly came from Jared Cohen, a Clinton advisor until 2010 and now-President of Jigsaw, formerly known as Google Ideas, the company’s New York-based policy think tank. The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) In a July 2012 email to members of Clinton’s team, which the WikiLeaks release alleges was later forwarded to the Secretary of State herself, Cohen reportedly said: “My team is planning to launch a tool on Sunday that will publicly track and map the defections in Syria and which parts of the government they are coming from.”
Would Cohen’s more recently proposed “framework” have prevented the United States’ use of these cyberweapons against sovereign states to undermine sociopolitical stability, overturn entire governments and plunge them into enduring chaos many still remain in 6 years later? Most likely not.
What Cohen and the interests he represents are truly concerned with is that nations are now not only able to recognize, prepare for and defend against US cyberwarfare, they may be capable of retaliating against the US.
Cohen’s proposal for an international framework to govern cyberwarfare simply seeks to define it in terms that leaves the US with both an uncontested monopoly over cyberwarfare as well as the means to wield it globally with absolute impunity.
It would be not unlike current “international” frameworks used to govern conflicts between nations which the US has used to justify an expansive, global campaign of extraterritorial war stretching from North Africa to Central Asia and beyond.
Such frameworks have become enablers of injustice, not a deterrence to it.
As nations from Iran to North Korea are discovering, the only true means of defending oneself from foreign military aggression is creating a plausible deterrence to dissuade foreign nations from attacking. This is done by creating a price for attacking and invading that is higher than the perceived benefits of doing so.
Nations like Russia and China have already achieved this balance with the United States in terms of conventional and nuclear warfare, and have now nearly established a similar deterrence in terms of cyber and information warfare. For the rest of the world, developing cyberdefense is not as costly as conventional military or nuclear arsenals, making cyberwarfare a corner of the battlefield unlikely to be monopolized by the US as it had done at the turn of the century.
Ensuring that no single nation ever has the opportunity to abuse such a monopoly again means exposing and confronting efforts by those like Google’s Jared Cohen and his proposal for an “international framework” for cyberwarfare that resembles the same sort of enabling the United Nations provides the US in terms of proliferating conventional conflicts across the globe.

2017 Fantasy Football IDP Rankings - Week 5,"Vietnam Is in Great Danger, You Must Publish and Tell Your Army and Government Now!"
Indian child brides sold in 'package deals' to men from Gulf states,"An awareness poster in Urdu language asking parents not to marry their daughters with Arabs for money at the office of a charity, Shaheen, that works with victims of such marriages in Hyderabad, India, Sept 26, 2017. THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION/ROLI SRIVASTAVA
HYDERABAD, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For years, Haji Khan - a lanky man in his thirties - moved inconspicuously in the bylanes of Hyderabad’s Old City, scouring the streets for child brides for older men visiting from Gulf states, pocketing about 10,000 rupees ($150) for each girl.
Khan struck two kinds of deals: ‘Pucca’ meant long-term marriages where the girl would fly back with her husband to his home country, and ‘time pass’ marriages that lasted for the duration of the man’s stay in India.
“We lined up 20 to 30 girls for each Arab in a hotel and he would select one. They (the men) gave the rejected girls 200 rupees ($3) to go back home,” said Khan, now a police informer.
“The men came with old, used bridal clothes, soaps and nightgowns for the girl they would marry. Most marriages were ‘time pass’,” Khan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Police in the southern Indian city, a hub for tech companies, last month busted a racket involving wealthy men from Gulf states such as Oman and Dubai “marrying” teenage Muslim girls in Hyderabad for the duration of their stay in India.
At the time of the marriage, the men signed post-dated divorce documents, to be delivered to the brides after their new husbands had left the country.
The marriages were performed by a Muslim officiant, or qazi, who forged the bride’s age to show her as an adult. The main qazi who performed these marriages in Hyderabad was arrested last month.
“Most of the girls do not know that they will be abandoned within 15 or 20 days of the marriage. The men would come on tourist visas, perform a contract marriage and leave after a month,” said V. Satyanarayana, a deputy commissioner of police in Hyderabad who is investigating the issue.
SERVITUDE
In the few cases when the young brides did accompany their husbands back to their home country, they were forced into domestic servitude or sexual slavery, police said.
About 30 people including brokers, qazis, prospective bridegrooms from Oman and Qatar and hotel owners were arrested last month and charged with human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, said police officials.
In the crackdown, 14 girls, all under 18, were rescued before they had been married off. Nearly half the brokers arrested were women who had been victims of the crime themselves, police said.
“Contract marriages in this part of Hyderabad have been going on for many years, but it has now become an organized, international trade (of girls), involving agents and qazis from different Indian cities and also the Gulf,” Satyanarayana said.
Girls are easy to source and most marriages are performed after the festival of Eid which agents said is “season time” when tourists from the Gulf visit Hyderabad - which has links to Gulf Arab states dating back centuries.
In the 19th century men from what is now Saudi Arabia and Oman were recruited as soldiers by the Nizam (ruler) of Hyderabad - then a princely state in southern India.
Their descendents continue to live in the city and older generations recall “good marriages” of Hyderabadi girls to young Arab men visiting relatives in the city in the 1970s and 80s.
The trend turned into a business in recent years after a qazi was sanctioned by the government to perform “Arab marriages”.
“They think they will see the Burj Khalifa (Dubai’s landmark skyscraper) and live in palatial homes like Atlantis (hotel) if they marry an Arab. They are ignorant of the consequences,” Satyanarayana said.
SEX TOURISM
Growing up in a one-room tenement that she shared with her five siblings and parents, an offer to marry a rich man seemed like the perfect escape for one seventh grader who did not want to reveal her identity.
“I was 14 and our neighbor told us that a rich Arab boy was looking for a bride. We went to meet him. He was not a boy. He was 62,” the girl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“The broker convinced me that my life would change if I married him. I was promised gold, money and a house for my parents. I believed him.”
She was married in a no-frills ceremony to the man who paid her mother 30,000 rupees ($460). He paid another 50,000 rupees to the brokers and the qazi who performed the wedding - his second such “marriage” in five days.
“The girl and the man had already spent a day at a hotel when we rescued her after his first wife, also a teenager, alerted the police,” said Rafia Bano, legal officer with Hyderabad District Child Protection Unit.
Following the marriage, the family moved house - unable to cope with the volley of uncomfortable questions that their neighbors and friends asked them. The girl resumed her studies, is now in the 11th grade and divorced.
In the narrow streets that snake through the bustling Old City of Hyderabad - where the majority of residents are Muslim - there are countless stories of girls married as children, only to be sexually abused and divorced a few days later.
But government data underestimates the problem - Rafia Bano’s office has recorded only seven cases in the last three years - as campaigners and police say a sex tourism industry under the garb of marriage is flourishing.
In interviews with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, agents, qazis and police said brides were offered in “package deals” of 30,000 rupees or more, depending on the marriage duration.
Slideshow (3 Images)
The packages included paperwork for the marriage, such as visa formalities if the bride was flying with her husband, or a hotel booking if it was a short-term stay.
The police have seized blank nikahnamas (marriage certificates) and divorce papers from the offices of qazis who were arrested in Hyderabad and Mumbai.
“They are rich men from the Gulf and they know people are poor in Hyderabad, and girls available. Since they cannot touch a woman outside of marriage, they marry the girl and sign a blank paper for divorce at the time of marriage,” said Qadir Ali, a fourth generation qazi in Hyderabad.
“They are spoiling the name of Islam for their desire.”
FERTILE GROUND
Hyderabad - once known for its polished pearls and the famous 16th century monument of Charminar - emerged as a major tech hub in the early 2000s, with Indian firms and global giants including Facebook and Google setting up offices in the city.
But barely 12 miles (20 km) from the city’s shiny IT district are the narrow lanes of the Old City where girls often drop out of school when they reach puberty.
Tabassum, 15, left school to help her mother stick glittering beads on bangles that tourists buy in the bazaar near Charminar, becoming easy prey for marriage agents.
Her mother, Zareena, didn’t think she was harming her daughter when she showed her to an old Omani man for marriage. “We are poor people and I had heard of girls getting married and getting a good life,” she said.
But in a rare act of defiance, Tabassum ran away and the marriage was called off.
“This is a business,” said Jameela Nishat, founder of charity Shaheen that works with victims of contract marriages. “The sale of one girl feeds many families.”
Former agent Haji Khan is familiar with both sides of the business.
“I made 50,000 rupees in one month last year. The money is good. But it is very sad for the girls,” he said.
He knows. His own wife was forced into a contract marriage, and was rescued three years ago by Khan who paid 100,000 rupees for her release. But he continued to source child brides for other Arab men until recently turning police informer.
“It’s the games we play for money,” he said."
Mitchell Trubisky’s debut comes at the right time of the schedule,"Mitchell Trubisky’s debut comes at the right time of the schedule
(Before It's News)
On Monday the Chicago Bears and head coach John Fox named rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubisky the starting quarterback. Trubisky will make his first start for the team on Monday night against the Minnesota Vikings. The decision was made after veteran quarterback Mike Glennon lost his job due to poor performance as he turned the ball over eight times in four games. Many worry about whether or not Trubisky is ready to start, but with the team’s upcoming schedule, it’s actually the smartest and safest time for Trubisky to start. Offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains will bear the responsibility of making sure Trubisky is ready to start against the Vikings. Loggains will look to simplify the playbook so not to overload Trubisky at first and will look to run the ball more as well. Expect running backs Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen receive a lot of rushing attempts next Monday as a way for the team to limit long passing situations. The advantage for the Bears the next few weeks is that they will not face a lot of great offensive teams that would force the Bears into any shootout situations to where Trubisky would have to pass a lot. The Vikings have been without starting quarterback Sam Bradford and have had backup Case Keenum start since Week 2. To make matters worse, the team lost rookie running back Dalvin Cook for the rest of the season after he tore his ACL this past week against the Detroit Lions. The Vikings offense only scored one touchdown last week and have been inconsistent as they scored 34 points against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers two week ago. Going into the game, if the Bears defense is able to continue their strong play at home and the offense is able to run the ball, Trubisky will not be forced not to have to go out and win the game. Short passes and no turnovers should be all that’s asked of Trubisky when on offense. Following next Monday night’s game, the team will be on the road to take on the Baltimore Ravens on October 15th. The Ravens got off to a great start winning their first two games, but have lost their last two games as they have only been able to score just 16 points total on offense. Their defense has struggled as well giving up a combined 73 points in their last two games. This bolds well for the Bears again as they will be able to rely on defense and the running game to allow Trubisky to be a caretaker at the quarterback position. The last two teams the Bears will face at the end of October will be the Carolina Panthers at home on October 22nd and the New Orleans Saints on the road the following week. These will be a little trickier for the Bears to protect Trubisky from having to pass as these two team have good offenses. The Panthers were able to score 33 points on the road this past week against the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. The Saints since week two have averaged 24 points per game and surprisingly their defense has improved limiting their last two opponents to just 13 points total. After the Saints game, the team will have their bye before hosting the Lions at home on November 12th. The Bears goal should be to make the game as easy as possible for Trubisky in those first four games. Once they are able to get to the bye week, they can further evaluate Trubiksy’s strengths and possibly use the two weeks to prep him to take on more of the playbook. The team wanted their young quarterback to sit as long as possible, but due to lack of production at the position, he is now forced to play and thankfully the timing works well for everyone.

"To ""Help"" Residents Repair Homes After Irma, Gov't Gave Out Code Violations for Damaged Property","By Matt Agorist
When all logic and reason is devoid of a decision — as in many decisions made by the State — authorities often turn to their only option, threats of extortion backed with force. The bureaucratic iron fist of Miami-Dade county is under fire this week, after providing an example of these threats, for their decision to issue notices of violations to residents for damage on their hurricane-wrecked properties.
One resident, Celso Perez, decided to speak up about a warning he received for his downed fence, only hours after the storm.
The Monday after the storm, Perez was outside with his neighbors cleaning up the damage when a Miami-Dade County vehicle pulls up.
“And we thought he was here to help us or offer some type of assistance with the trees, maybe he was going to bring us ice or something,” said Perez. But there was no help to be given — only threats.
Instead of help, Perez said, “He said he would have to cite me for having my fence down.”
The code enforcer then brazenly walked over to the only part of the fence left standing and slapped a warning on it.
Perez explained to WSVN that he thought this had to be a joke. But it was not.
“I laughed. I thought he was kidding. ‘You are kidding right? We just had a hurricane six hours ago.’ ‘No, I’m not kidding. I have to cite you for this.’ I just laughed. OK, whatever; knock yourself out!”
To those who are thinking that this has to be an isolated incident, think again.
According to WSVN, after Irma, the county handed out 680 pool barrier safety notices and 177 electrical hazard safety notices to homeowners suffering damage from Irma.
Naturally, after this story began taking off in local and alternative media outlets, the Miami-Dade county attempted to clarify their ridiculous tactics by saying it was done for everyone’s safety and it was not a fine. However, residents — especially those who were issued warnings — aren’t buying it.
A building official wrote,
The safety notice is neither a notice of violation warning nor a citation. It is important that we reach residents in the immediate aftermath of the storm, because that is when conditions are most dangerous, and taking steps to protect life is a critical part of the recovery process.
In response to their reasoning, Perez had this to say.
“Give us a minute to breathe,” said Perez. “Let us get our power back on. And I wouldn’t mind if they told me that a few days down the line or due time but it bothers me that they came out here just a few hours after the storm had passed.”
Howard Finkelstein, WSVN legal expert also weighed in on the matter, saying, “This is outrageous. After Irma, people were stressed, they were worried and for a government official to slap a warning notice on them to add to their misery is insulting. Incredibly, it is legal but should Miami-Dade County be doing it? No. The timing was awful.”
Also, while there is no immediate fine imposed with these notices, make no mistake that officials will most assuredly escalate to this point for non-compliance.
This is what the State does.
As TFTP reported last year, residents in Louisiana who suffered catastrophic flooding, were told they had to pay the state for a permit before they could even begin repairing their homes. Seriously.
Considering the daunting expense of rebuilding in itself, those State permission slips make reconstruction cost-prohibitive for some, while others — given the strict regulations pertaining to the floodplain and more — were forced to face the fact that they may not be able to rebuild on their own property at all.
“We haven’t suspended any or our requirements for permitting,” Justin Dupuy, building official for Baton Rouge and East Baton Rouge, told Reason last year in an interview. “Before they start making any repairs, they just need to call in and check with us to see what they need.”
Any homes that needed more extensive reconstruction than simply the removal of water-damaged drywall and carpeting — cases where waters reached the level of electrical sockets — needed a full construction permit from the parish government.
Was the city providing a service by going around issuing warnings for code violations only hours after the hurricane? Or, were they carrying out an ill-thought out plan, which led to the unnecessary perceived harassment by residents, because they know no other way? Let us know in the comments below.

Eminem, who has never shied away from a feud, has made Mr. Trump a target before. In August, during a performance at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, Eminem told the crowd that he “can’t stand” the president before leading them in an obscene anti-Trump chant. Days earlier, at a concert in Glasgow, the rapper wore a shirt reading “FACK TRUMP” and made similar comments about the president before performing his song “White America.” (“See the problem is/I speak to suburban kids/who otherwise would’ve never knew these words exist.”)
But in an earlier era, the two men appeared together amicably. Ahead of the 2004 presidential election, Mr. Trump made a cameo in the Eminem concert special “The Shady National Convention,” which aired on MTV. “I know a winner when I see one,” Mr. Trump said in an endorsement of Eminem’s alter-ego, Slim Shady. “Donald Trump is telling you right now Slim Shady is a winner. He’s got brains, he’s got guts and he’s got Donald Trump’s vote.”
The rapper’s dense, blistering lyrics have courted controversy in the past, with some accusing him of writing homophobic and misogynistic verses.
And this is not the first time that Eminem has tackled politics in his songs: He has also taken aim at Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush. Last October, he released the freestyle track “Campaign Speech,” in which he called Mr. Trump “a loose cannon who’s blunt with his hand on the button.”
Eminem is thought to be gearing up for the release this year of his eighth major-label album and first since “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” in 2013. (A longtime producer for the rapper said earlier this month that the new music was “done.”) In the last few years, he has popped up for occasional guest verses and soundtrack songs — he is featured on Pink’s “Revenge,” out Friday — but has largely remained in the shadows, away from celebrity and social media.
“Sometimes I think that if I get comfortable or set in my ways of doing something, maybe I should step back for a minute and figure out how to mix it up a little bit,” he told The New York Times in 2015.
Other hip-hop artists and rappers have also targeted the president in their lyrics and music videos. The California rapper YG released a single last August called “FDT,” in which he repeatedly curses Mr. Trump’s name. Kendrick Lamar lashed out at Mr. Trump in his tracks “The Heart Part 4” and “XXX.” Snoop Dogg’s music video “Lavender,” in which the rapper aimed a toy pistol at a clown resembling Mr. Trump, earned a rebuke and a call for “jail time!” from the president himself in March."
"How the Great Pyramid was built, if it wasn't ALIENS","Water may hold the key to the mystery of the pyramids.
 
For hundreds of years, some of the brightest minds in history, archaeology, and even engineering have been baffled by one of the greatest mysteries the world has ever known:
 
How did the Ancient Egyptians construct the astonishing pyramids of Giza?
 
This question has perplexed great minds for generations but now it is believed that historians are closer than ever to understanding how this ancient civilization managed to create such intricate and phenomenally large monoliths prior to the invention of the wheel and crane technology.
 
According to Stephen Myers, the founder of the Pharaoh’s Pump organization, the answer could actually be very simple. Myers claims that the landscape surrounding the pyramids in Giza was once very different to the arid desert-style region that we see today.
 
Video series about How the Great Pyramid was Built using water locks and barges:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the time of the Ancient Egyptians, the evidence suggests that the area was surrounded by water and that this water was absolutely pivotal in the construction of the pyramids.

Great Pyramid, Sphinx May Be 800,000 Years Old After Surviving ‘Great Flood’
 
Herodotus, widely regarded as the father of historical writing, claimed that the Giza plateau was once surrounded by water and that the area in close proximity to the Great Pyramid was home to an artificial dock. In recent years, archaeological evidence has pointed towards this description is correct.
 
Sediment laid by water has been discovered inside the pyramids and the Great Sphinx is also known to have endured a fairly significant level of water erosion over the centuries. Furthermore, recent excavations in the region around the pyramid suggest that there was once a canal system which is likely to have been essential for the construction of the pyramids.
 
One of the major mysteries regarding the construction of the pyramids is how the Ancient Egyptians managed to transport enormous stones which were quarried many miles away from the pyramid site prior to the invention of the wheel. If the hypothesis regarding the presence of a body of water around the Giza plateau is correct then this mystery may have been solved. According to Myers, it seems highly probable that the Ancient Egyptians moved the stones from their original site to the pyramid plateau on specially created barges.
 
These stones would have then been moved off the barge and laid on the construction site. According to Myers, the pyramids would have been constructed in a slow and methodical manner with the outer casing stones being laid first, followed by the interior stones. As the workers began to construct the next layer of the pyramid, they would use barges, ladders and rudimentary lifting technology to move the stones into place. They would continue in this way until the pyramid had been completed on all levels before finally placing the capstone on the very top of the pyramid.
 
If this hypothesis is proven to be correct, it would suggest that the construction of the pyramids was actually far more simple than historians and archaeologists have assumed for generations.

"Las Vegas shooter booked hotel overlooking Lollapalooza, visited other music festivals","Here's the latest on the investigation into the Las Vegas shooting:
— At least 59 people, including the shooter, died after Sunday night's mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival. — The motive remains unknown, but police say the attack was ""obviously premeditated."" — The gunman, Stephen Paddock, may have planned to escape the scene. — A note authorities found in Paddock's hotel was not a suicide note. — Paddock visited several music festivals in the Las Vegas area. — Paddock booked hotel rooms in Chicago in August overlooking the Lollapalooza music festival. — Authorities have recovered 47 firearms so far from three locations connected to Paddock. — Paddock reportedly had been stockpiling firearms since 1982 and purchased 33 guns in the past year. — Paddock was seen gambling for eight hours straight on the night before the shooting. — Paddock's girlfriend returned to the United States for questioning. — Paddock was seen with another woman, who was not his girlfriend, in the days before the shooting.
Meticulous planning preceded 'premeditated' shooting
As investigators delve deeper into how Sunday night's massacre in Las Vegas unfolded, more chilling details have emerged about the suspected gunman and how he carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.
Authorities said Stephen Paddock opened fire on a music festival crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, killing 58 people and injuring 489 others — a decrease from original reports, after officials double-checked numbers. More than 22,000 people were attending the final night of the Route 91 Harvest Festival when gunfire erupted.
The shooting lasted nine to 11 minutes, with the first reports of gunshots beginning Sunday at 10:05 p.m. PT and the final shots being fired at 10:15 p.m., authorities said. It's believed that Paddock was the sole shooter in the attack.
AP
But Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a news conference Wednesday night there are indications that Paddock, a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite, Nevada, may have had some kind of help.
Lombardo also said there is evidence that indicates he planned to escape the scene. But the sheriff did not provide any details on what the evidence was or why he believes that.
Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on Sept. 28 with 10 bags and at least 23 guns, including high-power rifles. He set up surveillance cameras inside and outside his two-room suite.
There were two cameras on a room service cart in the hallway outside his suite, one on the peephole of the door to his room and a baby monitor in the living room. None of the cameras were recording, police said.
AP
Paddock was shuttered inside his suite for three days at the giant hotel-casino, perched high above the site of the Route 91 Harvest Festival, which was taking place across the street. Room service was provided at some point during his stay, police said.
Investigators believe Paddock used a device similar to a hammer to smash two windows in his room before he opened fire on the music festival crowd, shortly after a rendition of ""God Bless America.""
Police responded to the hotel room, where Paddock was found dead. He is believed to have killed himself before police entered.
John Locher/AP
Law enforcement sources told ABC News that Paddock possibly set up the cameras to monitor for approaching authorities.
""I anticipate he was looking for anybody coming to take him into custody,"" Lombardo said at a news conference Tuesday.
Authorities also found a note in Paddock's hotel room but said it was not a suicide note. The contents of the note are unknown.
While the motives behind the deadly rampage remain unclear, Lombardo said the attack was ""obviously premeditated"" and ""meticulously planned,"" and that the shooter ""evaluated everything he did."" Investigators are still combing through the life of Paddock, whom Lombardo described at the Wednesday news conference as a ""disturbed and dangerous"" man who had led a ""secret life.""
Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a news conference Wednesday that the shooting ""doesn't seem to have a terrorism nexus.""

ABC News has obtained images from inside Paddock's hotel room. A body, believed to be Paddock's, is partly visibly in one of the photos.
The images also show rifles and bullet shells scattered across the floor, with high-capacity magazines stacked like bricks in a corner.

An employee at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino told ABC News she spent a total of 16 hours serving Paddock in the casino during her shifts there over the weekend. She said she watched him gamble for eight hours straight, from Saturday night to Sunday morning.
He played high-stakes video poker on machines in a separate, ""exclusive"" section of the casino, she said.
As soon as she saw Paddock's picture on the news, identifying him as the suspected gunman, she said she knew it was the man who was her customer the night before the shooting.
Suspect may have visited other music festivals
Officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News that Paddock may have visited several music festivals in the greater Las Vegas area over the past several months. All the venues are believed to have been within driving distance of Las Vegas.
Paddock is also believed to have made regular trips to the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino starting Sept. 3 and through the rest of the month. He was known at most of the big casinos on the Las Vegas Strip because he was a major player who visited the casinos a lot, the officials said.
Investigators are also looking into whether Paddock tried to secure a room at El Cortez Hotel and Casino, at the opposite end of the Strip from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, on the weekend that the Life Is Beautiful music festival took place, from Sept. 22 to Sept. 24, the officials told ABC News.
During the Wednesday news conference, Lombardo confirmed that Paddock rented a room that weekend at the Ogden hotel in downtown Las Vegas. Authorities have recovered items and surveillance video from when he stayed there, Lombardo said.

Officials briefed on the investigation also told ABC News that Paddock booked hotel rooms in Chicago in early August during the Lollapalooza music festival. One of the hotels where he had reservations was the Blackstone on South Michigan Avenue, across from Grant Park, where the annual event took place.
The Chicago Police Department said in a statement Thursday, ""We are aware of the media reports and have been in communication with our federal partners. As you saw earlier this week the city conducts extensive public safety planning and training around major events, in close coordination with our law enforcement partners, to ensure public safety.""
A source with the Chicago Police Department confirmed for ABC News that Paddock had reservations at the Blackstone hotel.
A spokesman for the Blackstone told ABC News in a statement today, ""We can confirm that there was no guest under [Paddock's] name who stayed at our hotel in August during the Lollapalooza music festival. We are cooperating with the authorities on this matter.""
It's unclear whether Paddock traveled to Chicago at that time.
Paddock also searched for hotels near Fenway Park in Boston, though there is no indication that he traveled there, sources briefed on the investigation told ABC News.
The Boston Police Department said in a statement today, ""We are aware of the media reports referencing a Boston connection to the Las Vegas mass shooting incident that occurred on Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017. The Boston Regional Intelligence Center is in contact with our local and federal law enforcement partners here and in Las Vegas and continues to monitor the situation. There is currently no known threat to the Metro Boston homeland security region related to this incident.""
A 'plethora' of guns and ammo
Authorities have executed search warrants at three locations and for Paddock's vehicle parked at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.
In addition to the 23 guns recovered from Paddock's hotel room — which police said were purchased in Nevada, California, Utah and Texas — authorities found a computer and several pieces of media there. Law enforcement sources said multiple loaded high-capacity magazines and a modified bump stock rifle, which allows a gun to simulate rapid automatic gunfire, were discovered in the room as well.
Investigators are still in the process of examining the firearms to determine whether they were capable of firing automatically.
ABC News
Meanwhile, 50 pounds of an explosive and about 1,600 rounds of ammunition were discovered in Paddock's car.
Explosive material and 19 additional firearms were also found at Paddock's home in a Mesquite retirement community.
Five handguns, two shotguns, numerous electronics and a ""plethora of ammunition"" were recovered from his property in Reno, according to Lombardo.
Eric Paddock via AP
Jill Snyder, the special agent in charge at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told ""CBS This Morning"" in an interview Wednesday that Paddock had been stockpiling firearms since 1982. He bought nearly 50 guns legally, she said, but none of those purchases set off any red flags for the ATF.
""From October 2016 to Sept. 28, 2017, he purchased 33 firearms, majority of them rifles,"" Snyder said. ""We wouldn't get notified of the purchases of the rifles. We would only get notified if there was a multiple sale, which would be two or more handguns in an individual purchase.""
Suspect's girlfriend arrives back in US for questioning
Investigators say Paddock's longtime girlfriend, Marilou Danley, who lived with him at his home in Mesquite, is more than a mere witness.
""Currently she's a person of interest,"" Lombardo told a news conference Tuesday.
Danley, 62, returned to the United States from the Philippines, where she was born, landing at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday night at 7:17 p.m. PT on Philippine Air Flight 102.
She was taken out a back way so she wouldn't be seen in public, and FBI agents met her upon landing, multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News.
The law offices of Matthew Lombard confirmed to ABC News on Wednesday afternoon that Danley was at the FBI field office in Los Angeles with Lombard, who is representing her. He said his client is cooperating with authorities in the investigation.
Obtained by ABC News
At a news conference later, Lombard read a statement from Danley, in which she said she knew Paddock as a ""kind, caring man"" and she was not aware that ""something horrible like this was going to happen.""
""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together with him,"" the statement said. ""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.""
Danley is not in custody and is free to go where she pleases. Investigators hope she can shed some light on the motivations behind Paddock's attack.
In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, her elder brother Reynaldo Bustos said he immediately contacted her when he saw the news that her boyfriend was responsible for the massacre in Las Vegas.
""I called her up immediately, and she said, 'Relax. We shouldn't worry about it. I'll fix it. Do not panic. I have a clean conscience,'"" Bustos said outside Manila in Tagalog, his native language.
Mystery woman seen with suspect before shooting
Officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News that investigators believe Paddock was seen with another woman, who was not his girlfriend, in the days before Sunday night's shooting.
Investigators are working to identify the woman and are interested in speaking with her to find out whether she has any insight, the officials said.

Walmart Puts Its Eggs in a Time-Saving Basket: Grocery Pickup,"Advertisement
Walmart Puts Its Eggs in a Time-Saving Basket: Grocery Pickup Seeking an edge against Amazon, the retail giant is pushing a service that delivers your order to your car. Customers never have to step inside the store.

A personal shopper is something you might expect at Bergdorf Goodman or a boutique on Madison Avenue.
Not at the Walmart on Route 42 in Turnersville, N.J.
But that’s where you will find Joann Joseph and a team of Walmart workers each day, filling up shopping carts with boxes of Honeycomb cereal, Cheez-Its and salted peanuts.
The customers select their groceries online, and then the shoppers pick the items off the store shelves and deliver them to people when they arrive in the parking lot. Customers never have to step inside the store.
“It’s about saving people time,” Ms. Joseph said as she helped load groceries into the back of a minivan one morning.
Walmart, which is one of the largest food retailers in the United States, sees grocery pickup as a way to marry its e-commerce business with its gigantic network of stores — a goal that has eluded many other retailers. The company started ramping up the service two years ago, and it is now available in about 1,000 of Walmart’s 4,699 stores across the country.
The initiative is the latest salvo in Walmart’s retail battle with Amazon, and the centerpiece of its strategy to gain the upper hand in the pursuit of consumers looking to streamline their food shopping.

Many retailers are focused on new ways to deliver groceries to people’s homes — particularly in big cities. Walmart is betting big on the millions of Americans in suburban and rural areas who drive everywhere. The company is trying to make ordering groceries online and then picking them up in your car as seamless as a fast-food drive-through.
Groceries have become one of the most fiercely contested areas of retail. Amazon upped the ante in June with its $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods, giving it a major foothold in the industry. Lidl, the German supermarket chain, is also making a big push to open stores in the United States.
Grocery delivery companies like Fresh Direct have spawned a contest among traditional grocers and start-ups to offer faster home delivery.
Amid this heated competition, Walmart has been experimenting with different ways to get an edge. In a few cities, it works with Uber to deliver groceries to homes.
And last month, Walmart said it would begin testing a home-delivery service in which a worker loads the food into the refrigerator , even when no one is home. The customer can watch the process remotely from a home security camera and track when the delivery worker enters and leaves the house.
While these initiatives are limited to only a few states, the company’s grocery pickup is widespread. Walmart is betting that a big part of the country (“from Scranton to Sacramento,” one Walmart executive said) is more of a drive-through than delivery culture.
There is a risk that Walmart’s new grocery strategy could undercut its sales of other products. Selling groceries has lower profits, but it brings customers into the store regularly, allowing Walmart to push bigger-ticket items.
“That is the philosophy of the Supercenter: You put all these other categories under one roof,” said Gene German, a professor emeritus of food marketing at Cornell University. “So if the customers don’t go into the stores, that could be a negative.”
But Walmart believes that the “high touch” approach of online grocery ordering is improving people’s opinion of the shopping experience at its stores, making them more likely to purchase general merchandise in addition to food.
“We get feedback and how much they appreciate the time that we take” in fulfilling a grocery order, said Mike Turner, a vice president of Walmart’s e-commerce operations, said in an interview.
Walmart does not disclose its online grocery sales. But when the company reported its second-quarter results in August, it said online sales, including grocery, had increased 60 percent from a year earlier.
The company also indicated that overall food sales growth had been the best in five years.

For decades, Walmart was seen as the world’s foremost innovator in retail. But even as the company has become the world’s largest retailer, it has been overshadowed in many ways by Amazon’s rapid growth and many advancements.
Amazon’s long-term strategy for Whole Foods, however, is not clear. Amazon must figure out how to sync its core online business and warehouse network with more than 460 Whole Foods stores, many of which are in high-priced urban areas and can be costly to operate.
Walmart faces a different set of challenges and opportunities with its online grocery pickup — which were on display at the Supercenter in Turnersville, outside Philadelphia.
The strategy’s promise is that Walmart can uses its thousands of stores as mini-fulfillment centers, while also avoiding the costs of home delivery. But the store does not always function like a warehouse.
One morning, Ms. Joseph walked through the aisles, pushing a cart and scrolling through a hand-held device that listed the order a customer had placed online.
Like GPS services for cars, her device mapped out the most efficient route: She grabbed a box of Honeycomb in one aisle then a box of Lipton Berry Tea in another.
But when Ms. Joseph reached the peanut aisle, she hit a snag. The customer had ordered a five-pack of individual-size servings of salted peanuts.
There were no more individual-size packs. She checked the candy and snack displays at the cash registers, but there were none there, either.
So Ms. Joseph improvised. Borrowing a colleague’s iPhone, she calculated the amount of peanuts in the pack of individual servings, and then she selected a jug of peanuts with comparable volume.
“Your instinct needs to kick in,” Ms Joseph said. “And you go with it.”
Each substitution is supposed to be clearly marked with a sticker so the customer is not surprised.
Customers order their groceries online and then can pick them up at the store, a few hours later during a certain time window.

Walmart is also showering grocery pickup customers with perks — Easter eggs hidden in grocery bags, a “beauty box” for moms at Mother’s Day, dog biscuits and discounts for recruiting new customers.
It’s unclear how the company will be able maintain this kind of dedicated service if a store is inundated with pickup orders, which in many stores are free of charge and require an order of $30 or more.
Walmart said it had hired thousands of workers to staff the new service across its many stores.
“This is something Walmart could get into easily and quickly,” Mr. German said. “And it would send a message to shareholders: We are not going to be passive. We are going to be proactive.”
Customers who order online choose a one-hour window in which they can pick up their groceries. When they arrive at the Walmart parking lot, they pull into designated grocery pickup spots, which at some stores resemble a gas station with a canopy overhead. Minutes later, a personal shopper emerges from the store with bags of groceries.
When Laura Rothwein of Clayton, N.J., pulled up in her minivan to the side of the Turnersville store, the personal shoppers greeted her 6-year-old son with a treat from the bakery and a bottle of red Gatorade.
A short time later, Sherri Arrison, a retiree, arrived in her Nissan Murano. One personal shopper loaded groceries into the back, while another held out a bright orange umbrella to shelter the food from the rain.
“This is pretty much the only way I shop now,” Ms. Arrison said. “I don’t have to go into the store and keep walking around.”

Marty Just Harbaugh’s Latest Victim?,"Marty Just Harbaugh’s Latest Victim?
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
Ravens fans, I think we need to have a serious conversation about coordinators in Baltimore, and a pattern that has befallen on them. A pattern that that is so specific and dismal, that I am fully convinced this is not a coincidental occurrence on a yearly basis, but a plague whose epicenter sits at the top of the coaching tree.
Unfortunately, it appears that Ravens offensive coordinator, Marty Mornhinweg, is the most recently infected member of the organization.
This plague has a few noticeable symptoms that allow us to make an early diagnosis of the infection.
It starts with a very gradual change in philosophies. When a coach comes to Baltimore with plenty of chatter around ‘committing to the run‘ we begin to question the symptoms. It’s not until we see that alleged commitment has been completely abandoned, do we truly think we have an infectious case.
In the curious case of Mornhinweg, he came into this season with a propensity to throw the ball heavily based on 2016, then reverted in the first few weeks to running the ball- just as the team had committed to during the offseason. Seeing his recent change in philosophy back to throwing an ungodly amount in the past few weeks has me convinced he’s already infected, and will continue to stumble down a path of no return.
The next symptom we like to call “Non-Answers” in which the victims of this infection start to speak in circles, and answer every question with a bunch of sentences strung together that equate to absolutely nothing contextual, or even a cognizant response to the question at hand. You see similar symptoms in politicians, lawyers, and NFL commissioners.
Back to our poor, sickly Marty- he has been speaking in “Non-Answers” for the better part of this season, but only sporadically. It wasn’t until yesterday that he truly began to exhibit advanced symptoms during his time at the podium when pressed about the team’s offensive woes.
Here’s Marty on the lack of time for Flacco in the pocket:
“We all have to do a little bit better on the thing, and those things will happen. I know this: [I’ve] been through this thing before. If you keep working hard and keep preparing, good things will happen. Good things – they always tend to happen. That confidence thing? All-time high.”
And here’s Marty flat out avoiding talking about the play of Austin Howard so far this season, when asked about it:
“We’re happy to have him. He’s going back to Oakland. You know, he was [with] Oakland. I know it’s a big week for Austin.”
One more for good record to show his “Non-Answer” phase is in full effect- Marty Mornhinweg when asked what specifically Joe Flacco is working on during practice to improve his game:
“There are a lot of specific things, and that goes with every position, more than a handful of plays the last ball game – details. It is really every position. [They are] details, and then you end up getting those four, five, six, seven plays in a game that may make a difference.”
Of course this is only a snippet, but 3 questions, 3 instances of Marty completely avoiding the question with a “Non-Answer.”
I don’t see how this can be misconstrued in any way at this point. This is a clear-cut indication that this plague has befallen Marty, and it’s only a matter of time until it takes over.
There are two final phases of this plague that we’ll unfortunately have to sit back and watch as they continue to progress in the much-maligned Ravens OC (a phrase that has become commonplace in Baltimore over the years).
The first being Full Blown Denial.
As of now, Marty is side-stepping the truth, but in due time, he’ll flat out lie and deny it. He’ll begin to use phrases like “Joe is a great quarterback, it’s just been outside factors,” or “this offensive line doesn’t get enough credit.” The fans and the media will see right through this facade, knowing very well that he’s bold-faced lying about the offense.
Regardless, Marty will continue to spew fallacies right and left, until he runs out of synonyms for ‘great’ and ‘confident.’
Eventually he may lash out at reporters, much like we’ve seen from the man who I was patient zero in this plague upon the Ravens- John Harbaugh.
Don’t believe me on the source of the epidemic? Use logic here, folks: he’s long shown all of the symptoms- deception about committing to the run, Non-Answers, Full Blown Denial- it’s all there. And yet, Harbaugh doesn’t seem to make it to the final phase of this epidemic sweeping over every Ravens coach during his tenure. He simply keeps on trucking, handing off spores of infection to each and every coordinator who walks through those doors in an effort to dodge the end result…
The final phase, as many know from previous victims of this plague (Cam Cameron & Marc Trestman being the most recent victims), is the Pink Death.
It comes in the form of a slip, and it immediately removes the infected victim from the franchise, as the plague is ready to move on to its next victim.
Sometimes those infected by the pink slip go on to thrive… and sometimes they fade into oblivion. Cameron made a name for himself as the Offensive Coordinator at LSU following his Pink Death, coaching up the likes of Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry & Jeremy Hill; however, the infection never fully left his system, as Cam only lasted until 2016 before getting the ax.
Jim Caldwell remains as the head coach for the Detroit Lions, and looks to be authoring an impressive turnaround in that franchise’s fortunes. So far, he is the only known patient to thrive following contraction of this disease.
Unfortunately for Mornhinweg, it appears he’s likely to follow the path of those infected before him, and succumb to the final stages of this infection. Believe me when I say all of Baltimore wishes he could keep fighting this plague and turn things around, but it appears the inevitable Pink Death is not far off.
In my unprofessional opinion? I’d give him 2 weeks.
Then it’s on to the next victim.
Keep your head on a swivel, Greg Roman. The Harbaugh plague has its eye on you…

""People are supposed to fall in love with the people on screen and when you fall in love with Indiana Jones you want something from the character. Memorabilia is an extension of falling in love with the film.""
It doesn't stop at cinema, she adds. Ms Nadoolman-Landis also designed the costumes for Michael Jackson's 1983 Thriller music video, which ""everyone was obsessed with"" at the time.
""Michael's red jacket ended up being sold for $1.2m (£900,000),"" she says.
But not everything in the world of memorabilia costs the earth, says Jon Baddeley, head of Bonhams auction house in the UK.
Granted, Bonhams New York sold the piano from the film Casablanca for $3.4m, and Mr Baddeley hopes to sell a Robby the Robot prop, used in the 1956 classic Forbidden Planet, for seven figures at an upcoming auction.

But he says it is quite possible to start a memorabilia collection for free.
""The film posters and lobby cards made to advertise films in cinemas often get thrown away. So why not make friends with your cinema manager and ask for posters or cut-outs when you see a film you like?""
So could today's rubbish be a future collector's item?
An original poster for the 1933 monster adventure film King Kong can fetch around £70,000.
""Who knows?"" says Mr Baddeley. ""But remember, whatever you buy you've got to live with it. Have it framed and enjoy it. If it goes up in value you've got a double whammy, if not, you've still got something you enjoy.""
At the auction, Stephen Lane, the head of Prop Store, gives me a whistle-stop tour of the day's top lots.
He won't be giving anything away for free but says that, in amongst the stratospherically expensive nuggets of movie gold, there are some very affordable items.

""The lots start at £40 to £60. For that you'd be buying crew items or gifts, things like call sheets which were used in the production. It might not be quite as personal but it's still something from your favourite film.""
That's good news for first-time auction visitor and Blade Runner fan, Chris Dagger.
""I don't have a big budget, the most I can spend is around £500,"" concedes Mr Dagger. ""I've got my eye on the Blade Runner crew jacket. I've always been a fan of the film and with the new one coming out, I'd love to buy it.""
The jacket in question is dark maroon satin with the name ""Tim"" stitched onto the front.

""I don't have much chance of getting it,"" says Mr Dagger. ""There are people here with a lot of money to spend, a lot more than I've got, but we'll see.""
In the imposing auditorium of the BFI Imax the auction gets underway. Things don't look good for Chris.
A single grey T-shirt, embossed with ""Peace through superior firepower"", which was worn in the film Aliens, is sold for £3,000. And a full alien creature costume from the same film fetches £50,000.

Chris holds his number ""26"" bidding card nervously, waiting for his lot to be called.
The auctioneer announces a starting bid of £250, and within seconds Mr Dagger is pushed to his maximum bid of £500 for the Blade Runner jacket.
There are no further bids in the auditorium, but there's an agonising wait as the auctioneer checks whether other offers have come in by phone or email.
None have, and to his delight and astonishment, Mr Dagger gets what he came for.
Out in the refreshment area, he takes a couple of deep breaths and poses for photos next to a poster for Blade Runner 2049, the film's soon-to-be released sequel.
""It's such an iconic film and if you're a fan you know all the trials and tribulations they went through to make it.
""And here we are, surrounded by posters for the current film. I'm just really happy, there's not much more I can say.""
With the 22% buyer's premium, VAT and shipping charges, the final bill is £700, which doesn't make the jacket a cheap purchase.
But Chris says it was definitely worth it."
OMG! What She Found In This Selfie Will Send Chills Down Your Spine!,"OMG! What She Found In This Selfie Will Send Chills Down Your Spine!
 
Do you believe in ghosts?
 
Bethany Harvey, of North Ireland, did NOT believe in ghosts until she looked a little closer at the selfie she took with her nephew and her sister.
 
Bethany was spending some time with her baby nephew at home when she decided to send a snap chat selfie to her friends.
 
Bethany sister decided to jump in the background, so she captioned the picture with “photo bombed!”.
 
She had no idea how appropriate that caption really was.
 
Later on that evening a friend came over and pointed out something creepy in the photo.
 
There was a mysterious figure in a purple dress that was seen in the background. She was sitting down with her hands folded on her lap.
 
 “A friend of mine came to my house that night and pointed out what looks to be a woman with her hands folded on her knees in the background, bearing in mind the picture was taken facing the living room door,” said Harvey.
 
Harvey insists there was no one else in the home when they took this photo.
 
 “A lot of creepy things have happened in this house,” Harvey said. “I don’t go into the living room in the dark anymore because I fear I might see something.”

Ford Chief Outlines Investment Shift Away From Passenger Cars,"Putting more emphasis on introducing new trucks and S.U.V.s while also managing the transition to vehicles that lack an internal-combustion engine, or even a driver, will require a dual focus.
Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com, said Ford might find the transition difficult. “Straddling the now and the future will be tricky especially in terms of profitability,” she said.
At an appearance in New York that was also webcast, Mr. Hackett acknowledged that the company faced significant challenges. “The decision to change is not easy — culturally or operationally,” he said, adding that the approaches that have brought success in the past “are really no guarantee of future success” as the industry is reshaped.
An immediate area of emphasis will be connected vehicles, which collect data about their operations and surroundings that can be used to improve safety and provide new digital services. “Our vehicles will be smart and connected,” Mr. Hackett said.
By 2019, all new Ford models in the United States will be able to transmit data back to the company or its business partners, a step toward creating mobility services like ride-hailing and traffic avoidance. The company is planning a similar rollout in China. By 2020, 90 percent of all new models, regardless of market, will offer such connectivity.
As part of that push, Ford is developing software that will enable vehicles to communicate with one another and with sensors along roadways and in traffic lights.

Ford’s initiatives come as the industry’s incumbents are scrambling to match outsiders like Tesla, Google and Uber, who are making big advances in automotive technology. On Monday, General Motors presented a plan to introduce 20 all-electric models by 2023, including two in the next 18 months.
In addition to revisiting its development priorities, Mr. Hackett vowed that Ford would become more efficient, cutting billions in material costs and engineering expenses over the next five years. Ford has average profit margins of about 6 percent in recent years, short of its goal of 8 percent. “That’s not good enough,” Mr. Hackett said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Hackett, a former chief executive of the office furniture manufacturer Steelcase, joined Ford’s board in 2013 and its executive ranks last year. His predecessor as chief, Mark Fields, had come under pressure because of a decline in profits and a sagging stock price.
While Mr. Fields was a polished salesman and marketer, the company struggled to plot a course as the industry was reshaped by electric vehicles, autonomous technology and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.
It was a reversal of fortune for Ford, which had been the only one of the three Detroit automakers to escape bankruptcy as the recession and financial crisis set in.
When he arrived, Mr. Hackett promised to review all of Ford’s businesses and operations, and prepare a plan within about 100 days for improving its “fitness” and strategic direction. Since then, he has said little in public.
In June, Mr. Hackett announced that Ford would import a new version of its Focus small car from China. Ford had planned to build a $1.5 billion plant in Mexico but canceled it in January after it met stiff opposition from Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect.
In the four and a half months since Mr. Hackett’s ascent, Ford has elevated its share price by 14 percent, including 2 percent in Tuesday’s trading session. But in the same period, G.M.’s shares have risen 33 percent, and Fiat Chrysler’s are up 71 percent.
Ford reported net income of $2.04 billion in the quarter that ended June 30, an increase of almost 4 percent from the same period a year ago. But the rise came mainly because of a big profit in its credit arm and a cut in its tax bill. Its auto operations in North America suffered a 19 percent drop in operating profit in the quarter."
Financialization and The Destruction of the Real Economy,"By Charles Hugh Smith
Strip an economy of capital, productive incentives, talent and yes, ethics, and what are we left with? An economy spiraling toward an inevitable collapse.
Financialization is destroying the real economy, but few in power seem to notice or care. The reason why is painfully obvious: those in power are reaping vast fortunes from the engines of financialization–for example, former President Obama: Obama Goes From White House to Wall Street in Less Than One Year.
This is not to single out President Obama as a special case; politicos across the spectrum depend on the engines of financialization to fund their campaigns and make them multi-millionaires, and corporate managers and financiers have skimmed billions of dollars in gains not from producing new, better and more affordable goods and services but by playing financialization games such as borrowing billions to buy back stocks, leveraged buyouts, and so on–all of which have reaped the insiders gargantuan fortunes while hollowing out the real economy.
Financialization necessarily hollows out the real economy, as Gordon Long and I detail in this new video program: The Results of Financialization – Part I (34 minutes)
The key dynamic is that financialization creates irresistible incentives to ramp up debt and leverage at the expense of the real economy. Those who fail to exploit financialization will underperform the market and be fired.
As Gordon explains, if a CEO refuses to load a company up with debt, a private-equity financier with access to cheap Federal Reserve credit will scoop up the company in a private buyout, fire the management, extract immense profits by loading the company with debt, then take the hollowed-out shell public again, reaping another windfall of financialized gains.
Note that the private-equity financiers have every incentive to lay off employees, especially experienced workers who earn higher salaries, to reduce costs before they take the hollowed-out shell public. How can corporations pay out more to shareholders than they actually earned? Easy–financialization. Another key dynamic in financialization is limitless liquidity and super low interest rates set by central banks–rates that are so low and liquidity so abundant that corporations can roll over their debt and actually add more debt and keep their interest payments unchanged.
This dynamic inevitably leads to zombie corporations–corporations with low rates of growth and profitability and high debt loads that in an unfinancialized economy would be recognized as insolvent and liquidated.
As we explain, financialization skews the risk-reward in favor of financial games, so real-world investments no longer make sense. Why risk building a factory in the U.S. or training workers when the pay-off is uncertain, when there are so many ways to reap immense fortunes via financial games that are ultimately backstopped by the Federal Reserve or federal agencies (i.e. the taxpayers)?
As many observers have noted, these perverse incentives have siphoned human talent away from productive employment and into enormously well-compensated but parasitic, exploitative financialization-related jobs.
Strip an economy of capital, productive incentives, talent and yes, ethics, and what are we left with? An economy spiraling toward an inevitable collapse. The metaphor I’ve used to explain this in the past is the Yellowstone forest fire. The deadwood of bad debt, extreme leverage, zombie companies and all the other fallen branches of financialization pile up, but the central banks no longer allow any creative destruction of unpayable debt and mis-allocated capital; every brush fire is instantly suppressed with more stimulus, more liquidity and lower interest rates.
As a result, the deadwood sapping the real economy of productivity and innovation is allowed to pile higher.
The only possible output of this suppression is an economy piled high with explosive risk. Eventually Nature supplies a lightning strike, and the resulting conflagration consumes the entire economy.
I explain all this in greater detail in my short book Why Our Status Quo Failed and Is Beyond Reform.

Five arrested in Delhi over assault on Nigerian,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption African students often complain that they are racially abused in India
Police in the Indian capital Delhi have arrested five people after a video circulated showing what appears to be a mob severely beating a Nigerian man.
They have also detained the Nigerian, whom some residents accused of theft.
The video shows four or five men using sticks to beat a man of African appearance who has been tied to a post.
There was a spate of attacks on African nationals living in India last year, including one in which a Congolese man was beaten to death in Delhi.
Police said the latest incident happened on 24 September, and the Nigerian victim was also arrested due to a theft allegation.
A resident of the Savitri Nagar neighbourhood claimed the man broke into his house and tried to steal valuables from his room, police said.
""It is a case of attempted burglary. Those living in the house got alerted. They caught him and beat him up,"" Dependra Pathak, chief spokesperson of the Delhi Police told the Press Trust of India news agency.
In March, five Nigerian students were attacked by crowds, while another was beaten by a mob inside a shopping mall living in Noida, near Delhi.
Six months ago, African ambassadors in India criticised the government for not doing enough to stop a string of alleged racist attacks on Africans in Delhi."
Facing the Death Penalty With a Disloyal Lawyer,"Mr. McCoy was accused of killing Christine Colston Young, Willie Young and Gregory Colston, who were the mother, stepfather and son of Mr. McCoy’s estranged wife. There was substantial evidence that he had done so. There was also reason to think that Mr. McCoy’s belief in his innocence was both earnest and delusional.
There was no ambiguity in Mr. McCoy’s position, Mr. English recalled.
“I know that Robert was completely opposed to me telling the jury that he was guilty of killing the three victims,” Mr. English said. “But I believed that this was the only way to save his life.”
After the meeting, Mr. McCoy tried to fire his lawyer, saying he would rather represent himself. Judge Jeff Cox, of the Bossier Parish District Court, turned him down.
“Mr. English is your attorney, and he will be representing you,” the judge said.
Mr. McCoy’s parents had paid Mr. English $5,000 to defend their son. They had borrowed the money, using their car as collateral.
In a letter to Judge Cox before the trial, Mr. McCoy’s parents said they rued their decision. Mr. English “is neither prepared nor capable of adequately representing our son,” they wrote. When they tried to discuss the case with Mr. English, they wrote, he responded with a tirade and “insulted us by talking to us as if we were children.”
During his opening statement at the trial, Mr. English did what he had promised to do. “I’m telling you,” he told the jury, “Mr. McCoy committed these crimes.”
Mr. McCoy objected. “Judge Cox,” he said, “Mr. English is simply selling me out.”
“I did not murder my family, your honor,” Mr. McCoy said. “I had alibis of me being out of state. Your honor, this is unconstitutional for you to keep an attorney on my case when this attorney is completely selling me out.”

Whatever its wisdom, Mr. English’s trial strategy failed. Mr. McCoy was convicted and sentenced to death. He appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court, saying his lawyer had betrayed him. The court ruled against him.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
“Given the circumstances of this crime and the overwhelming evidence incriminating the defendant,” the court said, “admitting guilt in an attempt to avoid the imposition of the death penalty appears to constitute reasonable trial strategy.”
The decision relied on a unanimous 2004 ruling from the United States Supreme Court in Florida v. Nixon, which said lawyers need not obtain their clients’ express consent before conceding guilt in a capital case. But the ruling did not address whether it was permissible for a lawyer to disregard a client’s explicit instruction to the contrary.
That is the question in the new case, McCoy v. Louisiana, No. 16-8255.
The right answer, Louisiana prosecutors told the justices, is that lawyers may ignore their clients’ wishes. “Counsel’s strategic choices should not be impeded by a rigid blanket rule demanding the defendant’s consent,” they wrote in a brief urging the court not to hear the case.
Mr. English declined requests for an interview, saying he would not comment until after the Supreme Court ruled.
In a brief supporting Mr. McCoy, the Ethics Bureau at Yale, a law school clinic, said Mr. English had essentially switched sides. “Far from testing the prosecution’s case,” the brief said, “Mr. English seemed downright eager to advance it.”
Mr. McCoy’s situation is not particularly unusual, according to a second supporting brief, this one filed by the Louisiana Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Promise of Justice Initiative, a nonprofit group. “In Louisiana,” the brief said, “a capital defendant has no right to a lawyer who will insist on his innocence.”
Since 2000, the brief said, the Louisiana Supreme Court allowed defense lawyers to concede their clients’ guilt in four other capital cases over the clients’ express objections.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to “the assistance of counsel.” Those words, the Supreme Court said in 1975 in Faretta v. California, indicate that the client is the boss.
“It speaks of the ‘assistance’ of counsel,” Justice Potter Stewart wrote, “and an assistant, however expert, is still an assistant.”"
Moldova PM confident of securing EU funding in 2018,"Moldovan Prime Minister Pavel Filip addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton
CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova’s Prime Minister Pavel Filip said on Monday he was confident of meeting all the conditions to get funding next year under a 100-million-euro ($117-million) agreement with the European Union.
A reduction in red tape and better fiscal governance had already improved public finances, allowing it to get by without the EU cash this year, he told Reuters.
The European Union agreed in June to provide 60 million euros in loans and 40 million euros of grants in 2017-18 to help the former Soviet republic to stabilize its economy and promote reform.
One condition for receiving it was respect for democratic process and the rule of law, the EU added.
Moldova this year introduced a new electoral law that the Venice Commission, a pan-European rights body, said could make the system more susceptible to undue influence by vested interests.
Last week Filip said Moldova would receive no tranches this year, but he was more upbeat on 2018 in emailed comments to Reuters on Monday.
“The EU has a serious partner in Chisinau and we are eager for EU financing in 2018 - we are confident all conditions will be met,” he said.
“What is important for us and our citizens is predictability, including on the EU flank. It’s important not to see the MFA (macro-financial assistance) captive to political bickering at home or abroad.”
Moldova’s economy grew 4.1 percent last year, recovering from a contraction of 0.4 percent in 2015 that was due in part to a Russian economic crisis that hit exports and remittances from Moldovans working there.
Moldova is hopeful that funding will be available next year, “while in the meantime, we signaled the obvious: that Moldova is in better shape and can settle its accounts for this year,” Filip said.
Europe’s poorest country was rocked by a scandal in which the equivalent of an eighth of its gross domestic product was stolen from three of its largest banks between 2012 and 2014.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have forecast Moldova will grow 4-4.5 percent this year.

Will A Strong Finish/Postseason Keep Kris Bryant As A 2018 1st Round Pick?,"Will A Strong Finish/Postseason Keep Kris Bryant As A 2018 1st Round Pick?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Kris Bryant was likely a consensus first round pick entering 2017, but he has been somewhat of a disappointment this season. Granted no one is going to really complain about a player hitting .297 with 29 HR, 73 RBI and 110 R through Monday, though those numbers fell short of expectations. A year ago he hit 39 HR with 102 RBI and 121 R, so he’s regressed in all three counting stats.
Is part of the problem spending a lot of time hitting second in the batting order:
Second – 400 AB
Third – 132 AB
Other – 6 AB
It would be an easy thing to point to, but don’t be so quick. In 2016 Bryant actually spent 325 AB hitting second, 239 AB hitting third and 39 AB hitting fifth. The big difference is that Cubs’ leadoff hitters led the league in OBP a year ago, with a .381 OBP. This year they are 17th, at .326, and that means fewer opportunities to drive in runs.
He’s also played a few less games, while his fly ball rate and HR/FB rates have been fairly consistent:
Flyball Rate – 45.8% to 42.3%
HR/FB Rate – 18.8% to 16.3%
His first half marks were closer to his 2016 marks (45.1% and 17.8%, respectively), showing that the same potential pace is there. It would be easy to imagine a return to the 35+ HR range, regardless of what he does from here on out. If he gets hot it would be hard not to anticipate it.
That alone would help him add some RBI, and if the team gets better performances atop the lineup it would look that much better. With the runs scored being there, kicking in a few stolen bases and a vast improvement in his plate discipline (9.8% SwStr% and a 28.0% O-Swing%) the outlook is strong.
He has all the makings of a .300/35/100/100 hitter, and that obviously is a first round pick. Even as things stand now you could make the argument that he belongs in the Top 12, but a strong finish to the season will lock it in. It’s definitely something to watch closely, and we will further analyze it in the offseason, but for now view him as a viable first round option heading into 2018.

2017 Fantasy Football Team Defense Rankings - Week 5,"Vietnam Is in Great Danger, You Must Publish and Tell Your Army and Government Now!"
‘Revenge Was Sweet’: Trinidad and Tobago Exults in Soccer Victory Over U.S.,"And then there were the memes, mostly mocking President Trump. In one, he throws paper towels over the waterlogged field to his team on the other side. Another takes the form of a fake tweet from the president’s account: “But why do we have to play against 2 teams, Trinidad AND Tobago??? Not fair.”
Darryl Smith, the country’s sports minister, said he spent much of the night celebrating the victory at Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva, in the central part of Trinidad. Ultimately, it seemed, what was important wasn’t whether the island advanced, but rather the drama that unfolded.
“This was good for football since it was nail-biting till the end,” he said. “We haven’t won for a while. The U.S.A. has been a rival since 1989 when we were stuffed out by them.”
Mr. Smith was alluding to a painful date in the history of sports on the islands — Nov. 19, 1989 — when the Trinidad and Tobago Strike Squad, its soccer team, needed only a draw with the United States to qualify for the World Cup.

Instead, all hopes were dashed before a crowd of 25,000 at the country’s national stadium, who watched the Americans prevail 1-0. Trinidad and Tobago has qualified for the World Cup only once since.
“I was 6 years old when we lost to the U.S.,” said Michelline Dasrathsingh, 34, who took her young son to watch the match against the Americans on Tuesday evening.
The crowd was small, perhaps expecting another defeat. Few could believe it when Trinidad began scoring against the United States — once, then a second time — and the Americans were never able to catch up.
“There was singing and dancing at the final whistle,” Ms. Dasrathsingh said.
The D.J. at the stadium blasted the song “Fighter,” a calypso tune dedicated to the Soca Warriors, the last team from the islands to make it to the World Cup, in Germany in 2006.

Everol Bruce, 58, a retired police officer, was still replaying the game in his head on Wednesday. The ground was good for a game that night, if a bit damp, he said. The Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper performed marvelously.
“It was fate,” he said at last. “The better team won that night.”
Alvin Corneal, a local commentator and former coaching instructor, said the victory stemmed from the psychology of the Trinidad and Tobago team’s having nothing to lose. He also said the team, unnoticed by United States, had improved and shifted players in preparation for the game with the Americans.
Mr. Corneal says the team still has a lot of work to do, but the win would lift morale.
As for the Americans, he said: “They got the shock of their lives. I am happy that the U.S.A. should realize that there are other people in the world who exist.”"
Are you drinking enough water to be healthy?,"This feature is part of CNN Parallels , an interactive series exploring ways you can improve your health by making small changes to your daily habits.
(CNN) Water is known as the elixir of life, with good reason. Every system in your body needs it to survive.
""Water regulates our body temperature, keeps our joints lubricated, helps prevent infections and delivers nutrients to our cells,"" said registered US dietitian and CNN contributor Lisa Drayer. ""Additionally, our kidneys and liver work hard to get rid of toxins in our bodies, and they depend on water to do their job.""
Water makes up about 60% of your body's weight, and although you can survive without food for weeks, dehydration can kill you within days or even hours, depending on the temperature and your environment.
Dehydration means more water is moving out of your body's cells than into them. And as this happens, it's not just water that you lose. Small amounts of electrolytes critical to cell function and energy, such as sodium and potassium, are lost along with the water.
You're constantly losing water and electrolytes throughout the day via breath, sweat, urine and bowel movements, so even mild dehydration can exhaust you and affect many of your body's daily functions.
Hydration and your health
You could quickly become constipated as your colon steals water from your stool to keep your digestive system moving. Urine will become darker; prolonged dehydration can also crystallize salts and minerals in urine, possibly leading to the formation of painful kidney stones.
Because dehydration can often be mistaken for hunger, you might gain weight as you try to satisfy your body's needs. Fortunately, the opposite is also true if you're hydrated.
""If you are looking to lose weight, water can help you shed pounds,"" Drayer said. ""Drinking a glass of water before a meal can fill you up a bit and help you eat fewer calories at a meal.""
If you suffer from migraines, studies show that a lack of fluids might easily trigger an episode. Headaches are also likely to last longer if you're low on fluids. In addition, dehydration can leave you unable to concentrate, cause short-term memory problems and leave you feeling moody and anxious.
""When you're well-hydrated, your sleep quality is better, your cognition is better, you function better, your mood is better, the list goes on,"" said Douglas Casa, CEO of the University of Connecticut's Korey Stringer Institute , which studies athletic performance -- another area that benefits from drinking enough fluids.
""We did a study on people who were mildly dehydrated, which can happen within just 30 minutes of exercise,"" Casa said, ""and we found mood was compromised in both men and women.""
Signs of dehydration
The signs of dehydration differ by age group. Infants and young children may not be able to recognize their need for fluids, so it's critical to provide frequent fluid intake and keep an eye out for symptoms of dehydration: irritability or lethargy, no tears when crying, no wet diapers for as little as three hours, a dry mouth and tongue, sunken eyes and cheeks, and a shrinking of the soft spot on top of head.
Adults show much different signs of dehydration, including fatigue, dizziness, confusion, less-frequent urination and extreme thirst, but the latter has one exception: the elderly. Older adults may not feel thirsty but can still be dehydrated.
That's why one of the best ways to tell whether you're lacking fluids is by the color of your urine.
""The morning is the best time to get a global sense of your hydration status,"" Casa advised. ""If your urine looks more like apple juice instead of lemonade, then you're dehydrated. On the flip side, the need to urinate throughout the day is a sign that you're well-hydrated.""
Additional causes of dehydration
A lack of fluids is not the only cause of dehydration. Certain blood pressure and diuretic medications can increase urination, as can diabetes that has not been diagnosed or isn't well controlled.
A sudden and extreme episode of diarrhea or vomiting can remove a large amount of fluids in a short amount of time. Add a high fever, and you could be in trouble quickly. Upping fluid intake is critical.
Sweating due to hot, humid conditions or extreme physical activity is another sure way to become quickly dehydrated. Athletes and those who work outside have to be especially careful to avoid heat injuries including muscle cramps, heat exhaustion and seizures.
Hypovolemic shock, in which low blood volume causes a drop in oxygen and blood pressure, is the most serious form of dehydration and can be life threatening.
The many sources of water
What's the best way to stay hydrated? Drinking plain water, of course, can't be beat. It's readily available and has zero calories.
But what if, like many Americans, you don't like the taste of water? Drayer suggests adding fruit or vegetables, such as lemons, berries and orange or cucumber slices, to enhance the flavor.
The National Academies of Medicine recommends a little over 11 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for the average woman and almost 16 cups (3.7 liters) for men. Though that may sound difficult to achieve, the fluids can come from many sources besides water, including food.
""I often remind people that broth-based soup, as well as other beverages including tea, coffee and milk, count towards your daily fluid intake,"" Drayer said. ""Also vegetables including cucumbers, lettuce, celery and tomatoes and fruits including watermelon, cantaloupe and strawberries.""
""Why don't Americans like to drink water? Because we are conditioned to expect high levels of sweetness in everything,"" said renowned nutritionist Dr. Walter Willett, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
""And that has led to a lot of problems,"" he added. ""High levels of sugar have adverse metabolic effects, and the amounts we get in beverages today is so huge that it is one of our major health issues.""
Willett, who is also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, has published over 1,700 research papers and reviews on lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease.
""You might say we are malhydrated, because we drink so much soda and fruit juice and other sugar-sweetened beverages, and by that I mean we drink beverages that harm our health,"" he said. ""Even energy drinks and vitamin waters, most are loaded with sugar and not worth the use.""
Calculate your fluids
To help people make better choices about their fluid intake, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition's Beverage Guidance Counsel created a ""pitcher"" of liquids to illustrate at a glance how much of each fluid is considered best for optimal health. Though it was created in 2006, Willett, who served on the council, said the guidance holds true today.
The vast majority of your daily fluid intake should come from water. In this illustration, a person on a 2,200-calorie diet would drink about 50 fluid ounces of water a day, which is just over 6 cups (1.4 liters). Another 28 fluid ounces, which is 3.5 cups or just over 800 milliliters, could come from coffee or tea.
""There are health benefits to coffee. Studies show it can help with diabetes and has some modest cardiovascular benefits,"" Willett said. ""It's a mild antidepressant. In fact, studies show about a 50% lower risk of suicide of with three to four cups of coffee a day.
""Tea has about a third the amount of caffeine as coffee, so you're much less likely to have sleep problems,"" he added, ""but we don't see as many health benefits for tea as coffee.""
The next choice in the fluid pyramid is skim milk, also sold as 1% milk, as well as soy or other unsweetened alternatives such as almond milk. For adults who wish to add that beverage to their diet, the maximum amount per day would be two cups (almost 500 milliliters).
""Milk is really complicated area because it comes along with saturated fat,"" Willett said, ""and even low-fat milk is high in calories. Up to two servings a day is fine, but going beyond that is excessive.""
Level four in the diagram includes diet sodas, teas and other beverages with non-calorie artificial or natural sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and stevia. Because there is growing evidence that these drinks might contribute to weight gain, Willett says they should be seen as an ""occasional treat."" They are listed in the pitcher as no more than 16 ounces a day (2 cups or almost 500 milliliters); keep in mind that a typical can of soda is 12 ounces.
Then come alcohol, whole fat milk, sports drinks, vitamin enhanced waters and fruit and vegetable juices. Yes, even fruit and veggie drinks are capped at 4 ounces a day.
""Fruit juices are cautionary because they contain about the same amount of sugar as soda,"" Willett said. ""Orange juice has nutritional value, apple juice much less, so we recommend choosing orange over apple juice.""
Alcoholic beverages are complicated, he added. ""There are definite protective health benefits against heart disease for both sexes, but for women, even a half a drink a day can raise the risk of breast cancer. So if you're not at risk for heart disease, there's no benefit in preventing it, so there's no reason to drink,"" he said. That's why alcohol is listed on the diagram as zero fluid ounces toward your daily amount.
The last category is reserved for sugar- or high fructose corn syrup sweetened beverages such as regular soda, lemonade and fruit drinks. Willett says those get a '""thumbs down"" because they provide no nutritional value and plenty of calories.
Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.
Taken as a whole, Willett said, the pitcher recommendations should come as a wake up call for anyone looking to quench their thirst.
""The most important message is the source of the hydration,"" he said. ""Beverages can cause real harm. People are not dying of dehydration in America, so choosing beverages other than water and other healthy sources has major health implications."""

Review: ‘Tom of Finland’ Is a Portrait of a Boundary-Pushing Artist,"Photo
A biopic can take any life, no matter how transgressive or interesting, and reduce it to check marks on a list. In “Tom of Finland,” a primarily Finnish-language feature from Dome Karukoski, the biography is that of Touko Laaksonen (Pekka Strang), the Finnish advertising designer who, under the name Tom of Finland, published drawings of hyper-muscular, well-endowed men and became famous for expanding perceptions on the portrayal of gay life in art.
While Mr. Laaksonen devoted his life (1920-91) to challenging conventions, the film is committed to honoring them. The movie traces Mr. Laaksonen’s service in World War II, his experience with public-park cruising and discrimination, and his early illustrations of aggrandized masculinity. (He says the pictures would be easier to publish in the Vatican than in Finland, where homosexuality was outlawed at the time.) His sister (Jessica Grabowsky), a fellow artist, suspicious of his sexuality, dares him to kiss a woman in a game of truth-or-dare.
Video
Tom’s eureka moment comes when he visits California. Police officers raid a party, appearing as if they’re about to arrest the gay revelers. False alarm: “We’re looking for a suspect who just robbed a mini mart down on Sunset,” one officer says.
If the film emphasizes the power that Mr. Laaksonen’s drawings held for the gay community, it’s less interested in his reception as a boundary-breaking artist, a kindred spirit to the filmmaker Kenneth Anger, among others. For those seeking more information, the closing credits actually direct viewers to a website."

Washington Post Fails To Cover Amazon Nearly $300 Million Dollar Fine For Tax Dodging,"By Aaron Kesel
The Washington Post, owned by the same man who owns Amazon, Jeff Bezos, failed to cover the recent nearly $300 million dollar fine against the corporate retail giant, blacking out the story that its boss’s other organization reaped illegal tax benefits for 8 long years.
Amazon was ordered by the European Commission to pay the fine after it was found to have received illegal tax benefits.
The commission stated that Amazon received the illegal benefits between 2006 and 2014 in the country without any “valid justification.”
“Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three-quarters of Amazon’s profits were not taxed,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s commissioner for competition, said in a statement.
“In other words, Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules. This is illegal under EU state aid rules. Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others,” she added.
.@amazon tax benefits in Luxembourg are illegal under our common European rules on state aid. Amazon to repay benefits worth around €250 mio — Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) October 4, 2017
“$300 million fine against AMAZON for tax dodge in EU…nothing on Washington Post front page?” Matt Drudge tweeted Wednesday, adding a mocking comment of WAPO’s catchphrase “Democracy dies in darkness.” “Democracy dies…with monopolistic Bezos!!,” Drudge tweeted.
$300M fine against AMAZON for tax dodge in EU… Nothing on https://t.co/XoVevZ1tgf front page? Democracy Dies… with monopolistic Bezos!! — MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) October 4, 2017
Amazon said in response to the commission’s decision that it believes it did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg, that it paid tax in “full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law” and was considering an appeal:
“We will study the Commission’s ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal. Our 50,000 employees across Europe remain heads-down focused on serving our customers and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses who work with us,” the online retailing giant said in a statement to Bloomberg.
U.S. President Donald Trump has previously accused Bezos of tax dodging in several tweets and while on Fox during his run for the presidency last year.
“He thinks I’ll go after him for antitrust,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last year. “Because he’s got a huge antitrust problem because he’s controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing.” “He’s using the Washington Post, which is peanuts, he’s using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust,” he added.
The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017
The @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015
Trump’s claim that Amazon pays no “internet taxes,” is partially true and is therefore “fake news.”
While it’s true that the online retailer built its huge market share via tax avoidance, Amazon began collecting sales tax nationwide on April 1st earlier this year.
The Luxembourg government stated it “considers that the company has not been granted incompatible State aid.”
The ruling is further indication that the EU is finally going after big corporations for tax dodging.
Last year, Apple was ordered to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes, just like Amazon.
The EU authority further announced that it was suing Ireland for failing to recover any money from that fine from Apple Inc.
“Ireland has to recover up to 13 billion euros in illegal State aid from Apple. However, more than one year after the Commission adopted this decision, Ireland has still not recovered the money, also not in part,” said Vestager in a statement. She added: “We of course understand that recovery in certain cases may be more complex than in others, and we are always ready to assist. But Member States need to make sufficient progress to restore competition. That is why we have today decided to refer Ireland to the EU Court for failing to implement our decision.”
Additionally, earlier this year Google was ordered to pay $2.7 billion dollars by Vestager earlier this year in an antitrust lawsuit for promoting its own shopping service over rivals.
While Google also faced a 170 million dollar fine last year from British tax authorities and agreed to pay that lump sum in back taxes for all the years the company under paid.

Yankees Have New Weapons For Postseason Run,"Yankees Have New Weapons For Postseason Run
(Before It's News)
Aaron Hicks came back with a bang last night, robbing Tampa Bay of a grand slam with a spectacular catch in left field. “In the very first inning of the Yankees-Rays game on Tuesday night, Hicks robbed Wilson Ramos of a grand slam. This was Hicks’ first game back from the disabled list since straining his left oblique on Sept. 2,” reported USA Today. Hicks is expected to make a big impact as he has done this season for the Yankees as they head into the post season next week.

“I’ve got six games left and I just want to finish strong,” Hicks said. “That’s what I want to do, and I’ve just got to go out there and do it. I definitely feel I’ve made big strides, but we’ve still got more games to go.”

Another post season weapon expected to make his way back into the bullpen for the Yankees Adam Warren who is another impact-player for the Bombers. ”With the Yankees on the cusp of postseason play, Warren figures to be a welcome addition to a power bullpen anchored by Aroldis Chapman, Dellin Betances, David Robertson, Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle. The 30-year-old is 3-2 with a 2.40 ERA in 45 appearances this season,” reported MLB.com.
As the NY Post reported last week, “Adam Warren can make the Yankees bullpen ridiculous.” That’s because the bullpen, despite their woes earlier this season, has been sensational led by Chad Green, who took Warren’s spot in the bullpen rotation. ”In Warren’s absence, Chad Green has been the reliever manager Joe Girardi uses for multiple frames, and the right-hander has been brilliant. In 28 of Green’s 35 appearances, he has worked more than one frame. In those 35 outings, Green was 5-0 with a 1.96 ERA and has struck out 99 in compared to 15 walks in 64 ¹/?,” reported the NY Post.
So the Yankees have their players in place for what hopes to be a great post season run for them. Let’s hope these newly added weapons are the final pieces of the toolkit ready to take on the American League’s finest for 2017.

CycleBar Westgate West will host Ride for Isla, a charity ride to benefit the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, on Oct. 7.
San Jose, CA, October 03, 2017 — CycleBar Westgate West will host Ride for Isla, a charity ride to benefit the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, on Oct. 7.
The 50-minute ride will be held at noon Saturday, Oct. 7 at CycleBar Westgate West with CycleStar instructor Pegah Olfat.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic bone disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily. It is also known as “brittle bone disease.” The term literally means “bone that is imperfectly made from the beginning of life.” A person is born with this disorder and is affected throughout his or her lifetime.
Pegah is also the sponsor of the ride. Her best friend’s daughter Isla was diagnosed with Type V OI in July. There are eight types of OI and Type V is the rarest.
“Because there are fewer than 20,000 US cases per year, this disease is considered very rare,” said Olfat. “Please Ride for Isla and your donations will go to further research for Osteogensis Imperfecta!”

Workers call on UK PM May to be more visible in Bombardier dispute,"Member of Britain's Unite trade union presents a t-shirt with slogans during a protest outside the Houses of Parliament in support of Bombardier workers in London, Britain, October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls
LONDON (Reuters) - Workers at Bombardier’s Northern Irish plant called on British Prime Minister Theresa May to be more visible in her attempts to save their jobs after the United States imposed tariffs on planes made by the Canadian aerospace firm.
The United States has backed a complaint brought by Boeing (BA.N) that Bombardier (BBDb.TO) received illegal subsidies and dumped planes at “absurdly low” prices, imposing duties of nearly 300 percent on its C-series aircraft.
Britain is confident that it can successfully fight the ruling, which jeopardizes some 4,200 jobs in Northern Ireland, where it is the biggest manufacturing employer.
“We do feel that the levies that are put on are unfair and will be detrimental to jobs in Northern Ireland,” Ron McDowell, 42, who has been an aerospace fitter for 25 years, told Reuters outside parliament in London, where workers had gathered for a protest.
“What we want is for Theresa May to come out publicly rather than speaking behind closed doors.”
McDowell was one of around 20 protesters who stood behind a sign saying “Back Bombardier: Defend our jobs, skills and communities.”

May and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Bombardier in a call on Tuesday, after business secretary Greg Clark outlined to lawmakers the government’s case against the suit.
Britain and the trade union Unite argue that Boeing’s case is without merit because it does not make a plane comparable to Bombardier’s C-series.
Slideshow (3 Images)
May has emphasized the strength of Britain’s alliance with the United States since Trump came to power as it prepares to leave the European Union, its biggest trading partner.
However, Jimmy Kelly of the Unite union said the dispute emphasized how Trump’s protectionist policies might undermine May’s hopes for a good trading relationship.
“I just don’t fall for Theresa May saying ‘well I’ve contacted Donald Trump’ and ‘I’ve phoned Donald Trump’. He’s parroting ‘USA, USA, USA’. And post-Brexit, why would he be changing his tune?” he said.
“So I think it’s dismal days for UK workers if this is the indicator.”"
EPA rolls back carbon emissions rule,"Washington (CNN) When Hurricane Harvey had just dumped so much rain on Houston it dented the earth's surface, and Hurricane Irma was still threatening the entire state of Florida, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt said it was "" insensitive "" to talk about climate change.
Now less than two months since those catastrophes, as a number of wildfires rage in California, the administration is still reluctant to even use the phrase . But that hasn't stopped the EPA from all the while working to roll back a marquee Obama-era regulation meant to curb carbon emissions.
Pruitt announced Tuesday plans to rescind the Clean Power Plan in its totality while providing no alternative, arguing the rule doesn't have a legal basis. The rule was meant to limit carbon emissions from power plants by requiring states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. It also includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low-income energy efficiency.
Under President Barack Obama, the EPA estimated the Clean Power Plan could prevent 2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks in children.
But the EPA's newest proposal stops short of changing or creating an additional rule on the regulation of greenhouse gases and doesn't acknowledge other human health risks tied to rising climates including the increasing likelihood and intensity of storms.
""It's been clear to me that now has to be the time to talk about climate change, that's pretty clear,"" Gina McCarthy, former EPA administrator under Barack Obama, told CNN. ""If people are actually losing their lives, their property, their sense of security because of severe weather events that we know are tied to changing climate, if (Pruitt) is sitting in his office and still writing this, clearly this proposal reflects that he's not engaging with career staff in a robust way.""
McCarthy said that the reversal of the rule, which she played a large part in crafting, shows that the Trump administration is ""just making it up as they go along.""
Abigail Dillen, vice president of climate and energy litigation at Earthjustice, said not acknowledging natural disasters is a clear omission.
""If now isn't a good time to think about climate change, my question is when?"" said Dillen, who is based in San Francisco and close to the Napa Valley fires. ""I'm looking out my window and it's so smoky from the fire.""
Liz Bowman, EPA spokeswoman, told CNN that the decision to halt the Obama-era plan is ""about President Trump's America First strategy."" She additionally referenced McCarthy by name.
""While the previous administration characterized the CPP as the solution to climate change, even former administrator McCarthy didn't dispute that the rule would only reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by 0.2% by 2100, or said another way, reduce sea level rise by 1/100th of an inch (essentially two sheets of paper thick),"" Bowman said.
Bowman declined to answer questions relating to the agency avoiding reference to climate change or the current California wildfires.
Speaking on Fox News Tuesday night, Pruitt said the repeal was part of President Donald Trump's promise ""that the EPA would not be an agency that picks winners and losers,"" adding that with the end of Obama-era plan ""the war on coal is over.""
""For anyone to advance a notion that we should do away with all fossil fuels in the generation of electricity is simply not thinking correctly,"" Pruitt said.
Members of Congress were also quick to challenge EPA's decision to repeal CPP.
Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said in a statement Tuesday evening that the decision ""is anything but surprising coming from an administration that thinks climate change is a hoax.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, referenced natural disasters Tuesday saying, ""at a time when Americans are experiencing extreme and dangerous weather more frequently than ever before, the last thing we should do is roll back actions to combat climate change."""

UAE: Qatar must shun 'extremism' to host 2022 World Cup,"Minister of State for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, Anwar Gargash, speaks at an event at Chatham House in London, Britain July 17, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall
DUBAI/DOHA (Reuters) - A senior United Arab Emirates official said Qatar’s hosting of the 2022 World Cup should depend on it rejecting “extremism and terrorism”, in comments that drew the soccer tournament into the diplomatic row among rich Gulf monarchies.
Qatar, which denies accusations by the UAE and some other Gulf states that it has links to militants, said in a statement to Reuters that the UAE’s charge was desperate and “weak.”
The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of sponsoring hardline Islamist groups, a charge Doha denies. Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous state, have also joined the boycott.
Kuwaiti and U.S. attempts to ease the row have yielded little progress and media outlets backed by the opposing sides have unleashed a war of words that has aggravated tensions in the U.S-allied Gulf.
“Qatar’s hosting of World Cup 2022 should include a repudiation of policies supporting extremism & terrorism. Doha should review its record,” UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter.
“Hosting World Cup 2022 should not be tainted by support of extremist individuals & (organizations)/ terrorist figures, review of Qatar’s policies a must,” he added.
The World Cup is the centerpiece of a carefully crafted strategy to project Qatar onto the global stage via sport. In the run-up, Qatar is scheduled to host events across different sports aimed at improving infrastructure and expertise.
“(The) UAE’s demand that Qatar give up the World Cup shows their illegal blockade is founded on petty jealousy, not real concerns,” Qatar’s government communications office said.
“Their weak attempts to tie the hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to their illegal blockade show their desperation to justify their inhumane action,” it added in a statement.
Although the countries boycotting Qatar would not have a direct way of halting the World Cup, they are major powers in regional sport and could interfere with Qatar’s wider plans. Egypt is the top-ranked soccer team in Africa, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both in Asia’s top eight.
Last month officials from the states boycotting Qatar did not turn up to the draw for a Middle East soccer tournament in Doha and said they wanted to postpone the competition that could be an early test for the World Cup hosts.
Qatar has previously said that the rift has not affected its preparations to host the tournament and that alternative sources for construction materials had been secured.
Soccer’s governing body FIFA says it has been in regular contact with Qatar since the row erupted.
Gargash made his comments after a former Dubai police chief wrote on Twitter this week that the Gulf crisis could end if Doha forfeited hosting the World Cup. Gargash said the official, Dhahi Khalfan, had been misunderstood in media coverage."

Kettering back on the rise?
Media playback is not supported on this device Rockingham Road
Kettering Town have had something of an illustrious history, as the first club in both Ron Atkinson's storied managerial career and Paul Gascoigne's not-so-storied time in the dugout (Gazza lasted 39 days and never managed again).
But despite promotion to the Conference Premier and two trips to the fourth round of the FA Cup - almost forcing Premier League Fulham to a replay in 2009 - times have been hard of late for their fans.
They lost their Rockingham Road ground in 2011, went into administration shortly afterwards and were then demoted to the Southern Premier League.
Further relegations have followed - but now they are back on the up.
Their emphatic 5-0 over Merthyr Town at their current home of Latimer Park - which they share with United Counties League side Burton Park Wanderers - kept them top of the Southern Premier League, three levels below the English Football League.
With nine victories from 10 games so far, perhaps the glory days could be coming back to this part of Northamptonshire?
Ultras return to protest
Clapton's Ultras have boycotted the club's home games this season
Clapton FC have called the Old Spotted Dog Ground their home since 1888. It is the oldest senior football ground in London, no less.
But this season their most dedicated of fans have refused to go to home games in protest at plans to liquidate the charitable company that holds the lease for the stadium.
Fans group Real Clapton FC have also raised funds to try to stop the liquidation process and secure the Essex Senior League club's home.
But on Saturday Clapton were 'away' to the club they share their ground with, Hackney Wick, so the Ultras returned.
Their presence seemed to galvanise their idols, as Clapton won 2-1 to move up to 10th place in the table.
Sir Alex casts his eye on the National League
Sir Alex Ferguson (left) never took a Manchester United side to the Moss Rose
They are top of the National League and on Saturday Macclesfield Town welcomed one of football's greatest-ever managers to the Moss Rose.
Sir Alex Ferguson was there to run his expert eye over the Silkmen as they hosted Ebbsfleet United in the highest tier of non-league football.
Follow Match of the Day on Instagram for the best photos from the world of football.
Macclesfield did not disappoint their illustrious onlooker as Mitch Hancox's goal just before half-time sealed a 1-0 victory. It was Town's fourth successive win and eighth victory in their past 10 games.
If Jose Mourinho starts to struggle at Old Trafford, perhaps Sir Alex will give Macclesfield boss John Askey a call?
The road to Wembley starts here
Moneyfields play their home games just a mile and a half away from League One side Portsmouth
It was FA Trophy preliminary round day on Saturday - 128 clubs vying for the right to make it into the first qualifying round later this month.
While some sides have been there many times before, for others, like Southern League Division One East club Moneyfields, it was their first-ever game in the Football Association's second-tier knockout tournament.
Portsmouth-based Moneyfields have made it to the eighth tier of the English football pyramid for the first time and taken to it like ducks to water.
The club is unbeaten in the league this season, have won all four of their home games and top their division.
So their opponents Bideford, who play in the Southern League's Division One West, were always going to face an uphill battle and even more so when you consider it is a 350-mile round trip from North Devon to West Hampshire.
The Devon side have a great away record in their league - having won both of their trips away from The Sports Ground - but they were no match for their hosts, who raced into a 4-1 half-time lead before Bideford got a second-half consolation goal to end the tie 4-2.
Moneyfields travel to either Fleet Town or Yate Town in the next round, after the pair drew 1-1.

Never mind the football, the stars of Non-League Day have arguably been the furry friends that accompany their owners on the sidelines.
And, while Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp may well have his feet up during this international break, Jurgen the Yorkshire Terrier was taking in a game.
Klopp's four-legged namesake was on a scouting mission in the second round of the Somerset Senior Cup as Stockwood Green took on Peasedown Miners Welfare.
And he was treated to a thriller - Stockwood Green winning 5-3 in extra time after the sides were deadlocked at 3-3 after 90 minutes.

(Before It's News)
by Ray Kuhn
Relatively speaking, Week 3 was fairly stress free. That doesn’t mean there weren’t running backs who disappointed or under performed, but we were devoid of any major developments. There are some situations where tough choices are necessary and there are some possible additions on the waiver wire, but we don’t have anything too crazy this week. With that said, let’s take a look at how the running backs rank for this week:
Le’Veon Bell – Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore Kareem Hunt – Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Washington Ezekiel Elliot – Dallas Cowboys – vs. LA Rams Todd Gurley – Los Angeles Rams – at Dallas LeSean McCoy – Buffalo Bills – at Atlanta Jay Ajayi – Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Dalvin Cook – Minnesota Vikings – vs. Detroit Devonta Freeman – Atlanta Falcons – vs. Buffalo Leonard Fournette – Jacksonville Jaguars – at New York Jets Ty Montgomery – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Carlos Hyde – San Francisco 49ers – at Arizona Christian McCaffrey – Carolina Panthers – at New England Melvin Gordon – San Diego Chargers – vs. Philadelphia Jordan Howard – Chicago Bears – at Green Bay C.J. Anderson – Denver Broncos – vs. Oakland Chris Carson – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis Marshawn Lynch – Oakland Raiders – at Denver Joe Mixon – Cincinnati Bengals – at Cleveland Mark Ingram – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Mike Gillislee – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Tarik Cohen – Chicago Bears – at Green Bay Derrick Henry – Tennessee Titans – at Houston Lamar Miller – Houston Texans – vs. Tennessee Duke Johnson – Cleveland Browns – vs. Cincinnati James White – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Chris Thompson – Washington Redskins – at Kansas City Theo Riddick – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota DeMarco Murray – Tennessee Titans – at Houston Javorius Allen – Baltimore Ravens – vs. Pittsburgh Wendell Smallwood – Philadelphia Eagles – at LA Chargers Ameer Abdullah – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Isaiah Crowell – Cleveland Browns – vs. Cincinnati Jonathan Stewart – Carolina Panthers – at New England Jacquizz Rodgers – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Frank Gore – Indianapolis Colts – at Seattle Tevin Coleman – Atlanta Falcons – vs. Buffalo Chris Johnson – Arizona Cardinals – vs. San Francisco Alvin Kamara – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Shane Vereen – New York Giants -at Tampa Bay Matt Forte – New York Jets – vs. Jacksonville
Notes:
Seven yards on nine carries. That was Jordan Howard’s production two weeks ago against Tampa Bay as he dealt with a shoulder injury. He ended the game with his shoulder in a sling, so it wasn’t surprising when he ended up on the injury report. What was surprising was when Howard came off of the injury report despite news that he had a sprained AC joint. What to do with him was one of the biggest questions fantasy owners had to deal with it, and it seemed like there was no right decision. Watching him last week you would have never known there were any health issues as he gained 136 yards on 23 carries while catching five passes for another 26 yards. Chicago went home victorious as Howard scored his second touchdown of the day in overtime, and while we will have to monitor his health going forward he helped to alleviate a lot of concerns. At the same time there is still plenty of room in Chicago’s backfield for two backs; especially considering that is the extent of their offense. Tarik Cohen wasn’t impacted by Howard at all as he gained 78 yards on 12 carries while catching four passes for 24 yards. In fact, Cohen just missed ending the game with a long touchdown run as he stepped out of bounds, and is a legit Flex option.
One of the surprising things about this past Sunday is that not only did the Jets win, but the outcome of the game was never really in doubt. Just because New York won doesn’t mean we should look to their running game for fantasy value. Despite Matt Forte being the starter, Bilal Powell was the one getting the buzz, if that’s what you want to call it, as a mid-round draft choice this summer but I would keep my distance. Powell was on the field for just 28 of 63 snaps this past Sunday and he only gained 37 yards on 15 carries. Granted he did score a touchdown and had a 55 yard run called back, but for the second straight week he didn’t catch a pass. After not being targeted last week, he has a combined 89 yards this season and just five catches. Forte isn’t exactly much better with 94 rushing yards and 58 receiving yards through three games, but if you must he is the back to own.
While Jay Ajayi has been dealing with a knee injury, that didn’t appear to be the issue last week. Ajayi was removed from the injury report but was just never able to get going against the Jets. Not only did he not have any room to run, but Miami was out of the game pretty early so he didn’t do much. That was especially true in the second half, as he ended the day with just 25 total yards on 13 touches. This came on the heels of a 30 touch effort last week in San Diego where Ajayi gained 122 yards on the ground. He is still looking for his first touchdown of the season, but he should find a lot more room to run against the Saints.
DeMarco Murray worked to remind owners not to forget about him this week. Entering Tennessee’s match-up with Seattle all of the buzz was surrounding Derrick Henry, but it ended up being a pretty even day between the two backs. At least in terms of touches that is. Murray entered the game dealing with a hamstring issue, and in the first half, he struggled to find room to run. In the third quarter he ultimately ripped off a 75 yard touchdown run which truly made his day from a fantasy perspective as he gained just 40 yards on his other 12 carries. Henry, who had one less touch than Murray (15 to 14), gained 54 yards on 13 carries and still remains the better long term option. What is clear is that both running backs have fantasy value.
At the end of the season we might look back on last week as the moment when Joe Mixon began to breakout. He got the same amount of touches last week, 21, as he got combined in the first two weeks of the season and he was the clear bell-cow for Cincinnati. The distribution between the Bengals’ three running backs was relatively even early in the game, but Jeremy Hill finished with eight touches while Giovanni Bernard had five. Mixon carried the ball 18 times for 62 yards while catching three passes for another 39 yards. With Bill Lazor now in charge of Cincinnati’s offense Mixon’s role will only grow from here, and it’s hard to argue with his match-up this week against Cleveland.
With Darren Sproles now sidelined for the season, the natural question is who will replace him? Wendell Smallwood received some buzz last season that he didn’t live up to, and once again he is getting talked up. It obviously doesn’t hurt that the coaching staff has stated Smallwood will see an increase to his workload, but what should we expect from a fantasy perspective? Smallwood is the more explosive back, and after gaining eight yards on seven carries in the first two weeks of the season he picked up 71 yards on 12 carries last week while catching one pass for nine yards. LeGarrette Blount has had an equally boring start to the season, and after carrying the ball 14 times for 46 yards in Week 1, he didn’t have a carry the following week. Blount also benefited last week, as he gained 67 yards and found the end zone. Smallwood will likely have more value of the two as he will be used on passing downs and is the more explosive option, but Blount will take away just enough to keep his value down.

Now that the “Juice” is finally loose, he is looking to score some real action how that he no longer has to take matters into his own hands – so to speak. Former NFL superstar running back, actor and suspected murderer Orenthal James Simpson or as he is more famously known – O.J. – is easing his way back into life outside of the Nevada prison facility where he spent the last nine years cooling his heels. It was reported that one of his first stops was at a McDonald’s restaurant where he devoured burgers and fries after having to exist on jailhouse grub, he got a new iPhone and is planning on soon hitting the famous brothel the Bunny Ranch. Prostitution is legal in Nevada and as long as he gets the ok from his parole board to engage in some extracurricular activity, O.J. will be making a beeline for the booty. One interesting detail, he is reportedly looking to get it on with a hooker who resembles ex-spouse Nicole Brown Simpson who was savagely murdered as well as nearly decapitated in 1994, possibly even by the “Juice” himself who managed to dodge a guilty verdict when his Dream …

5 Stages of Grief: London Caw-ing,"5 Stages of Grief: London Caw-ing
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
Sunday was a brutal day to be a Ravens fan. I won’t even mention the score because it hurts too much to relive.
Luckily, after nearly 48 hours of emotional whirlwind, I’ve completed the 5 stages of grieving and I’m ready to move on. If you’re not quite there yet, go through my first-hand journey below and perhaps we’ll help you complete the cycle as well, my friends…
Denial
First Jags drive for a score… okay… that’s not my Ravens defense, but maybe next drive… again? And again?! This is not happening right now! The Ravens’ first foray over the pond and they are going to not only shat the bed on offense, but on defense as well?! The entire team is out of sorts, clearly something isn’t right because this is not the same Ravens team we witnessed over the first few weeks…
Anger
Fourth quarter and it’s a blow out… I’m done with this game! I’ll find absolutely anything else to do right now… I’ll cut the grass.
By hand.
With scissors.
That’ll be more exciting! Maybe while I’m taking child safety scissors to the lawn I can listen to Stephen Hawking do his rendition of Ave Maria if I really want some entertainment! Because whatever the hell the Ravens brought to London with them is anything but entertainment. It’s literally the worst loss in Ravens history, turned international embarrassment. This is the biggest British-based flop since Beyonce ruined the 3rd Austin Powers movie (yea, I know, I’m harping on it but she was just so awful!).
And the coaches… great job, team! Dean Pees adjusting on the fly is as likely as a regular-season Ravens game without an injury to a starter. Joe Flacco is more likely to not throw a pick than Pees rush more than 3 at any critical point in the game. I heard Ben & Jerry’s is making a Dean Pees-flavored ice cream; it’s basically just vanilla, with some nuts thrown in.
Marty Mohrninweg doesn’t get off that easy either! No in-game adjustments when you see the Jags pinning their ears back, honing in, and getting instant pressure on Flacco. It was almost as if Marty threw in the towel and accepted defeat, assuming this game didn’t count because it’s international.
Chumps. All of them. What a piss poor excuse of a game from play on the field, to execution, to coaching.
Bargaining
So many ways this pummeling over the pond could have been avoided…
Why couldn’t the Ravens brass just go out and get legit coordinators this offseason instead of defining insanity and hoping for improved results with the failures from 2016?
Why couldn’t the coaching staff even make a smidge of an adjustment throughout the game?
Why couldn’t the team have focused more efforts of the million-dollar question of ‘why do all of our players get hurt at a higher rate than any other NFL team?’
And really look at those injuries… what could have happened had this team been healthy instead of 17 players done for the season? And that’s outside of Zach Orr‘s retirement and Dennis Pitta‘s 3rd hip injury…
If only the team actually hadn’t needed to play all of those backups, perhaps the results would have been different…
Depression
Let’s be honest here… the season is done.
We beat two awful teams in the first two weeks, then we lost to an ‘average at best’ team in the Jags. Can we just go ahead and say 2 more wins against Cleveland and Cincy again, then… yea, that might be about it. So 4-12? Sound about right?
But of course none of that will matter, because just like this past offseason, Steve Biscotti will clamp down on any chatter about firing coaches, and instead will re-up Harbaugh, then keep Pees/Marty on board, claiming injuries were the only reason this team fell apart.
Rinse & repeat.
Then they’ll defer more contracts to sign more veteran players, push more money into future years, and when they finally decide to rebuild? They’ll have half of the cap allocated to guys who are no longer on the team.
Typical…
Acceptance
So, here’s the thing: It’s one game. And maybe? Just maybe that game was a fluke.
I don’t believe we are a true Super Bowl contender given the spattering of injuries, and I think to assume the Ravens are a playoff team is still borderline. But I do believe if the Ravens played the Jags 9 more times, there would never be another game nearly as bad as that one, nor will the final score of the remaining 13 games on their schedule be that gross. I believe Sunday’s game – on offense and defense – was a true anomaly, and if anything it pissed the Ravens off.
They’re angry.
They’re not going to sit back and accept defeat.
They’ll come out of the gates hot against the Steelers this week.
At least I hope so!
And honestly? Maybe this is exactly what the team needed- an early season blowout.
If they right the ship? The team has plenty of time to redeem themselves.
If they simply don’t have the replacement level talent to maintain? They have a poor season & start from scratch in 2018 with a high draft pick and plenty of offensive talent ripe for the picking.
If the coaches refuse to make adjustments? Marty and Dean likely have pink slips waiting sooner rather than later, while Harbaugh’s seat gets hotter by the second, possibly leading to the unemployment line.
These are really the only options, but ultimately, how will we know until next week is played? No sense in getting worked up, just accept last week’s results, and move on to Steelers Week!

"With iPhone’s New FaceID, Cops Can Unlock Your Phone by Pointing at Your Face-While You’re Cuffed","By Matt Agorist
On Tuesday, the world watched as Apple unveiled their tenth-anniversary special edition iPhone, the iPhone X. While iPhone boasts a newer more secure phone—using its patented new facial recognition system—Internet sleuths were quick to point out the ominous implications behind the new tech.
As RT reports, the iPhone X replaces the iconic “home” button, featured on all previous versions, with a new “TrueDepth camera system.” A little black bar at the top of the phone contains several sensors, cameras, and even a dot projector that all work together to create a mathematical 3D model of the owner’s face.
However, there are some ways this technology can actually be used against you.
Imagine for a moment, you are one of the countless individuals who just filmed a gruesome act of police brutality. Many of those countless individuals, as TFTP has frequently reported, have found themselves subject to unlawful detainment and illegal search and seizure as cops attempt to erase any evidence of their wrongdoing. Now, imagine that the only thing standing in the way of a coverup of an innocent person being killed by police is the password on your phone to protect the video from police deleting it.
A secure phone, at this moment, is the only thing that can protect the documented evidence of criminal behavior. Luckily—for the police—if you have a new iPhone X, all they theoretically need to do is to handcuff you and point it at your face. Now they have access to all of your private information.
Think police won’t try to delete your video? Think again.
Just last week, in an exclusive report, TFTP exposed a case of alleged deleted evidence in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, after a police officer killed a deaf electrical engineer. A security guard said he watched and filmed police kill Josh Cloud—an account which differs greatly from the official story—and he was detained and his video deleted.
Had his phone been locked and had the security guard resisted alleged police pressure to confiscate his phone, evidence of a police murder may still exist. However, if he had an iPhone X, even if he would’ve resisted, they need only point it at his face.
“With the iPhone X, your iPhone is locked until you look at it and it recognizes you. Nothing has ever been more simple, natural and effortless,” Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing said in his keynote speech Tuesday. “This is the future of how we’ll unlock our smartphones and protect our sensitive information.”
However, as many have pointed out, this simplicity is the device’s potential downfall.
#FaceID
Good: Design looks surprisingly robust, already has a panic disable.
Bad: Normalizes facial scanning, a tech certain to be abused. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 12, 2017
This abuse, as Snowden points out, can come in many forms.
With FaceID, cops can just point your phone at your face while they have you in handcuffs then look through your phone without a warrant. — Jerrah Mormont (@BostonJerry) September 12, 2017 FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad)
While some folks expressed concern that the iPhone X will allow someone to unlock your iPhone while you sleep, Apple directly countered that claim, noting that the feature will only work when the user looks at the device with their eyes open. Schiller also explained that FaceID will recognize a user even when they change their hairstyle, put on glasses, wear a hat or change their appearance in other ways—perhaps when an unconscious person has their eyes pulled open.
The good news, however, is that while this technology has these ominous implications for abuse, it is far more secure than any of the previous devices. According to Schiller, the Touch ID had a false unlock rate of one in 50,000, whereas the new FaceID only had an error rate of one in 1 million.
Apple also has an extensive history of resisting the police state attempts at creating back doors to their technology. Just last year, in a landmark case, Apple refused to help the government break the law and allow for the various spy agencies to monitor iPhone users with a special decryption key for the State.
Had the government successfully forced Apple into unlocking the phone or creating a backdoor to their encryption, experts in the technology field warned that this could be the end of privacy as we know it. For now, however, privacy is still winning—that is, until we see the first case of police unlocking an iPhone X by pointing at a handcuffed person’s face.

China to Debtors: Pay Up or Be Shamed,"“This is a step toward a credit society,” Mr. Hu said.
Mortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans are a relatively new, but increasingly popular, development in China. Chinese lenders and officials have turned to unfamiliar and sometimes unorthodox ways to determine creditworthiness, including tracking cellphone use and counting toothbrushes in people’s bathrooms.
On a broader level, China has ambitions to establish a social credit system to track personal behavior. That goal, while technically challenging, is increasingly possible as China invests in artificial intelligence and as more people turn to online platforms for even the smallest transactions. Officials hope the new platforms will become a one-stop clearinghouse to help the local authorities expose those names and pressure them to make good on their debts.
China’s latest effort is unlikely to address the country’s current debt problems. Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s both reduced their ratings for China this year, citing the debt binge. Most borrowing has been done by state-owned enterprises and local governments to help sustain China’s growth levels.
Large state-owned enterprises, widely viewed as too big to fail because of the employment they provide, have avoided defaults. That is in large part because they continue to get large loans from state-controlled banks, sometimes to help repay previous loans. Defaults by state-controlled companies have been extremely rare and confined to smaller firms.

The reports said that China’s banking regulator, the Supreme Court and the propaganda arm of the Communist Party had told local officials to complete the platforms by the end of the year and to make the public aware of the websites within two years. The China Banking Regulatory Commission declined to comment on Wednesday.
A possible model for the databases is one already maintained online by the Supreme Court, which mainly catalogs individuals, although it does include some companies and even a few small local governments. That database is based on debtors who have been sued and lost their cases in China, particularly in the more important courts in China’s judicial system.
The court announced in June that it had published more than seven million names of defaulters. The database has been used to put pressure on deadbeats by making it hard for them to travel. According to the Supreme Court, the database has already been used to block the sale of more than seven million plane tickets and nearly three million high-speed train tickets.
Banks and other lenders regularly check the Supreme Court database, but they do not add their own data on late or disputed payments, and they share very little data with one another.

China’s online giants were not mentioned in official news reports about the plans, but experts say they are likely to play a major role in the establishment of nationwide credit-scoring systems. Ant Financial — an affiliate of the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant that trades in the United States — said it had set up its own credit rating system, Sesame Credit, which monitors the Supreme Court database without contributing to it.
“Sesame Credit does not share user information with any third party without the consent of users,” Ant Financial said on Wednesday. It declined to comment on the details of the move toward local and provincial databases.
Chinese bankers say that the default rate for individual borrowers is very low in China, and that lenders have usually demanded a car or apartment as collateral before making the loan. The bulk of household lending in China consists of home mortgages, according to data from China’s central bank. Personal loans are limited but rising, the data showed."

I see Wasps Ladies recently signed England internationals Amy Cokayne, Harriet Millar Mills and Justine Lucas, all of whom previously turned out for Lichfield Ladies.
What seems to be forgotten amidst all the justified hype and excitement surrounding the heady opening weeks of the Premier 15s – England’s new elite domestic rugby competition for women – is the fate of Lichfield Ladies.
A seemingly permanent fixture in the Women’s Premiership in England for several years (finishing in 3rd place last season), Lichfield have over the years developed many international players, including the three women mentioned above as well as current England skipper Sarah Hunter, Emily Scarratt, Natasha Hunt and Vicky Fleetwood.
Lichfield, however, failed to be included in the Premier 15s following an RFU tender process that effectively replaced them with Loughborough Lightning (Loughborough University) who, prior to this process, had never had a team in women’s league rugby.
As a result Lichfield has lost around 30 players, many of whom have had to move to top-flight clubs in order to be considered for international selection and several of whom have joined Loughborough.
I have read the judgment of the panel that dismissed Lichfield’s appeal against the RFU decision. Suffice it to say that the process was not exactly transparent and the judgment brushes over the fact that Nicky Ponsford, the RFU’s Head of Women’s Performance, was part of the decision making process.
Nicky Ponsford is an alumni and former coach of Loughborough University.
Just saying.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will get closer to the heavens this month when he puts in a call to the International Space Station.
The Vatican said on Monday the pope would make the call at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) on October 26. It gave no further details, but Francis has supported the work of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which regularly brings together scientists from around the world to exchange views on topics such as climate change.

By Bryan Dietzler
The Chicago Bears will face their biggest rival, the Green Bay Packers, at Lambeau Field this Thursday night in Green Bay. The following is a quick review of the injury report for both the Bears and Packers and what each injury means to both teams.
Chicago Bears
Tom Compton-OT/G-Compton practiced in full on Monday and appears to be ready for the game. The Bears may need his services Thursday.
Quintin Demps-SS-He will be out with a broken forearm for this and the next few games. Adrian Amos, last year’s starter at free safety, will take his place.
Hroniss Grasu-C-Grasu has been limited in practice all week with a hand injury and is questionable for tonight’s game. If he is out, that tightens up the depth at the center position and may force some reshuffling.
Nick Kwiatkoski-LB-After tearing his pectoral muscle against the Buccaneers, he won’t be available for this game leaving Christian Jones and John Timu to man his position. Hopefully, they will be able to continue to step up.
Josh Sitton-RG-Sitton did not play in last week’s game and was limited in practice this week with a rib injury. Consider him a game-time decision that could cause some reshuffling on the offensive line for the second week in a row.
Akiem Hicks-DE-Hicks was just added to the injury report with a foot injury and is listed as questionable. Hopefully, he plays because the Bears need his leadership and pass rush ability tonight. With Aaron Rodgers being one of the most mobile quarterbacks in the league, getting a lot of a pass pressure on him and getting him down is a must.
Overall, surprisingly, the Bears aren’t as banged too terribly but the possibility of having Hicks out is concerning. Hopefully, he will be able to play.
Green Bay Packers
Davon House-CB-House will be out of the lineup with a quad injury tonight. House, the Packers starter at left corner, will be missed. This means that Quintin Rollins will likely have to step in and play tonight.
David Bakhtiari-OT– After a week of limited participation in practice, he is listed as doubtful with a hamstring injury going into the game tonight. Should he not be able to play, Adam Pankey will take his place.
Bryan Bulaga-OT-Bulaga, the tackle opposite Bakhtiari, is also listed as doubtful and will probably be out for Thursday’s game. Having both of their offensive tackles out tonight is not good for Green Bay. Hopefully, Chicago’s pass rush will be able to take advantage of this and get a lot of pass pressure on Rodgers. If Bulaga can’t play then the Packers will have to do some switching around to make things work.
Mike Daniels-DT-Daniels has a hip injury and has been limited in practice all week. It’s not known yet if he will play and if he can’t then Montravious Adams should take his place.
Nick Perry-LB-Perry enters the game as questionable but practiced in full after starting the week limited. It appears as if he is a go but if he can’t go then Kyler Fackrell will get the starting nod.
The Packers had five other players who started out the week limited in practice but ended it with no limitations. They were:
Safety Kentrell Rice with a groin injury.
Wide receiver Randall Cobb with a chest injury.
Running back Ty Montgomery with a wrist injury.
Linebacker Jake Ryan with a hamstring and a concussion issue.
Defensive tackle Quinton Dial with a chest injury.
Green Bay may have some critical pieces of their offensive line missing in this game so Chicago needs to take advantage of that. They need to rush Rodgers, contain him and not let him make plays with his feet. That will be easier with Bulaga and Bakhtiari out.
Hopefully, that will help even things up a little bit.
Score Prediction: Green Bay 21 Chicago 17

"Africa tops global hunger index, driven by war and climate shocks","ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Global hunger has fallen more than a quarter since 2000, but conflict and climate shocks are beginning to reverse these gains, an annual global hunger index said on Thursday.
Nearly half of the 119 countries surveyed had “serious”, “alarming” or “extremely alarming” hunger levels between 2012 and 2016, with war-torn Central African Republic worst affected, followed by Chad, Sierra Leone, Madagascar and Zambia.
“Conflict and climate-related shocks are at the heart of this problem,” said Dominic MacSorley, chief executive of Concern, which compiled the report along with the International Food Policy Research Institute and Welthungerhilfe.
About half of the populations in the hungriest countries were short of food, it said.
South Sudan and Somalia, which are at risk of renewed famine, were among 13 countries excluded from the index due to lack of data.
The United Nations said last month that global hunger levels have risen for the first time in more than a decade, now affecting 11 percent of the world’s population - or 815 million people.
Famine struck parts of South Sudan earlier this year, and there is a high risk that it could return there - and develop in other countries hit by conflict: northeast Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen, the U.N. said.
Yemen came sixth in the index as its hunger crisis has spiked since 2015 when civil war erupted and the data covers the period 2012 to 2016.
Although most of Nigeria is relatively food secure, the eight-year Islamist Boko Haram insurgency has left millions in the northeast at risk of starvation.
“We must build the resilience of communities on the ground, but we must also bolster public and political solidarity internationally,” MacSorley said in a statement.
The survey found that 14 countries – including Senegal, Azerbaijan, Peru, Panama, Brazil and China – have made significant improvements since 2000.
The index is based on levels of hunger in the general population, and rates of wasting, stunting and deaths among children under five years old.
Women, girls and ethnic minorities are most at risk of hunger, which causes nearly half of deaths in under fives, it said.
“The world needs to act as one community with the shared goal of ensuring not a single child goes to bed hungry each night and no-one is left behind,” MacSorley said."

World Boxing Super Series: Chris Eubank Jr knocks out Avni Yildirim in round three,"Eubank Jr landed 59 punches to Yildirim's 23
Britain's Chris Eubank Jr produced a stunning third-round knockout to defeat Turkey's Avni Yildirim in the super-middleweight World Boxing Super Series.
The 28-year-old will face a semi-final against WBA champion George Groves or fellow Briton Jamie Cox, who meet at Wembley Arena on 14 October.
Eubank Jr, beaten only once in his previous 26 bouts, put the undefeated Yildirim, 26, on one knee in round one.
After a flurry of punches, a crunching left hook provided the knockout blow.
Following his emphatic victory, Eubank Jr said: ""I'm here to dominate this tournament. I'm sending a message out there that I'm coming. George Groves, get through your next fight so we can give the boxing fans what they want to see.
""I think it's going to be exactly the same as what we saw tonight. I'm not playing any more.""
Asked about Yildirim, the Briton added: ""He was a strong, come-forward fighter - but the experience is not there for him.
""He was 16-0 but he has to work technically on his abilities to compete with a fighter like me.""
Trouble mars contest
Trouble broke out in the crowd before the Eubank Jr-Yildirim bout
The contest took place at the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer Halle in Stuttgart, Germany, and before the fighters took to the ring there was briefly trouble among rival fans.
Chairs and punches were thrown and pictures posted on social media showed some men left bloodied.
Journalist Declan Taylor, who was covering the fight, posted on social media: ""Mass brawl has just broken out literally 10ft from press row. Chairs over people's heads, the lot.""
What is the World Boxing Super Series?
The World Boxing Super Series has been described as the ""Champions League of boxing"" with two tournaments, one for cruiserweights and one for super-middleweights.
Each category offers a $25m (£19m) prize fund and a trophy named after late boxing great Muhammad Ali, with the winner of each expected to receive $10m (£7.6m) in total over the three victories needed to land the title.
World championship belts are also on the line in the new event so Eubank Jr, who weighed in a pound under the 12st limit recorded by his opponent, remains IBO world super-middleweight champion.
Eubank Jr's only defeat was a controversial split-decision loss to compatriot Billy Joe Saunders at middleweight in November 2014."

Mental health concerns in aftermath of Puerto Rico hurricane,"Locked out of his home and with nowhere else to go, Wilfredo Ortiz Marrero rode out Hurricane Maria inside a Jeep, which was lifted off its wheels by floodwaters in the parking lot. He then endured days without enough food or running water.
The lights are back on at his residence for low-income elderly people in the San Juan suburb of Trujillo Alto, and food has started arriving, but he still waits as long as he can each night to leave the company of others in the lobby. Alone in his room, he sometimes starts to shake.
""You get really depressed,"" he said Wednesday.
The hurricane that pummeled Puerto Rico two weeks ago and the scarcity-marked aftermath are taking a toll on islanders' equilibrium. The U.S. territory's government counted two suicides among the death toll, which now stands at 34, and with many communities still waiting for power and clean water, there is concern about others reaching a breaking point.
Students and staff at Ponce Health Sciences University are visiting shelters and people in the hardest-hit communities to provide psychological help, among other services, said Alex Ruiz, special assistant to the university's president.
""People's whole worlds were taken from them,"" he said. ""People will need the proper psychological help to get through this.""
At a news conference on Wednesday, Gov. Ricardo Rossello said the death toll jumped to 34 from 16 on the basis of a report that he commissioned to consult with hospitals and gain a more complete picture of the number of victims. He said 20 deaths resulted directly from the storm, including drownings and those killed in mudslides.
The count also includes sick and elderly who died in the aftermath of the hurricane, including some who died because oxygen could not be delivered amid power outages. There were also two suicides, but Rossello did not provide details of those.
One elderly woman took her own life Sunday inside a nursing home in Rio Piedras, another San Juan suburb. While the facility's director, Maria Betancourt, said she didn't believe the woman was distressed about the storm, the home was stifling hot on Wednesday after power was wiped out nearly a month ago when Hurricane Irma sideswiped the island on Sept. 7, though a generator has kept the lights on. Outside the home there were piles of garbage and fallen tree limbs piled on the side of the road.
Ortiz and other residents of the low-income housing residence in Trujillo Alto said the building administration ordered them to leave ahead of Hurricane Maria, saying the building wasn't equipped to weather the storm. Some were picked up by family, but Ortiz had no relatives to come get him and had no choice but to stay in his Jeep until the storm subsided and a chain on the building's door was removed.
Another resident, Felix Manuel Lopez, a 73-year-old U.S. Army veteran, said he has seen a Veterans Affairs counselor to help with anxiety that came back after he returned from a shelter to his darkened apartment.
""Everybody's drained,"" said Ruiz, the Ponce university official, who recently toured the city on the island's southern coast to assess people's needs. ""Spirits have been broken.""
On Wednesday, the governor said power has been restored to 8.6 percent of Puerto Rico's customers and the government is hoping to have power back on for 25 percent within a month. Power is being restored at hospitals, and he said the government is looking into which schools can reopen.
""While we are still in an emergency we are transitioning to establishing some components of normalcy,"" Rossello said.
Dr. Olga Rodriguez, the dean of the Ponce Health Science University's school of medicine, said mental health problems have increased after the hurricane and need to be dealt with swiftly.
""This is very important so as to minimize the impact and emotional effects,"" she said. ""It's not easy. We're reaching some people, but the island needs more mental health professionals. If we don't act, the situation can become problematic.""
""People are unable to go to work, they cannot produce, they do not know when they can return to work,"" she said. ""There's widespread despair.""

"At least 23 dead, hundreds missing, as winds fan California fires","SONOMA, Calif. (Reuters) - Firefighters struggled overnight to halt the spread of wildfires known to have killed 23 people in North California, preparing for winds to shift after one town threatened by flames evacuated all residents.
The edge of the deadly Tubbs fire was less than two miles (3km) from Calistoga, a Napa Valley community whose 5,000 residents left their homes on Wednesday.
Whether the town burns “is going to depend on the wind,” its Fire Chief Steve Campbell told Reuters early on Thursday. “High winds are predicted, but we have not received them yet.”
Tubbs is one of nearly two dozen fires spanning eight counties that, raging largely unchecked since igniting on Sunday, have left hundreds of residents unaccounted for.
They have also charred around 170,000 acres (69,000 hectares) of land and destroyed some 3,500 buildings since.
While their cause has not been conclusively determined, they are thought to have been sparked by power lines toppled by gale force winds, and fanned by hot, dry “Diablo” winds that blew into northern California toward the Pacific.
New advisory evacuations were also issued in Sonoma County late on Wednesday for parts of Santa Rosa, the largest city in the state’s world-renowned wine country, and Geyserville, an unincorporated town of 800 people.
“The winds are predicted to be very erratic,” said county spokesman Barry Dugan. “There will be burst of high gusts that can be ... very unpredictable and difficult when you are fighting a fire and also for residents who we are trying to keep posted.”
Wildfires have damaged or demolished at least 13 Napa Valley wineries, a vintners’ trade group said on Tuesday.

Around 25,000 people remained under evacuation on Wednesday as the fires belched smoke that drifted south over the San Francisco Bay area, where some residents donned face masks.
STILL MISSING
More than 285 people were still missing in Sonoma County late on Wednesday night, the sheriff said on Twitter. It was unclear how many might be fire victims rather than evacuees who had not checked in with authorities.

In Santa Rosa, blocks in some neighborhoods resembled war zones, with little left but charred debris, broken walls, chimneys and the steel frames of burned-out cars.
The 23 recorded deaths make the fires the deadliest in the state since 1991, with Tubbs, which has accounted for 13 fatalities, the worst single blaze since 2003, according to state data.
In addition to high winds, the fires have been stoked by an abundance of thick brush left tinder dry by a summer of hot, dry weather.
Matt Nauman, spokesman for the region’s main utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, said many power lines had fallen during gales that packed gusts in excess of 75 miles (120km) per hour.
California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in several northern counties, as well as in Orange County in Southern California, where a fire in Anaheim destroyed 15 structures and damaged 12.

This is the week when you have to start really making some choices. With the first four teams on scheduled byes, roster management will start coming into play. Carrying two defenses might be a luxury you can no longer afford, but that doesn’t mean we should stop streaming if it makes sense to do so. Let’s take a look at how the defenses rank for this week:
Minnesota Vikings – at Chicago Philadelphia Eagles – vs. Arizona Detroit Lions – vs. Carolina Pittsburgh Steelers – vs. Jacksonville Kansas City Chiefs – at Houston Buffalo Bills – at Cincinnati New York Jets – at Cleveland Jacksonville Jaguars – at Pittsburgh Baltimore Ravens – at Oakland San Francisco 49ers – at Indianapolis Oakland Raiders – at Baltimore Tennessee Titans – at Miami New York Giants – vs. LA Chargers Carolina Panthers – at Detroit Seattle Seahawks – at LA Rams
Notes:
Instead of targeting the Jets for your defense, it might be time to take a look at New York’s defense. A week after holding the Dolphins to a lone, last second touchdown, the Jets limited Jacksonville to 14 points last week. New York has two rookie safeties in Jamal Adams and Marcus Maye who have bolstered the secondary, and as a whole, they have looked sharper than they did the first two weeks of the season. Through four games the Jets haven’t generated much production, six sacks and four interceptions, but 20 points in the last two games is solid. It also doesn’t hurt that this week the Jets face the Browns who have allowed opposing defenses to rack up the second most points this season.
There is nothing better than taking advantage of a rookie quarterback making his first career start. It’s not like they generally take over in good situations, but it also helps that Chicago hasn’t had much success moving the ball. Conditions aren’t going to be ideal for Mitch Trubisky and, on paper, Minnesota has a strong defense. The results haven’t been there so far, but it’s really the lack of turnovers holding the Vikings back. They have given solid performances through four weeks, but they have three interceptions which all came against Jameis Winston. The Vikings will likely make things hard for the rookie as they have picked up 11 sacks so far this season.
Through the first four weeks of the season Detroit has the number one ranked fantasy defense. Other than last week against the Patriots, who haven’t shown much of a defense to speak of this season, Carolina has struggled to move the ball and generate points. Having Darius Slay to shut down the opposition’s number one receiver is a plus as the Lions have come up with seven interceptions and 10 sacks in four games while also scoring three touchdowns of their own. Despite his success last week, I have a hard time trusting Cam Newton and that means good things for Detroit.

Physician Group Slams McCain for Failure to Repeal Obamacare,"Physician Group Slams McCain for Failure to Repeal Obamacare
(Before It's News)
By Wire Service
TUCSON, Ariz., Sept. 25, 2017 –PRN– Arizona’s senior senator John McCain, who campaigned vigorously on a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or ObamaCare), is now a hero of the Democrats for his one-man blockade of the Republicans’ latest effort to make slight modifications in ACA, stated the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS).
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
“He is making the process the issue, rather than the bill itself,” observed executive director, Jane M. Orient, M.D. According to the Washington Post, “McCain blasted out a news release on Friday saying he’d consider supporting legislation had it undergone extensive hearings, debate and amendments—but noting that it hasn’t.”
“We have ObamaCare itself because it was rammed through without a single Republican vote, bypassing regular order,” Dr. Orient pointed out. “So if we want to use regular order to reform the system, we need to repeal ACA in its entirety, then immediately start a process for replacing or restoring any parts that have bipartisan support, through the regular order of hearings and debate,” she suggested.
“To avoid disrupting current arrangements, we could leave subsidies in place for one year—the legal ones, not the illegal ones now before the court,” she continued. “But repeal of the federal insurance mandates would allow the growth of affordable free-market replacements.”
“Democrats facing re-election could explain to their constituents why they supported the failing ObamaCare monster, or why they were not in favor of allowing Americans to choose their own medical financing arrangements,” she said.
“What we need is competition in the private sector to provide better medical care and affordable financing arrangements,” Dr. Orient stated. “What we are getting in Congress is States fighting over Medicaid money, and insurers fighting to keep their special preferences—for example, not allowing untaxed Health Savings Account (HSA) dollars to pay for care without insurers’ getting their cut.”
“How about a McCain-Paul repeal now/replace later bill?”

"A Cryptic Note, Impossible Planted Rifle And Swipe Of A Key Card That Doesn't Add Up","By Aaron Kesel
There are holes galore over the official narrative of the Las Vegas shooting; even police are starting to admit that a single gunman could not have been responsible for the plot. It’s way too sophisticated, far too many people died and were injured, while the motive hasn’t been determined thus far. Too much doesn’t add up. It seems like every day we are given more questions than answers as evidence begins to drip out. Now a cryptic note with numbers has been disclosed by authorities.
It has almost been a week since one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history but investigators, journalists, and armchair investigators are all left confused by what transpired in Las Vegas. There are so many theories, in fact, that YouTube has now tweaked its algorithm to protect you from questioning the official narrative, while regurgitating the mainstream media as an “authoritative source,” The Wall Street Journal reported.
“In response to criticism on social media of some search results this week, a person familiar with YouTube said the company is accelerating the rollout of planned changes to its search engine. On Wednesday night, the video service began promoting more authoritative sources in search results, especially pertaining to major news events, the person said. YouTube doesn’t disclose how it determines which sources are authoritative,” YouTube wrote in a statement.
The unthinkable, a shooting of a peaceful gathering for music interrupted by pelted gunfire which took the lives of 60 and injured hundreds of others. Perpetrated by the perfect criminal, a rich 64-year-old former accountant and real estate investor addicted to gambling who could afford 23 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition for all of those firearms.
The shooting reportedly lasted five to fifteen minutes, though estimates vary according to the Washington Post.
While that in itself raises questions such as if there are multiple guns why would authorities rule out a second, third or even possible fourth shooter before any formal investigation? Especially since earlier police audio indicated that there might be more than one shooter.
The story certainly doesn’t end there. Since the October 1st shooting new facts have emerged as the “official narrative” of the shooting takes shape that just leaves you scratching your head thinking wtf?
The gunman set up cameras throughout the hall, under the serving cart and in front of the door to watch for police, yet now MSM news outlets are reporting that he may have been planning to escape. If true, his car had homemade explosives in it; so was he planning on martyrdom?
Yesterday, the narrative took an even more blurry weird turn as investigators finally admitted that a note was found on the scene but the note was alleged to be just numbers, no letters, just cryptic code according to authorities.
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill confirmed the revelation in Friday’s press conference:
McMahill said Friday afternoon that police have yet to determine “what those numbers are or mean.”
“In the past, terror attacks or mass murder motive was made very clear by a note that was left, by a social media post, by a telephone call that was made, by investigators mining computer data,” Undersheriff McMahill said. “Today, in our investigation, we don’t have any of that uncovered. I wish we did. We will and are continuing to investigate with great tenacity and hope to arrive at an answer,” he added.
While a Las Vegas K9 police officer Dave Newton has alleged it was calculations about where the shooter needed to aim.
“I could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for for the crowd,” Newton said. “So he had had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there.”
This explains the police secrecy behind this note, at first denying that any “suicide note” even existed, but was subsequently revealed in leaked photos from the crime scene which forced police to acknowledge it. Also revealed in the leaked pictures were several anomalies of the crime scene. One example is the way the shooter died with a firearm perched over the killer’s leg and what looked like empty shells above his head in a pool of blood that had not a squirt somehow on the top of any of the bullets. In short, the scene was impossible, it was too perfect. Both the shell casing and gun looked planted. Maybe that is why the photos were leaked along with the existence of the note left on the table?
If someone shot themselves in the head and the bullet casing was there from firing hundreds of shots ejected from the gun, that scene would be impossible as there would be blood all over the shells, not just floating in a murky pool. In order for this scenario to happen the killer would have had to have been sitting down on the ground with a gun across his leg and when he blew his brains out there would be blood all behind him covering the empty shell casings in blood. Instead, what we see is a scene where the killer is bleeding out his skull drooling out blood while all of the visible bullets themselves remain virtually clean from any brain tissue residue.
It’s more likely that the crime scene was tampered with and someone left the rifle on his leg to prove it. Why? Because as the early reports stated by police, they “neutralized the killer.”
After the situation settled down, the narrative was changed to death by suicide. In this writer’s opinion, by covering up simple facts like cause of death the police are only fueling the theory that the attack was a false flag. While they further refused until now to tell the public about the existence of the note and stated there was no motive that only furthers that divide.
Other things that don’t quite add up, Stephen Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, is alleged to have worked at the hotel. Paddock used her key card to get around the place according to reports. Paddock’s car was held in a garage and security footage shows his vehicle leaving the facility, yet his key card was still used to get in the hotel when he was documented to have left the parking deck according to authorities. Then there is the recent discovery of a cell phone charger that didn’t match any of the cell phones used by the killer.
These are 2 major updates in regards to the #LasVegas shooter. https://t.co/pMAPPmpf0u pic.twitter.com/TmnyZOJMAG — Nick Short ?? (@PoliticalShort) October 6, 2017
There is also the unconfirmed alleged room service receipt which shows that Paddock paid for a meal for two, mere days before he decided to commit his mass massacre. If confirmed, since it’s been reported he was scouting out several other festivals including Lalapalooza and a hotel in Chicago, it may mean he had help for his now-known premeditated murder spree.
Another fact barely getting any media coverage is that Paddock filmed himself during the incident, something widely known to be done by jihadists who commit attacks in the allegiance of ISIS.
Former Trump campaign official James Brower expanded on the video stating:
“There is a video, this video will prove the motive. He had a secret digital profile that was uncovered in the last 24 hours,” Brower tweeted.
Brower then later tweeted “Motive will be pretty shocking, I won’t say much but it will definitely change a lot of things going forward.”

Motive will be pretty shocking, I won’t say much but it will definitely change a lot of things going forward. — James B Scooping ? (@jbro_1776) October 5, 2017
Brower revealed additional details to Infowars, “I’m being told the video basically speaks about a network, they wouldn’t tell me directly if it was ISIS but they threw little hints that it was,” he said. “The reason the video more than likely is never released is because they believe it will trigger the “cells” he speaks of.”
“There should be a statement on motive soon,” Brower added, “They believe he was inspired by ISIS.”
The FBI has denied that ISIS was responsible, stating they have found no evidence he was connected to the radical group.
ISIS claimed responsibility, stating Paddock converted to Islam 6 months ago but did not provide proof for their claims.
While police continue to echo earlier claims stating they are “confident … there was not another shooter in that room.” Albeit the facts above point to the potential that there was at least one other person involved in the tragedy.
However, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo has stated that you have to make the assumption he had some help at some point.
“Do you think this was all accomplished on his own?” Lombardo asked, noting the arsenal of weapons the shooter amassed, and the discovery of explosives in his car. He added: “You’ve got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point.”
Meanwhile, the DOJ has just released a press release which states an indictment for three men who planned a similar plot to shoot up concerts in New York over the summer in the name of ISIL but were caught.
Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, a 19-year-old citizen of Canada who pleaded guilty to terrorism charges, Talha Haroon, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen who lived in Pakistan and 37-year-old Russell Salic who is a citizen of the Philippines were all charged with terrorism-related charges.
The terror group released a propaganda video calling for attacks in May which specifically listed Las Vegas as an attack location, The Washington Times reported.
That video purportedly showed an American fighter calling for attacks in the U.S with images of the Las Vegas strip and Times Square as well as other potential Western targets, such as New York and Washington, according to NBC News.
The State Department issued a travel terror warning in mid-September of the threat ISIS poses to Americans mere weeks before the attack in Las Vegas.
“U.S. government facilities worldwide remain in a heightened state of alert. These facilities may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate,” the warning read. “Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa’ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack to more effectively target crowds, including the use of edged weapons, pistols, and vehicles as weapons.”
Of particular interest, the State Dept noted that extremists increasingly aim to assault “soft” targets, such as:
high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)
hotels, clubs, and restaurants
places of worship
schools
parks
shopping malls and markets
tourism infrastructure
public transportation systems
airports
There are way more questions left to be answered besides these, but these are the newest. For an early rundown on the shooting check out my article on Steemit here for a fair unbiased article exploring both sides of whether the shooting was a false flag or an ISIS attack. What we all know by now is this plot has too many elements to be the work of just one lone wolf who the media is now trying to push as mentally insane with health problems, but that would require dismissing the rest of the facts. None of this adds up.

SAN JUAN PILCAYA, Mexico (Reuters) - Rubble is all that remains of hundreds of houses rent asunder by the earthquake that struck Mexico in September, leaving owners lodging with relatives or friends, hoping their homes can be rebuilt or they can find new ones. reut.rs/2yUFmHr
At least 369 people died in the 7.1 magnitude quake that hit central Mexico, causing more devastation in the capital than any since the 1985 disaster that killed thousands.
Damage to housing was particularly striking in central areas of the country close to the epicenter of the quake southeast of Mexico City in the states of Puebla and Morelos.
Some houses were simply flattened by the shuddering tectonic shift which the government and the private sector estimated caused billions of dollars of damage.
“I lost everything. My aunt died here,” said Ana Maria Hernandez, 37, a clothing salesperson, as diggers cleared away the wreckage of her home in Jojutla de Juarez, Morelos.
Now living with relatives, she and many others hope their destroyed homes will eventually be rebuilt.

But uncertainty clouds the future for some.
Veronica Dircio, a 34-year-old housewife said “nothing was left” of the house she and her children called home before the earthquake hammered the town of San Juan Pilcaya in Puebla.

“We’re worried because they came and did a census of the homes; and whether it’s a big house or a small house, they haven’t told us if we’re at least going to be able to get back a bit of what was once our house,” Dircio said.
Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed in the quake, which followed another major tremor in the southwest of Mexico two weeks earlier that displaced thousands of people.
Maria Trinidad Gonzalez, 41, managed to salvage some cooking utensils and furniture from the ruins of her home in the small town of Tepalcingo in Morelos. Mounds of fallen bricks and churned up debris covered the floor of her roofless house.
With its walls pulled down and the contents strewn outdoors, the house of 70-year-old housewife Maria Guzman in San Jose Platanar in Puebla state was left completely uninhabitable by the quake, forcing her into a shelter.
“The most valuable thing that I recovered was the photo of my wedding day,” Guzman said outside the shattered building."
PA Attorney General Concerned About Equifax Cyberattack; Will U.S. Attorneys General Be Upset About Utility Smart Meters Hacking?,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
 
According to news reports [1], Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro is concerned about and investigating the credit bureau Equifax’s data breach affecting some 143 to 145 million Americans.
 
“People who believe they are an identity theft victim can contact the consumer protection bureau in Shapiro’s office.” [1]
 
“New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged New Yorkers to look out for potential hacking and phishing attempts by cybercriminals following the Equifax data breach.” [2]
 
CNBC News reports “Massachusetts says Equifax hack exposed more than half the state to risk of fraud” [3]. Listen carefully to what Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey says in the short video in this link about hacking personal information.
 
The real problem
 
Consumers don’t know Equifax was collecting their important credit information and selling it to others! However, that’s the very same tactic/problem/issue that is being programmed to be done by and with AMI Smart Meters being retrofitted on to electric, natural gas and water utilities services nationwide by states’ utility commissions. 
 
However, no safeguards are being mandated by state public utility commissions regarding the retrieval, collection, storage, safety and personal in-home data/information collection utility companies will be exploiting via the ZigBee transmitters and local microwave networks instituted to relay personal information back to “Big Brother Utility Company,” who, in turn, will sell and profit from customers’ information!
 
As Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey correctly points out, customers don’t opt in to the data collection.
 
 
 
 
 
That also is the most important point regarding the collection of personal data from inside customers’ homes via AMI Smart Meters—customers don’t know nor opt in, which can lead to even greater risks and problems besides identity theft.
 
What are the problems?
 
The problems can be cybercriminals stalking people and/or houses to learn when homes are not occupied; learning customers’ daily routines and habits in order to burglarize or vandalize; hacking to take down a certain customer’s meter and utility service, or even an entire neighborhood of meters; plus other innovative surveillance and hacking techniques hackers will think up and implement.
 
AMI Smart Meters can be the first line of ingress into taking down the power grid in any country!
 
Selling customer data to third parties for profit
 
Customer data surveillance and utilities selling to customer-unknown third parties by utility companies across the USA and in other countries is part and parcel of the Internet of Things and the surveillance society to be instituted under the UN’s Agenda 21 and 2030 one world governance goal.
 
Where’s the proof utilities will sell customers’ data?
 
The patented algorithm “Onzo” is a ‘business hacker’ invading customers’ privacy to collect in-home data and sell it to third parties for profit and marketing leads, and who knows what else.
 
Here’s a less than 2 minute video explaining Onzo’s purpose, methodology and invasion of your privacy.
 
 
https://youtu.be/YIkT5GmoIgQ?
 
About ONZO
 
ONZO is a global leader in consumer energy data and analytics. ONZO combines the science of energy analytics with disaggregation, lifestyle behavior analysis and probabilistic forecasting to give utilities and their customers unprecedented insights into how, where and when energy is used. Leveraging granular smart meter date, ONZO’s patented algorithms result in rich, highly accurate, customer-specific insights with actionable outcomes that help utilities improve customer engagement and energy efficiency, while reducing churn and creating new revenue opportunities.

Besides all of the above, costumers’ collected information will travel over highly porous microwave frequencies—similar to cell phone calls—and they can be hacked into by any high school kid with some knowledge of computers and a penchant for cyber thrills. What about the Russians?
 
Why should consumers be concerned?
 
First and foremost, probably nine out of ten utility customers don’t know they have had an AMI Smart Meter retrofitted on to their electric, natural gas and water utility services.
 
Secondly, customers are not aware that those new meters are sophisticated computers that will have to be replaced every 5 to 6 years and customers will be billed for them, as they are now, via monthly installments to their utility bills while utility companies obtained federal grants in the millions to roll out AMI Smart Meters!
 
Moreover, customers do not know their private lives are/will be monitored 24/7/365 to the point of knowing when you shower; use certain electrical devices no matter how personal; have that information sold to unknown third parties for unknown reasons and consequences; open your privacy and home to becoming a target for thieves, burglars and cybercriminals.
 
Safety or surveillance?
 
The New World Order governance agenda under the United Nations utilizing all the new “smart” technologies we’ve become addicted to, only leaves everyone more vulnerable to become a sitting duck for more and more criminal activity at the personal level. Do you want that?
 
Now is time during the Equifax fiasco about privacy and personal information being compromised to contact your respective state’s public utility commission and attorney general to bring the above information about AMI Smart Meter privacy issues to their attention and demand safety and security for your personal information, plus whatever else you don’t like or fear about AMI Smart Meter surveillance.
 
The analog meter, which operated without problems for decades while not spying on your house, is the safest meter to have. It’s not a fire hazard, as AMI Smart Meters are, because AMI SMs are made with plastic parts, have no surge protectors and emit non-thermal radiation waves that cause adverse health issues.

With AMI Smart Meters, customers can lose their privacy; become sitting ducks for criminals; and also lose their health due to electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) or what the medical profession calls idiopathic electromagnetic intolerance (IEI).
 
Welcome to the crazy world of smart technology!

What CST Thinks about Bengals-Browns today,"(Before It's News)
Cincinnati Bengals at Cleveland Browns
October 1, 2017
Bengals 29, Browns 17
I thought the Browns defense would lead the team to a few victories this year. I thought Myles Garrett and Jamie Collins would help that happen.
No pick today.
Browns 21, Bengals 17
This is the time of the Browns season when I start thinking about what else I could be doing on Sundays. After last week’s “Fool me once” pick, though, I play the fool once more in believing the Browns can scratch out a victory against the winless Bengals. An 0-4 start against this portion of the schedule would truly crank up the draft talk, “Fire Hue!” calls, and other Browns-related tedium that returns every year to Berea like the swallows to Capistrano. Meanwhile, I’ll turn my eyes to the two actual, factual championship-level teams we have in this town.
Bengals 38, Browns 6
The Juice is loose as of 12:01 this morning, Vegas time. Can he catch? Could he be any worse than our current WRs?
Bengals 31, Browns 24
The Browns shall not ruin my giddiness of getting D. Wade this week. He’s not the addition he would’ve been five years ago, but a move that’s being undersold by the pundits and local fans. Very ironic that C-Town is now home to two out of three most evil Big 3.
Browns 34, Bengals 7
I’m giving Brian a run for CST’s Biggest Homer.
Bengals 31, Browns 24
Don’t think the Browns have the talent to get it done today."
Scientist Calls “Check Mate” on Geoscience Misinformation Propaganda,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
Marvin Herndon, PhD, published another paper regarding global climate issues and ethics wherein he challenges the scientific community “to come clean” regarding their research, journals and ethics relative to weather science, which has garnered many titles: climate change, global warming, weather geoengineering, solar radiation management and who knows what it will become next in apparent attempts to confuse an awakening global population as to what’s been going on with geoengineered weather.
Source
Dr. Herndon’s paper “An Open Letter to Members of AGU, EGU, and IPCC Alleging Promotion of Fake Science at the Expense of Human and Environmental Health and Comments on AGU Draft Geoengineering Position Statement” was published in the New Concepts in Global Tectonics Journal, v. 5, no. 3, September 2017. www.ncgtjournal.com.
Dr. Herndon believes “Scientists are persons of integrity: They stand for what is right. They tell the truth and ensure that the full truth be known. They do not lie.” He’s definitely a holdover of “old time” scientists who don’t subscribe to what’s become known as “consensus science,” a pseudoscientific clan-like or religious-like approach to propagandizing special vested interests’ scientific agendas and ‘confirming’ study results for various reasons, e.g., financial gains; go along to get along; not be subjected to peer pressure; or not bear the brunt of being professionally ostracized!
Being an interdisciplinary scientist, Dr. Herndon earned degrees in physics and his PhD in nuclear chemistry. He’s no dummy! Additionally, he did post-doctoral work in geochemistry and cosmochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. As such, Herndon has continued his research into the current hot button climate change issue, since he alleges fake science is being promoted in science journals, which he contends needs to be challenged and corrected.
To illustrate Herndon’s point, he says this in his recently published paper:
Numerous AGU members along with members of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the European Geosciences Union (EGU) have been involved in failing to tell the full truth about climate change. These scientists promote the claim that greenhouse gases, most especially anthropogenic carbon dioxide, are responsible for global warming. They remain silent about the consequences of the daily, near-global aerosol geoengineering that has been taking place since at least the 1990s with growing scope and intensity [4]. Failure to discuss this massive global anthropogenic phenomenon not only negates the validity of these scientists’ assertions about climate change, but, I allege, makes those individuals, and their associated institutions, party to the biggest science scam ever perpetrated. And, as well, party to an activity many may consider to be a crime against humanity and the environment [5]. For 70 years the military interest in controlling the weather has been thoroughly documented [6]. Military experiments advanced from causing rain and snow to inhibiting rainfall by emplacing pollution particles into the atmosphere where clouds form. Eventually, the atmosphere becomes too moisture-laden and torrential rains and storms result. The net effect of the now near-daily, near-global ongoing covert geoengineering activity of emplacing pollution particles into the atmosphere is to contribute to global warming. While some sunlight is reflected back into space by aerosols, the deliberately spread pollution particles also heat the atmosphere and impede heat loss from Earth [4]. The albedo of snow and ice is lowered by certain particulates when they fall to Earth. There is, furthermore, evidence of a covert operation to deliberately melt ice by dispersing pseudo-cryoconite material [7]. [CJF emphasis]
However, in this writer’s opinion, this statement by Dr. Herndon is a KEY concern regarding the issue of consensus science not only in climate control but in every aspect and genre of ALL the sciences, specifically microwave technology, medicine, pharmaceuticals and vaccinology:
High-ranking and some other members of the AGU, EGU, and IPCC have been grossly remiss in ignoring the ongoing aerosol geoengineering. Not only are their climate-science results corrupted, but those scientists, who are unwilling to consider the evidence for ongoing climate engineering, demonstrate an absence of concern for human and environmental health. [CJF emphasis]
Dr. Herndon challenges
The draft Geoengineering Position Statement is a tainted document that not only fails to tell the truth but is produced by a panel composed of at least two individuals, Ken Caldeira and Marcia McNutt, who, I allege, have a documented track record of acting to deceive the scientific community and the public about the existence of and the adverse human and environmental health consequences of ongoing tropospheric particulate aerosol geoengineering. No one has the right to poison the air we all breathe, and no one has the right to hide the health risks from the public. The ongoing military aerosol geoengineering program has been conducted without public disclosure. [CJF emphasis]
Dr. Herndon’s insightful concerns reflect those of many conscientious scientists, millions of observant citizens and possibly even some politicians when he says,
Instead of being a body of scientists who are willing and able to provide independent scientific advice to the U. S. Congress, the National Academy of Sciences, I allege, has been corrupted and coopted to serve a political agenda that may be characterized as tyranny against human populations that involves crimes against humanity [5]. As the adverse health consequences of the current ongoing geoengineering become public, perhaps the legal community will instigate class action lawsuits. FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) No one has the right to poison the air we breathe and no one has the right to deceive the public of the adverse health risks involved in clandestine geoengineering. Not even the military has this right. [CJF emphasis]
When will consensus sciences finally be denigrated to the dustbin of Corporatism and legally be prosecuted under the RICO statute [the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] of the U.S. federal government?

BOSTON (Reuters) - A Brazilian whose arrest led U.S. authorities to discover $17 million hidden under a mattress is expected to plead guilty on Wednesday after being charged with trying to launder funds tied to one of the largest pyramid schemes ever.
Cleber Rene Rizerio Rocha, who prosecutors said tried to help get millions of dollars out of the United States that a co-founder of TelexFree Inc left behind when he fled the country, is scheduled to enter his plea in federal court in Boston.
Rocha, who faced conspiracy and money laundering charges, has been held without bail since his arrest in January. The 28-year-old’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
His case stemmed from an investigation of TelexFree, a Massachusetts-based company that sold voice-over-internet telephone service and that was founded by James Merrill, a U.S. citizen, and Carlos Wanzeler, a Brazilian.
Prosecutors said TelexFree was a pyramid scheme, making little to no money selling its service while taking in millions of dollars from thousands of people who paid to sign up to be “promoters” and post ads online for it.
It collapsed in 2014, inflicting more than $3 billion in losses on nearly 1.89 million people worldwide, prosecutors said.
Merrill was arrested in 2014. He was sentenced this March to six years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges.

Wanzeler, meanwhile, in 2014 fled to Brazil, where he cannot be extradited from, prosecutors said. They say in the process, he left behind tens of millions of dollars he laundered from TelexFree accounts.
In mid-2015, Leonardo Casula Francisco, his nephew, asked a cooperating witness to help transfer cash hidden in the greater Boston area out of the United States, an indictment said.
The pair agreed someone would be sent to the United States to deliver the money in increments to the witness, who would send it to accounts in Hong Kong where it would be transferred to Brazil, prosecutors said.
In December, Casula sent Rocha to the United States to deliver money to the witness, an indictment said.
Prosecutors said that following a Jan. 4 meeting in a parking lot where Rocha gave the witness $2.2 million in a suitcase, federal agents followed Rocha to a Westborough, Massachusetts, apartment complex.
After Rocha was arrested, he then helped agents locate the apartment, leading them to find $17 million hidden under a mattress, prosecutors said.

World Cup 2018: What are England boss Gareth Southgate's big challenges?,"Southgate has won six of his 11 matches as England manager, losing twice
Gareth Southgate successfully completed phase one of his task since succeeding Sam Allardyce as England manager by qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.
England secured their place in Russia with a 1-0 victory over Slovenia at Wembley on Thursday, but it was a struggling, spluttering performance that only underlined the scale of the task facing Southgate if he is to end an almost unbroken tale of under-achievement at recent major tournaments.
Fabio Capello's England were thrashed 4-1 by Germany in the last 16 at the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 and his successor, Roy Hodgson, could not get England out of the group stage in Brazil four years later.
Hodgson lost to Italy on penalties in the last eight of Euro 2012 before the embarrassment of a last-16 defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016 was the catalyst for his resignation.
There was little fanfare, celebration or sense of expectation around a discontented Wembley as England limped over the finishing line on Thursday - only evidence that Southgate has a huge job to get his squad in shape for next summer.
So what are the big issues facing 47-year-old Southgate, who was officially placed in charge in November 2016 after Allardyce's 67-day reign, as he plans to end England's cycle of failure?
Stick with Hart in goal?
Joe Hart was at fault for one of Iceland's goals at Euro 2016
Joe Hart has been unchallenged as England's first-choice tournament keeper since Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine, but the 30-year-old is now facing the twin obstacles of declining form and increased competition.
Hart made crucial errors and had technical flaws exposed when conceding long-range goals to Gareth Bale against Wales and Iceland's decisive goal from Kolbeinn Sigthorsson - both low and to his left from distance - at Euro 2016 and endured a mixed spell on loan at Torino when Pep Guardiola decided he was not his man at Manchester City.
Now at West Ham, Hart came under further scrutiny when conceding free-kicks to Leigh Griffiths in the 2-2 draw with Scotland at Hampden Park in June.
Southgate surprised many with his staunch faith in Hart, who made his international debut in June 2008, when retaining him for qualifiers in Malta and at home to Slovakia, although he made an important double save before Harry Kane's late winner against Slovenia at Wembley on Thursday.
However, the return to form and fitness of Stoke's Jack Butland - out for more than a year after injuring an ankle playing for England in Germany - means the goalkeeping debate will continue.
With Jordan Pickford, who is only 23, a rare shaft of light in Everton's desperate start to the season after his £30m move from Sunderland, the debate is likely to be pored over on a weekly basis as England keep faith with Hart but also have the best back-up options they have enjoyed for years.
Southgate may be taking a history lesson when it comes to England changing keepers after the failed introduction of Scott Carson for the key Euro 2008 qualifier at home to Croatia and Rob Green's blunder that gave the United States a draw in the opening game of the 2010 World Cup.
Southgate's goalkeeping options Since start of 2016-17 (league) Joe Hart Jack Butland Fraser Forster Tom Heaton* Jordan Pickford *Heaton is currently injured Games played 44 12 45 39 36 Goals conceded 75 19 55 52 62 Saves made 119 37 100 149 156 Clean sheets 9 3 17 10 5 Errors leading to goals 5 0 2 0 3 Save % 61% 65% 64% 74% 72%
Former England pair Phil Neville and Chris Waddle believe Southgate has made the correct decision in sticking with Hart.
Neville tells BBC Sport: ""Patience is the key and Gareth has got it absolutely right. If the first World Cup game was next week Joe Hart would be my number one.
""He'll want to protect his young goalkeepers. Pickford has got a lot on his plate to establish himself and have a full season at Everton. He's moved for a big price tag.
""Butland is only 24 and was out for a very long time with injury last year. It is a big season in terms of fitness. Can he play a full season? Has he got the durability?""
Waddle says: ""Joe is in the driving seat unless he makes a couple of big mistakes.
""There are certain positions in the team where you need settled partnerships. You need your goalkeeper to know his back four well and his centre-halves. It is a problem when you are throwing people in before or during a tournament.""
Former England defender Terry Butcher, who believes it is time for change, says: ""If you have got someone with Jack Butland's presence behind you it gives even more confidence, but with Joe there have been mistakes.
""Joe has done very well for England but his time has come to an end now.""
Southgate's instincts, for now at least, tell him to stick with Hart.
Can the centre of defence take the strain?
In the 12 matches since Euro 2016 England have started with six different centre-back combinations. The regular pairing has been Gary Cahill and John Stones (six matches). Cahill has started 11 out of 12 games.
England's changing central defensive partnerships have always survived in relative comfort in qualifiers only to be picked apart in the heat of tournament combat.
Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka were exposed by Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani in defeat by Uruguay in Brazil in 2014, while Chelsea's captain and Chris Smalling fared no better in France two years later.
Will it be any different in Russia?
Southgate still has shuffling to do in this position, but some pointers are emerging that might signpost the way to his partnership next summer.
Cahill and Manchester United's rejuvenated Phil Jones have started to establish a partnership. although a glance towards Manchester City may offer an even more attractive option.
John Stones disappeared almost unnoticed from England's team after being heralded as the future of their defence following a £47.5m move from Everton to Manchester City in summer 2016. He is now showing the sort of form that might tempt Southgate once more.
Neville says: ""If we are going into a major tournament in six or seven months' time and John Stones isn't our number one centre-back then he is not fulfilling his potential.
""In the World Cup, John Stones has got to be our number one centre-back. That is if he performs - he has to produce the qualities we know he has got and if he does he will start as number one centre-back probably alongside Phil Jones.""
Phil Neville's England starting XI at the 2018 World Cup
Waddle, however, has an interesting twist and potential for left-field experimentation. He says: ""Have we got the quality of defenders to cope with the top sides? At the minute it is a concern.
""I'd like to see Kyle Walker play a game in central defence. He's quick. He's strong. He's good in the air and he's got unbelievable energy.
""A lot of people say you'll miss him on the flank but you've still got people like Nathaniel Clyne when he hopefully gets fit again at Liverpool and Kieran Trippier at Spurs.
""It would be really interesting if you put Stones, Walker and another in there as an experiment.
""You could play Stones, Walker and Eric Dier. Decent on the ball, mobility, and you have Walker's raw pace as well.""
Chris Waddle's England starting XI at the 2018 World Cup
Will lack of midfield creativity dent England's chances?
England's central midfield combinations are workmanlike but lack players in the mould of Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes - the pass master who can make a difference.
It will prove a serious handicap in Russia if England struggle to serve the most potent part of their team, with Harry Kane up front and Dele Alli in behind.
It is not helped by a lack of contenders to play the role of finding the key to unlocking opposition defences.
""The biggest talking point in Southgate's team is in central midfield,"" says Neville.
""It is crying out for a creative player. Could it be Jordan Henderson, Eric Dier and Adam Lallana when he's fit? There is a space in midfield. There is a position on the right-hand side and in central midfield.""
Steven Gerrard was the last England player to score more than once at a World Cup with two goals in 2006
England's central midfield will be resolute in Russia, but where is the inspiration and creation?
""Sometimes you need someone with a variation of pass. England have players who can get it and give it,"" says Waddle.
""I don't think people like Jordan Henderson have played badly but sometimes you need someone who can get the ball off the back three or four and can just turn and see someone 40 or 50 yards away.
""The only two who come to mind at the minute who hit that sort of pass are Danny Drinkwater and Jonjo Shelvey. Henderson is very good at linking the play with simple football, as are Dier and Jake Livermore. Lallana is give-and-go, not a 30- or 40-yard passer.
""I know what people can say: Drinkwater might not get in Chelsea's team and Shelvey can let himself down but they can hit those passes.
""People like Shelvey and Drinkwater are maybe not everyone's cup of tea but you have to look at a system and balance. You shouldn't just pick the best English players at the top clubs.""
Shelvey has created the most chances of England's midfield contenders since the start of last season, although he was playing in the Championship for Newcastle in 2016-17.
Who are England's World Cup match-winners?
England have a striker close to world class in Harry Kane - and there are reasons for optimism if Southgate can find a way to serve a potentially deadly attack.
Dele Alli has proved his quality, if not his temperament, for Spurs and England, while Manchester United's Marcus Rashford looks increasingly like a certain starter in Russia.
Where are the goals coming from? Since Gary Lineker scored 10 goals in two World Cups (1986, 1990) no England player has scored more than twice at the tournament The current England squad has scored 60 goals between them. Harry Kane and Jermain Defoe are responsible for 31 of those
So are there reasons for England to be cheerful heading into the 2018 World Cup after the trauma of recent major tournaments?
The Kane-Alli axis will carry England's threat, according to Waddle. ""Kane just doesn't seem to miss. He is in the right position every time and you can't coach that,"" he says.
""You have to play Dele Alli with him. Now we have to look at how to get the best out of those players and build a team around them.
""Alli is a cert. He plays with Kane week in and week out. He makes a lot of his goals for him and they have a great partnership.""
England's World Cup wins 2014: None 2010: Slovenia (1-0) 2006: Paraguay (1-0), Trinidad & Tobago (2-0), Ecuador (1-0) 2002: Argentina (1-0), Denmark (3-0) 1998: Tunisia (2-0), Colombia (2-0)
Phil Neville looks towards his former home of Old Trafford for the forward Southgate should integrate alongside Kane and Alli.
""Fast forward seven months and you have got to be saying Rashford should be in there"", says Neville.
""If Gareth can find a system for both Rashford and Kane then that would be as exciting a partnership as most teams could offer going forward.
""Kane is at that level now where he is becoming a world-class centre-forward and Rashford has got the potential to be there if he keeps developing.
""Rashford is going to be a superstar - I've said it a million times; I really believe that. You can see him, Kane and Dele Alli producing.""
If Southgate can use England's forthcoming friendlies to forge a link between that trio, he and his squad can carry serious danger in Russia next summer.
Should Kane be England's World Cup captain?
Outsiders - even then England manager Fabio Capello - never understand the nation's obsession with who leads the team out.
However, it still matters and it seems Southgate has narrowed it down to a choice between Kane and Henderson, who have both had auditions during the World Cup qualifiers.
Harry Kane has scored 11 goals for England, including six in his past five appearances
Kane captained the team against Slovakia. He has the advantage of being a certain starter, a goalscoring inspiration and a role model on and off the field, while Henderson may need to fight for his place.
Neville is certain who it should not be. He says: ""I've never been a fan of centre-forwards being captain - they are under enough pressure to score goals as it is. I would just say to Harry Kane, 'You just concentrate on scoring goals.'
""I'd give it someone like Jordan Henderson, or Eric Dier could be a real outside chance if he cements his place in the team.""
Butcher has a different view. ""There is only one person for me and that is the person who is going to play on a regular basis and that is Harry Kane,"" he says. ""He is the poster boy but he is also producing the goods.
""He is one of the first, if not the first, name on the team sheet. You couldn't say that about Jordan Henderson.
""You can't argue with Kane's record or the way he goes about his work. He is a lethal striker but an absolute gentleman off the pitch."""

Harvey Weinstein Draws Sharp Attacks From Late-Night Hosts,"Photo
Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com.
Weighing In on Weinstein
Late-night hosts on Monday stepped up to address the firing of the famed Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who is accused of sexually harassing a number of women.
Over the weekend Jimmy Kimmel got into a Twitter quarrel with Donald Trump Jr. over whether he would attack Mr. Weinstein on Monday’s show.
“People are pointing to the fact that Harvey Weinstein was a Clinton supporter, and listen, it’s true. I’m not defending Hillary Clinton. The fact is, her campaign did take money from what turned out to be a high-profile man who’s been accused of sexual harassment multiple times. And not just one of them, by the way — she took money from two of them: Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump, who donated to Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2008.” — JIMMY KIMMEL
“What’s the difference between Harvey Weinstein and the Pillsbury Doughboy? When the Pillsbury Doughboy offers you a roll, he doesn’t ask you to watch him take a shower for it.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “Harvey Weinstein was fired by his company yesterday for being accused of sexual harassment. Not good. They said if he keeps it up he’ll wind up with his own show on Fox News.” — JIMMY FALLON “This is monstrous behavior that in a just world would not have been allowed to go on for decades. It is indefensible. Weinstein immediately defended it — saying, ‘I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.’ And Weinstein’s lawyers called him ‘an old dinosaur learning new ways.’ O.K.: A) that’s no excuse; B) dinosaurs did not touch themselves in front of the employees. The T-rex’s arms were way too short.” — STEPHEN COLBERT
Stephen Colbert gave a pithy take.
“Famed Hollywood producer and human Shrek Harvey Weinstein is a bad person.” — STEPHEN COLBERT
On the Origins of ‘Fake’
And many hosts responded to Mr. Trump’s claim in an interview with Mike Huckabee that he invented the word “fake.”
“Sorry, what? You never noticed anyone use the word ‘fake’ before? You never heard anyone describe your hair, tan, university, foundation, net worth, marriages or business?” — SETH MEYERS “‘Fake’? What better way to celebrate Columbus Day than pretending you discovered something?” — JIMMY FALLON “You think you came up with the word ‘fake’? Sir, just because you’ve never noticed something doesn’t mean it wasn’t there all along. Look at Eric.” — STEPHEN COLBERT
The Feud Between Corker and Trump
A minor war of words between Mr. Trump and Senator Bob Corker gave Seth Meyers and James Corden plenty of material to work with, too.
“Senator Bob Corker is continuing to escalate his feud with President Trump, telling The New York Times that Trump is on the path to World War III. Said Trump: ‘I have bone spurs, I can’t go to World War III!’” — SETH MEYERS
“Corker’s tweet is funny. It’s not entirely accurate. A day care center would imply that someone there is actually in charge.” — JAMES CORDEN
The Punchiest Punchlines (Fallon Edition)
“A new study finds that playing outside may help kids’ eyesight. Kids were like, ‘Cool,’ and then just took their iPads outside.” — JIMMY FALLON
“Vice President Mike Pence left the Colts game yesterday after some of the 49ers kneeled during the national anthem. Also because he heard the phrase ‘man on man’ and got really uncomfortable.” — JIMMY FALLON
The Bits Worth Watching
Jon Stewart visited “The Late Show” for a skit imagining what it’d be like if late-night hosts gave “equal time” to pro-Trump material. It wasn’t easy for him.
The women of “Late Night” spoke to Mr. Meyers about the Weinstein news.

One of Liberia's main parties calls for halt to election results,"MONROVIA (Reuters) - One of Liberia’s leading political parties called for a halt in announcing the result of Tuesday’s presidential election, citing irregularities in the vote.
The Liberty Party, whose candidate Charles Brumskine was considered a front-runner to take over from Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said it would consider taking legal action if the National Elections Commission (NEC) did not act on its demands.
The NEC was originally expected to release preliminary results on Thursday.
“The Liberty Party is deeply troubled by the discovery of numerous incidents of irregularities and fraud that occurred during the elections,” Liberty Party national chairman Benjamin Sanvee said in a statement.
“We are calling on NEC to immediately halt further announcements of election results. If NEC does not cooperate with our request, we will take the appropriate legal action,” he said.

He did not give specific evidence of voter fraud and it was unclear what kind of activity could have altered Tuesday’s vote.
An NEC spokesman told Reuters that it was unaware of the Liberty Party’s complaint and did not say whether the commission believed illegal acts occurred.

On election day, materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls, witnesses said, but there was so far no evidence that this was linked to illicit activity.
Any irregularities would taint the results of an election expected to mark the first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades in a country haunted by a civil war that ended nearly 15 years ago.
Liberia, Africa’s oldest modern republic, was founded by freed U.S. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer dates back to 1943.
Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first elected female president, won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post-war transition. She was re-elected in 2011 but is barred from seeking another term."
"Vegas Shooter Filmed Himself During Slaughter, May Have Left A Note; Suicide Photo Emerges","Warning: Graphic Content Below
 
Millionaire Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock set up a camera inside his hotel room to capture his deadly shooting rampage on film, as well as various other surveillance equipment in the hallway to alert him as cops closed in on him. According to ABC, the shooter had at least one lens set up to tape himself as he fired hundreds of rounds on thousands of unsuspecting concertgoers several hundred yards below his Mandalay Bay casino suite. Also, knowing that the cops would eventually catch up to him, he also reportedly wired cameras in the hallway outside his room so he could see when the heat was getting close.
 
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joseph Lombardo confirmed that Paddock had cameras inside and outside of his hotel room during a late-afternoon press conference.
 
According to his brother, Paddock, 64, had made millions from real estate deals; he also owned two planes and several properties across the US, and seemed normal apart from his passion for gambling large sums. He’d also secretly amassed a massive arsenal of no less than 42 firearms with at least one of those an automatic, while another two had been modified with legal bump-stock devices that allows semi-automatic guns to give full-auto fire of up to 800 rounds a minute. Several had scopes, and packed military-grade ammunition.
 
Paddock took 23 of those guns into his Mandalay Bay suite over several days and set up two rifles on tripods at windows overlooking the Route 91 Harvest country music festival. According to the Daily Mail, Thousands of rounds of ammunition were also found in the suite, enabling him to fire repeatedly over the course of 72 minutes. His car had several pounds of a fertilizer used in bomb-making.
 
A look outside his room via ABC:
 
 
And inside:
 
 
And, as we now learn, he also reportedly set up a camera in his room, apparently to film the mass murder, and others in the hallway to capture police arriving. Before carrying out the shooting, he used a hammer-like tool to smash out two window in his room which he used to fire out of.
 
 
Paddock had lived in 27 residences in Nevada, Florida and Texas as an adult, but other than that he had apparently lived a quiet and unremarkable life – and the reason for the most deadly assault in American history is still a mystery. Explanations have been offered for his motive, but law enforcement has
 remained coy. It has been suggested debts, a relationship collapse, or
 his family history may have contributed to the his drive to kill.
 
The retired accountant had worked as an internal auditor at Lockheed Martin for three years in the late 1980s, and was a manager and investor in apartment complexes located in Mesquite, Texas and California, which made him millions, his brother said, according to the Las Vegas Sun. A federal spokeswoman he worked as letter carrier, IRS agent for nearly a decade in 1970s and ’80s
 
Local police said they had no run-ins with the man, not even traffic violations, and his brother described him as ‘just a guy who lived in Mesquite who drove down and gambled in Las Vegas and… liked burritos’. So the discovery that he had used 10 suitcases to methodically move an arsenal up into his Mandalay Bay room over the preceding weekend came as a shock to those who knew him.
 
Eric Paddock said he thought his brother was far from a gun fanatic. ‘He had a couple of guns but they were all handgun, legal… he might have had one long gun, but he had them in a safe,’ he said. He said he didn’t know about the 23 guns that were found in the hotel room.
 
 
Speaking to the WSJ, a law enforcement source said that they found at least one fully automatic rifle among the batch, which included AR-15-style rifles and AK-47-style rifles. As we reported this morning, it also later emerged that two other semi-auto guns had been legally modified with bump-stocks that allow them to function like fully automatic rifles, pumping out 400-800 bullets a minute.
 
Among the weapons found in the room were four Daniel Defense DDM4 rifles, three FN-15s and other rifles made by Sig Sauer. A handgun was also found.
 
 
Four DDM4 rifles were among the 23 weapons found in Paddock’s hotel room.
 
 
Three FN-15 rifles, as well as guns made by Sig Sauer, were found in his arsenal.
 
 A Colt AR-15 was also found in the room
 
 Stephen Paddock’s room was packed with 23 guns and lots of ammo
 
Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said on Monday it wasn’t clear whether the full-auto gun was modified, or if it was originally made that way. He also said that the ammunition ranged in size from .308, usually used in hunting rifles, to .223, associated with AR-15s and other assault rifles – the latter being military-grade, the New York Daily News reported.
 
Eric said the revelation of his brother’s deadly plan, which saw thousands of rounds falling on a crowd of 22,000 people at a music festival below, was as unexpected as seeing a meteor suddenly landing on his street.
 
The shocks only grew in number Monday as police raided two of Paddock’s properties. The first was his Mesquite home in a sleepy retirement community, which he purchased for just over $369,000 in 2015 according to public records.
 
 He lived at the $400,000 property (pictured with crumpled garage door after police raid) with Danley
 
Some 19 additional firearms were in the house, along with the explosive Tannerite – which is used to make explosive targets for target practice – and several thousand rounds of ammunition, Lombardo said Monday. He added that electronic devices were also found, but that they are still being examined to determine their purpose. Photos of the property showed the garage door torn off its hinge and crumpled after the search.
 
Police also found the fertilizer ammonium nitrate – which can be used to make bombs – in Paddock’s car in Las Vegas on Monday.
 
A SWAT team also raided a second property owned by Paddock in Reno on Monday. Bomb experts were on hand, due to concerns over booby traps. Police have not yet revealed what, if anything, they found there. Speaking on Monday evening, police said that the scene was still being examined by detectives.
 
Although ISIS have repeatedly attempted to claim credit for the shooting, saying Paddock had recently converted to Islam, both his brother and authorities have dismissed the claims. He had ‘no religious affiliation, no political affiliation,’ Eric said, adding: ‘He just hung out.’
 
He also had no Army training, nor expressed any particular interest in guns, Eric added – though he admitted that, as he lives in Florida, he had not spoken much with his brother over the last year. ‘His life is an open book. It’s all in public record,’ he said. ‘Once again, there is nothing. He went to college. He had a job.’
 
Paddock had both hunting and fishing licenses according to public records, as well as his pilot’s license, but no criminal record in the state of Nevada. Only his gambling habit stood out as unusual; Stephen would play $100 hands of video poker, and ‘once texted me a picture that he won $40,000 on a slot machine,’ Eric said. Neighbors at one of his properties in Florida said that they had barely talked to him – that he gave them keys to check on the property, and would only turn up every three months or so. When he did, they said, he would rarely be seen because he stayed up late at night playing poker online.
 
Law enforcement officials said that in recent weeks he had made a number of transactions in Las Vegas that were in the tens of thousands of dollars. On some days he spent more than $30,000, and on others more than $20,000, according to an individual who had seen Paddock’s Multiple Currency Transaction Reports. It’s not known whether he made money back on any recent bets, or lost it.
 
In his private life, Paddock enjoyed country shows on the Las Vegas Strip – such as the one he eventually attacked. Paddock’s time in Las Vegas wasn’t totally without event, however; in 2012 he filed a lawsuit against Cosmopolitan Hotels & Resorts following an incident that occurred at their Las Vegas casino. Paddock spent two years in court fighting his case after submitting his initial complaint citing ‘Negligence – Premises Liability.’
 
It was ultimately dismissed with prejudice in late 2014, and exact details of the case were not available on the Clark County Courts website.
 
Paddock was also the son of Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, a serial bank robber who ended up on the FBI Most Wanted list back in 1969 when he escaped from federal prison in Texas while serving a 20 years sentence. The FBI kept him on the list for the next eight years, and he was eventually found one year after he was removed from the list in 1978 while outside an Oregon Bingo hall. The agency said that the fugitive had been ‘diagnosed as psychopathic’ and also had possible ‘suicidal tendencies.’
 
The attack ended when the police breached the door to his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort just after 10pm on Sunday night, by which time Paddock had committed suicide. The result is shown in the photo below.
 
 
Finally, as the Star reports, the shooter may have left a suicide message: a note left by the gunman may offer clues to his reasons for slaughtering country music fans at the Route 91 Harvest Festival. The police have repeatedly said investigations are ongoing and have yet to make public any details.

Weinstein Co board ousts Harvey Weinstein after harassment allegations,"(Reuters) - The Weinstein Co has fired co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein, effective immediately, following reports of sexual harassment allegations against the executive, who was one of Hollywood’s biggest power brokers, the film production company said on Sunday.
The departure leaves Weinstein’s brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser at the helm of the company.
The board of directors made the decision “in light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding that he had been notified.
A spokeswoman for the executive did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company said on Friday that Weinstein, 65, was taking an indefinite leave of absence after the New York Times reported that he had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.
Weinstein has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign.
The company also said it was conducting its own internal investigation.

Trump vs. Corker encapsulates GOP civil war,"It goes a long way to explain the tussle raging within the GOP itself -- over the party's approach to validating its Washington majority, its responsibility for global stewardship and its prospects in the 2018 midterm elections.
Trump reignited the clash Tuesday, saying on Twitter that ""Liddle' Bob Corker"" had been made to ""sound a fool"" in an interview recorded by The New York Times.
""That's what I am dealing with,"" he wrote.
As the President and foreign relations committee chairman wage their war of words, they are highlighting, and testing, lessons of last year's riotous election forged in the heat of a party civil war that has only grown more intense.
The first is that there are now effectively two Republican parties -- one dominated by Trump and his uber-loyal followers, for whom his feud with Corker represents exactly the kind of disruption they hoped to see him unleash. The other GOP, meanwhile, is made up of establishment, orthodox conservatives like the Tennessee senator and his Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who want to use their power to legislate and fret about Trump's global leadership.
The second rule of last year's Republican primary circus is one that Corker is now daring to confound -- namely that no one who gets down in the muck with a brutal political street-fighter like Trump comes out clean or unscathed. Trump's showdown with Corker, which went nuclear over the weekend, will go a long way to deciding the state of the GOP as it musters for midterm elections next year -- at which its monopoly in Washington will be on the line.
It could also show whether Trump's go-to tactic of waging war on the Republican Party establishment, that has proven so profitable in the past, is a viable strategy going forward or whether it is ultimately self-defeating. Trump briefly toed the party line in backing Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in his losing primary race against Roy Moore last month -- but even before voters went to the polls, he admitted he might have done the wrong thing.
Familiar script
In many ways, the Corker vs. Trump prizefight is familiar: it's a reprise of the classic showdown between the populist, nationalist President and a GOP grandee devoted to conservative rule at home and internationalism abroad.
""There is a lot going on in the Republican Party,"" Andre Bauer, a former lieutenant governor of South Carolina, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Monday. ""You have an establishment class senator in Bob Corker that has always held himself above the fray, conducted himself (as) most Republicans think a Republican senator should act like.""
""But Donald Trump challenged the Republican establishment -- there are a lot of Republicans like me that quite frankly were sick of the same old, same old ... he has continued to fight the system,"" Bauer added.
There have been signs that if Trump fails to secure results on Capitol Hill, he could effectively become the first sitting Republican president to run against a do-nothing Congress of his own party in the midterms, perhaps by backing insurgent GOPers in primary races against establishment lawmakers.
And from the party's grassroots, Corker's intervention may seem less consequential than it did in Washington, which was transfixed by the spat that culminated when the senator warned Trump's volatile temperament could put the US on the path to ""World War III.""
Some Washington pundits and media commentators praised Corker for having the courage to finally stand up to Trump, for voicing what many GOP figures say privately and for no longer appeasing what they see as the President's dangerous approach to crises like the standoff with North Korea.

The base reacts
But outside Washington, things often appear differently.
Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh , for instance, told his listeners on Monday that Corker was part of a cabal of Washington Republicans who wanted to ""nullify"" Trump and preserve the ""current world order."" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Trump was channeling frustration against the Washington GOP's struggles to implement his agenda.
""'We sent you there, we gave you the White House, the Senate, we want to see these things get done,'"" she said, voicing complaints she had heard at town hall meetings.
CNN's White House team reported Monday that Trump was not yet done with the controversy. Sources said the President believed that other senators may be loath to criticize him, since unlike Corker, who has announced he will retire after the midterm elections, they may fear the wrath of his loyalists in primaries.
Texas Republican consultant Bill Miller described the reaction to Trump's latest antics in the Lone Star State as ""eye-rolling"" compared to the ""head-exploding"" reactions taking place in Washington. But he also challenged the perception that the President's behavior would always be accepted by grassroots Republican voters.
""This is what he does, it is a trick to do this. It works less effectively every successive time. What I believe is happening even down here in Texas, which is very conservative, is that there is a sense of a behavioral issue ... it is impolitic,"" Miller said. ""It's just not smart. It's counterproductive, it isn't producing any kind of result you want. If your goal is to blow things up, destroy, great, but that is not a good first-term record.""

Trump vs. the establishment, again
Trump has a history of taking on GOP establishment figures and crushing them, starting with the presidential primary race. When elite opponents like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio tried to slug out a bare-knuckle fight with him, they limped away with their political reputations wounded.
But in Washington, the President's record for knockouts has been less effective. Trump's unpredictable ways and tendency to turn upon Republicans has contributed to his struggle to secure a major legislative win. His efforts to help repeal Obamacare, for instance, often seemed ill-informed or counterproductive.
And when Republican Sen. John McCain stood up to Trump's power and helped derail a last ditch bid to repeal Obamacare , he polished his own legacy -- at least in Washington -- and won sympathy when the President attacked him shortly after his brain cancer diagnosis.
On Monday, many Beltway strategists and senior Republicans were left shaking their heads, warning that Trump's reflexive lashing out could cost him the crucial vote of Corker as he seeks a year-end legislative victory.
""Going after a senator whose vote you need on tax reform is not the best strategy,"" Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy said on CNN
But there were also signs on Monday that Washington's GOP divides may be bridgeable, as another Republican, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has often clashed with the President, took to the links alongside him.
Unusually, the White House allowed cameras to record Trump on the golf course, sending a message that Corker's revolt was not uniform among GOP senators. Less than two months ago, Graham was castigating the President over his sluggish condemnation of white supremacists after racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, warning ""history is watching us all.""
On Monday, after a round at Trump's club in Virginia, Graham praised him for a performance worthy of a golf pro, shrewdly identifying the way to his host's heart.
""President Trump shot a 73 in windy and wet conditions!"" Graham tweeted."
Australia 2-1 Syria AET,"Media playback is not supported on this device Syria's 2018 World Cup dream ended by Australia
Syria's unlikely 2018 World Cup dream is over after Tim Cahill's extra-time header saw Australia progress 3-2 on aggregate to the final qualifying tie.
Omar Al Somah gave the civil war-torn nation hope of reaching Russia when he gave them an early lead in Sydney.
But Cahill, 37, quickly equalised with the first of his two headed goals.
Syria, who drew 1-1 in the first leg, were reduced to 10 men when Mahmoud Al Mawas was sent off before Cahill nodded in Robbie Kruse's cross for the winner.
Australia will now play Honduras from the Concacaf section for a place in the finals.
Cahill's 50th goal for his country sealed Australia's progress to the final round of World Cup qualifying
Syria were given real hope of reaching their first World Cup finals when a loose Mark Milligan pass let Al Somah charge through to score a sixth-minute opener with a low left-footed shot.
But Hertha Berlin winger Mathew Leckie engineered parity for the hosts when he provided the perfect cross for former Everton midfielder Cahill's first on 13 minutes.
The introduction of Huddersfield Town midfielder Aaron Mooy from the bench was then pivotal.
Australia manager Ange Postecoglou surprisingly left the 27-year-old out of his starting line-up, but the home side were instantly improved by his presence.
Indeed it was only Syria goalkeeper Ibrahim Almeh's heroics that denied Celtic's Tom Rogic and Leckie from sealing Australia's progress in the second half.
Syria defended resolutely and admirably got to extra time, but their task became harder when Al Mawas saw red for a second booking for bringing down Kruse.
With penalties looming, Cahill produced a trademark last-gasp header to score his 50th goal for Australia - more than any other player for the country.
Yet despite being a man down, the visitors almost snatched an equaliser to take the tie to penalties when Al Somah's free-kick hit the post in the 121st minute.
Omar Al Somah also scored Syria's goal in the first-leg draw in Malaysia
'Our disappointment is very big'
Syria coach Ayman al-Hakim: ""The first goal was a small mistake, not a major mistake, and the second goal was because we had 10 players.
""We studied the Socceroos very well and I think if we had stayed at 11 players and hadn't had that red card and hit the [post] at the end [it would have been different].
""But I am very proud of my boys with what they have achieved so far, and that's going to be continuing moving forward as well.""
Forward Firas Al Khatib: ""We were hoping to provide a smile and joy to Syrians everywhere. Our disappointment is very big.""
'We keep working until we can't anymore'
Tim Cahill became the 59th player in history to score 50 international goals
Socceroos midfielder Mark Milligan: ""Timmy [Cahill] worked outstandingly. That is something we have in us. We work until we cannot anymore.
""It was a loose pass [before Syria's goal]. I could have hit it a bit harder but they punished us with the quality in their striker.
""The longer the game went on, we had a good stranglehold on it. They fought with everything, they were outstanding and gave us an extremely tough match on our home soil.
""The next round will be a different match, we will have a different challenge on our hands.""
Analysis: That they were in contention was remarkable
Syria fans made their presence felt in the ANZ Stadium in Sydney
BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway:
""We went over to Syria for BBC Sport earlier in the year and spent six days in Damascus and discovered a truly remarkable story.
""Syria is in the middle of a six-year war and the team have no money because of the sanctions. Lots of Syrians have mixed emotions about supporting the team. Some, but by no means all, feel that the team rises above politics.
""The fact they were in contention for the World Cup was remarkable given what is stacked against them. They have a remarkable team spirit.
""They played their home games in Malaysia, which is a 14,000-mile round trip, and where they played the home leg of their play-off match against Australia.""
Fans turn out in Syrian cities
There were huge crowds in Syria's cities to follow the national team's fortunes
Syrian state TV broadcasting was dominated by coverage of the country's match against Australia.
It aired special programming, with live footage of huge crowds in Damascus's Umayyad Square, Aleppo, Homs and Sweida.
Shadi Helweh, usually the channel's war correspondent and who famously covered the landmark recapture of the city by government forces in December last year, was drafted in to report on the huge crowds in Aleppo."
South Africa's Durban Port remains closed after severe storm,"A container ship blocks the harbour mouth in Durban, South Africa, October 10, 2017 in this still image obtained from a social media video. BLUE SECURITY via REUTERS
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s largest port remains closed on Wednesday after vessel movements were suspended when a severe storm lashed the coastal region resulting in at least eight deaths in the province, a port official said.
The Durban Port manager Moshe Motlohi told Reuters it was still too early to assess the extent or costs of damages to sub-Saharan Africa’s largest port, which is a key transit point for commodities such as maize.
“It’s going to take a few days to access how much was involved in terms of cost,” said Motlohi.
Three vessels were grounded, containers had blown into the bay and mooring lines were broken in the channel in the Port of Durban on Monday, the Transnet National Ports Authority said in a statement.
The KwaZulu-Natal provincial officials confirmed on Wednesday that at least eight people had died as a result of the storm with further reports of missing people.
Motlohi could not estimate when the port would be opened again but said it is unlikely it will open on Wednesday."
Glencore pips Sinopec to buy Chevron's South African assets,"The logo of commodities trader Glencore is pictured in front of the company's headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, July 18, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann
LONDON (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China’s Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron’s South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors.
The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.
In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron’s 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.
An industry source familiar with Glencore’s mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.
A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.
In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China’s largest refiner Sinopec, for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa’s Economic Development ministry.
Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor.
END OF ERA
The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.
Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.
Chevron, which has had a presence in South Africa for more than a century, announced the sale in January 2016.
Nimbler oil trading firms have snapped up the unwanted oil refineries and retail stations particularly in industrializing nations such as South Africa where young populations and a fast-growing middle class are expected to boost fuel demand.
Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices.
The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron’s local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018.
“Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months,” it said.
If the deal closes, this would be Glencore’s first refining asset. It began expanding into downstream oil in May after setting up a retail franchise in Mexico.

Mexico warns US about ending Nafta trade deal,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Nafta has led to a huge increase in trade between the US, Mexico and Canada
Ending the North American Trade Agreement (Nafta) would break relations between Mexico and the US, the Mexican foreign minister has warned.
Luis Videgaray was speaking ahead of a new round of trade talks this week between the US, Mexico and Canada.
The talks to update the 1994 deal have become increasingly acrimonious, with Mexico and American business groups saying US proposals would hurt trade.
This week, President Donald Trump repeated threats to scrap the deal.
He has pointed to the trade deficit with Mexico as unfair to the US. His administration has said it was seeking to reduce it and called for a major overhaul of the agreement.
The head of the US Chamber of Commerce, Thomas Donahue, warned that scrapping the deal would endanger $1tr in annual trade.
Mr Videgaray said Mexico was preparing for ""different scenarios"" the talks might produce and would not remain within the agreement if it was not good for his country.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Luis Videgaray says his priority is to defend Mexico's interests
He warned that ending the regional trade pact would hurt relations between the US and Mexico and damage their co-operation on other issues such as fighting drug-trafficking and stopping illegal immigration across the US's southern border.
What's at stake with the Nafta talks?
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is meeting Mr Trump on Wednesday and their discussions are expected to focus on Nafta. The US has recently slapped duties on Canadian Bombardier airliners and wood exports.
Mr Trudeau then flies to Mexico for discussions with President Enrique Peña Nieto."
"Rohingya Genocide - Links to Corporatism, Geopolitics & Wahhabism","By Chris Kanthan
The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar is harrowing, with more than 150,000 Muslims having to flee the country in the recent months. The stories of persecution and ethnic cleansing are very troubling, although sporadic conflicts between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar have existed for many decades. While the mainstream media is focusing exclusively on the religious context of this story, they are completely missing – or deliberately avoiding – the potential roles of oil/gas pipelines, geopolitical US-China tug of war, and Saudi Arabia’s subversive influence in that region.
Let’s start with the obvious – the Western media is not going to shed crocodile tears for some people in a far away place such as Myanmar, unless there is some hidden agenda related to billions of dollars and the Deep State.
Now some basic facts about Myanmar:
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is quite a big country (it’s more than twice as large as Vietnam). Although a poor country that hasn’t been in the radar of globalists for many decades, it has become a very strategic piece of land in China’s new Silk Road (a.k.a One Belt, One Road). Of course, any country that’s important to China becomes an object of exceptional interest to the elites in Washington D.C. Myanmar was under military rule for many decades, and then slowly started opening up its economy in the 1990s. The reforms accelerated in 2006, after which foreign investments skyrocketed. Dubbing Myanmar the “last Asian frontier,” mining corporations and oil/gas companies from all over the world rushed into Myanmar and discovered plenty of untapped natural resources. Myanmar’s GDP quadrupled in the last ten years, thanks to revenues from natural gas, tin, forestry, rubber, gold, precious metals (jade) and more. Unfortunately, all these operations also result in ruthless exploitation of laborers, destruction of environment, and mass eviction of people from their lands. Rohingya Muslims are primarily concentrated in a state on the west coast in Myanmar. It’s not a coincidence that the state is adjacent to Bangladesh, an Islamic country. Rohingya people are basically Muslims who came to Myanmar from Bangladesh (roughly speaking, since there’s a lot of history here, especially regarding British colonies in the 19th century).
Corporatism
Now, let’s take a look at the map of some of the Myanmar oil fields (see below). What’s the red area? That’s the region where the Rohingya Muslims live. See how they are surrounded by offshore (light blue) and onshore oil/gas fields?
One of Myanmar’s largest offshore gas production is the Shwe Project, which is smack in that coastal area adjacent to the red region in the map. Shwe is owned by Chinese and South Korean corporations. Not too far from that facility is a dream Chinese project, a deep sea port (called Kyauk Pyu).
China has also built oil and gas pipelines that extend from this very region all the way to China, as shown below:
Corporations from dozens of other countries – US, France, Canada, Japan, India and so on – have similarly carved up various parts of Myanmar. So what happens when corporations and countries build oil wells, offshore rigs, sea ports, railways, highways and fancy hotels for the foreign workers? Well, the native poor people have to be evacuated. This happens all over the world and often creates political, financial, and legal nightmares for the corporations. For one, many people may refuse to leave, especially farmers and fishermen whose livelihood depend on the land and the sea. Second, the corporations have to pay people who are willing to be relocated. Say, for example, the Myanmar law says the corporations have to pay $1,000 per person. For 100,000 people, that comes to $100 million.
Now, rather than paying these people or trying to deal with those who’re refusing to leave, what if the corporations could pay $1 million to some shady characters to drive those 100,000 people out of the area? That way, the corporations can save money, stay above the fray, and avoid any PR disaster.
Geopolitics
China has two goals vis-a-vis the Myanmar pipelines and deep sea ports. The first is obvious: import natural gas from Myanmar.
The second goal is a little more complex. It’s about…
a) Creating a shorter route for oil tankers and cargo ships from the Middle East and beyond, which can drop off the merchandise in Myanmar rather than having to go all the way around South East Asia. This saves 2000 miles or two weeks of travel.
b) The second reason is that China wants to lessen its dependence on the sea lanes in South China Sea and especially the path through the narrow Strait of Malacca, which can be quickly blocked if there’s a conflict or a war. And, yes, that hypothetical conflict would involve the U.S.
Wherever China’s Silk Road goes, the U.S. is going to follow it, and Myanmar is no exception. For example, WikiLeaks emails exposed how the CIA funded “grassroots” organization in Myanmar to disrupt a Chinese plan for a dam! Naughty as usual. Edward Snowden also revealed how the NSA uses the US embassy in Myanmar as a spy central to snoop on all the countries in that region.
The fundamental goal of the U.S. is to pull Myanmar away from China’s sphere of influence. And if that can’t be accomplished, then chaos will be manufactured.
What else is in the CIA’s tool bag to destabilize a country? Islamic extremism and various avatars of the Mujahideen project. We have seen that in Syria and also recently in the Philippines. Which brings us to the puppet master, Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Wahhabism
Saudi Arabia’s biggest exports are oil and Wahhabism. One of the Asian victims of Saudi Wahhabism is Bangladesh, which has turned extremist in the recent years. Many progressive and secular bloggers and writers have been murdered in the last few years; ISIS and other Islamic terrorist groups (ABT, JMB) have targeted foreigners – for example, three Americans were hacked to death last year; and extremists have demolished many churches and Buddhist temples. As Bangladesh gets radicalized, so do Rohingya Muslims who live just across the border.
Rohingya separatist/militant/terrorist groups demand an Islamic state and have killed Myanmar soldiers, burned down Buddhist temples, murdered Buddhists, etc. The leader of a powerful Rohingya terrorist group is a guy named Ata Ullah, and he is based out of Saudi Arabia. Other Rohingya leaders and insurgents are being trained by prominent terrorist groups in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
It’s also possible that poor and illiterate people are being used as weapons of mass immigration. 30-40 million people in Bangladesh earn less than $2/day. Are some of them being deliberately sent into the areas in Myanmar where Chinese infrastructure projects are happening?
Conclusion
Fake news corporate media uses atrocity propaganda to sell sensational stories, and politicians use faux outrage to bully Myanmar’s leaders. What we need instead is serious investigative journalism that exposes the multitude of players and their clandestine actions that are creating needless crisis in Myanmar and colossal suffering for the Rohingya people.

"In Hong Kong, It’s the Fans Who Protest During the National Anthem","Now the authorities are planning tougher measures. Last month, China’s legislature approved a law prohibiting disrespect of the anthem, barring the song’s use in commercials or parodies, and outlining punishments for people who do not “stand with respect” and “maintain a dignified bearing” when it is played.
Weekslong street protests in Hong Kong known as the Umbrella Movement ended three years ago without the government ceding any ground on expanding residents’ say in local elections.
But that spirit of protest has been revived in the stadium jeers, which appear to have started two years ago. Hong Kong played China in World Cup qualifiers twice in 2015, and those matches took on an added political dimension coming a year after the street protests.
Photo
With a population of seven million, Hong Kong is a minnow in the ocean of international soccer. But the city has a long history with the sport and, with the help of some foreign-born players, often punches above its weight.
China has a huge population to draw from and its teams have been successful in several sports. But its men’s soccer teams have routinely struggled in international competition.
In 1985, Hong Kong beat China, 2-1, in Beijing to eliminate the team from qualifying for the following year’s World Cup, setting off a riot. In the 2015 World Cup qualifiers, Hong Kong tied China twice. To add to the insult, the home fans booed the Chinese national anthem before the game in Hong Kong.
The world governing body for soccer, FIFA, fined the Hong Kong Football Association for fans booing during one of the China matches and also during a 2015 World Cup qualifier against Qatar. The city’s football association has called on fans to behave, and stewards make vain attempts to encourage hard-core supporters to keep quiet during the national anthem.

The anthem, “March of the Volunteers,” was a poem set to music in 1935, and it became popular as a call for resistance against Japan. Its lyricist, Tian Han, died in prison during the Cultural Revolution in 1968.
The anthem law went into effect on Oct. 1. But Hong Kong, a former British colony, maintains a semiautonomous existence that allows it to keep its own economic and legal systems. So Hong Kong will need to enact its own version of the law, which it has yet to do.

Thus far, Hong Kong fans are unbowed.
“We do it spontaneously because we don’t think we are part of the P.R.C.,” said Sanho Chung, 24, who was at Tuesday’s game, using an abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. “We are different.”
Rights activists and pro-democracy politicians are concerned that the law could be used to suppress free expression.
“I think it will be quite problematic to apply it,” said Dennis Kwok, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council.
Photo
He noted that the mainland law allows the police to place violators in administrative detention for 15 days. That method of incarceration, which bypasses the courts, does not exist in Hong Kong.
And the idea of showing reverence will be hard to define, he said. “What does it mean to be respectful of the national anthem?” Mr. Kwok said. “That concept of law is simply unheard-of here, to have to stand in silence. I think we need to be very careful defining what is respectful and what is not.”
Hong Kong officials say the national anthem law is a routine matter that should not prompt concern among residents.
“I just want to reiterate that, rightly so, we are living in a more politicized environment, but we need not adopt this very politicized stance in considering and dealing with any matter,” Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, said in August. “This particular matter of national anthem legislation does not carry any particular scope for politicization.”

In recent months, the authorities have taken several steps to punish people for protesting or for calling for Hong Kong’s independence. Now, even symbolic protests are being suppressed.
Last month, a lawmaker was fined 5,000 Hong Kong dollars, about $640, for turning upside down several small Hong Kong and Chinese flags on desks in the Legislative Council chamber.
And the appearance of posters calling for Hong Kong independence on a wall run by the student union at the Chinese University of Hong Kong set off debate between local and mainland students. School administrators and Hong Kong officials called the signs illegal, but legal scholars said it was questionable whether colonial-era sedition laws could be enforced.
“The introduction of a national anthem law is coming at a time when people who oppose symbols of the Chinese government and symbols of the Chinese Communist Party have reason to fear they could end up behind bars,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. “This could have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.”
On Tuesday at the match against Malaysia, Mr. Chung, clad in a red home jersey, stood with fellow fans during halftime. He said the national anthem law would not stop him from booing.
“It does dampen our freedom of speech, forcing us to respect something,” he said. “I worry, but I will still practice my rights. I think this is my right.”"

President Donald Trump and Melania Trump on Wednesday visit the civilian heroes and first responders of the mass shooting in Las Vegas. The president and first lady will first visit with patients and medical professionals at an undisclosed Las Vegas hospital then go to a separate location to meet and talk with first responders and civilian heroes from the massacre that left 59 dead including the shooter and more than 500 wounded. Coverage of the first couple’s visit to Las Vegas will begin at 11:50 AM PDT/2:50 PM EDT. On Sunday night, Stephen Craig Paddock rained a deadly hail of bullets onto a crowd attending a country music concert. The shooter’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, re-entered the United States Wednesday morning as a “person of interest” in the shooting. Her sister told reporters that Danley had been “sent away” to the Philippines just before the shooting. It is unclear if Marilou knew anything prior to the massacre, but law enforcement officials said that it had to have been planned for months in advance. The killer also wired at least $100,000 to the Philippines just before the attack. Police are still looking for a motive for the killing.

Storm Nate weakens but brings heavy rain,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Catfish in the streets as Nate floods US cities
Storm Nate has weakened to a tropical depression after bringing strong winds, heavy rain and some flooding to the south-eastern United States.
It made landfall as a hurricane twice, in Louisiana and Mississippi, and is currently over Alabama.
Storm surge warnings have been lifted across the region.
Nate killed at least 25 people in Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras. No deaths or injuries have yet been reported in the US.
Although it was not as strong as last month's Maria and Irma, the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Florida had issued warnings and evacuation orders ahead of its arrival.
'Minimal' damage
Film footage from Biloxi, Mississippi, where the storm made landfall, showed flooded streets and highways.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Storm surges displaced boats, vehicles and even this gazebo
But the waters quickly receded, leaving boats and vehicles marooned.
Mayor of nearby Gulfport, Billy Hewes, told the BBC the storm surge did not appear to be as high as feared and he thought the damage there would ""be minimal"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres: ""The origin is clear - we are facing the consequences of climate change""
Mississippi emergency official Greg Flynn told AP that more than 1,000 people in the state spent the night in shelters but no major damage had been reported.
In southern Alabama, the local power company said some 5,000 people were without power. Residents there had been urged to take precautions ahead of Nate's arrival.
A mandatory curfew was lifted in New Orleans, Louisiana, as the threat to the city - devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - was downgraded.
Nate was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm by the National Hurricane Center at 09:00 GMT on Sunday, and later to a tropical depression.
Warnings of storm surge flooding were lifted on Sunday afternoon.

Five ports along the Gulf Coast were also closed to shipping as a precaution ahead of Nate's arrival. Most oil and gas platforms in the US Gulf of Mexico also evacuated their staff, but are now planning to reopen.
US President Donald Trump on Saturday issued an emergency declaration for Louisiana and Mississippi, allowing the state to seek federal help with preparation and possible relief efforts.
Nate's deadly impact in Central America
Nate caused heavy rains, landslides and floods which blocked roads, destroyed bridges and damaged houses as it tore through central America.
At least 13 people died in Nicaragua, eight in Costa Rica, three in Honduras and one in El Salvador.
The tail of the storm is still causing problems in the region, where thousands have been forced to sleep in shelters and some 400,000 people in Costa Rica were reported to be without running water.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, visiting Antigua and Barbuda which were badly damaged by Hurricane Irma in September, said the international community needed to do more to help Caribbean countries hit by a series of powerful hurricanes.
""There is an increasing intensity of hurricanes, an increasing frequency, and increasing devastation,"" he told the BBC. ""The origin is clear - we are facing the consequences of climate change.""

Europe Open Championships: England beat Wales to retain title,"World number three side England were the highest-ranked team in the tournament
England retained their Europe Open Championships title with a 72-50 victory over hosts Wales.
England, who beat Scotland, Northern Ireland and Fiji earlier in the tournament, maintained their 100% record with a comprehensive win on the final day in Cardiff.
Wales struggled against England's relentless defence as Natalie Haythornthwaite dominated their attack.
Northern Ireland narrowly beat Scotland 46-45 in the silver medal match.
Goal shooter Lisa Bowman netted in the dying seconds with her side down to six players to seal second place and relegate Scotland to the bronze medal.
But England, who sent a relatively inexperienced squad to the tournament, defended the title they won in Newcastle last year in style.
Led by captain Sasha Corbin, they handed debuts to six players across the weekend - Josie Huckle, Vicki Oyesola, Gabby Marshall, George Fisher, Summer Artman and Sophie Drakeford-Lewis.
England now play a three-match series against Malawi in November before the four home nations compete at the Commonwealth Games on Australia's Gold Coast in April 2018.
Wales captain Suzy Drane told BBC Radio Wales:
""We've got a lot of fresh blood coming through and we're reuniting some of the girls that are coming back in from previous times.
""So we've got a lots to take from the England game and we're very-much focusing on us, especially after the three games we've played in the tournament.
""The bottom line is we need to look at our play and make sure we play our game better for longer."""

One win doesn’t change the fact that the team is still rebuilding and trying to build a young core going forward. But through the first three games there are some trends that bear watching:
– The offensive staff has shown an ability to adjust on the fly to get the offense stabilized. Whether it’s been using 6-7 OLinemen to establish the run or TE & FB to chip pass rushers.
– The OLine (all 28 and under) has been very good in pass protection and improving in run blocking. And the fact that the staff has mixed and matched them in various aliments shows we may actually have depth.
– The TE position could actually be a big time strength with Seferian-Jenkins, Tye and Leggett (once healthy). The inline blocking of the position has surprised me.
– The acquisition of Kearse the continued development of Anderson and the flashes Stewart show give me hope for a nice corps of WR. But the staff MUST use Stewart & Hansen more, if we have those four and a healthy Enunwa next year we may have something.
– Forte looks slower than last year, Powell and McGuire need to be the primary RB’s going forward.
– Will the defense continue to stay true to their assignments? They absolutely detroyed MIA who has a lot of weapons and a good OLine just by doing their jobs. Can they keep it up? Because it’s amazing how good our ILB’s looked once everyone maintained their gaps and tackled. It’s also crucial because a sound defense allows Adams to be used all over the field as highlighted in Cimini’s article.

Kids & Fitness....Get the Kids Off the Couch & Have Some Fun!,"Kids & Fitness….Get the Kids Off the Couch & Have Some Fun!
(Before It's News)
We live in a time when there are too many things kids can do to entertain themselves while remaining inactive: television and movies, smart phones, video games and social media and of course what my kid loves to do…sleep!
So how can you get your kids to jump off the couch, put down whatever electronic device they’re holding, and join you for a bit of good old fashioned exercise?
The Right Approach
Encourage your kids to exercise! Experience tell us the best way to get your kids to exercise is to set a positive example. So you have to get the party started…grab your FlexFit Mat, lay it out in the living room floor, and invite your kids to join you. Whether or not they do so (they probably won’t at first), make sure you run through some exercises of your own.
Young children love to spend time with their parents, and the more they see you exercising without them, the more they will want to come and join you. For older kids, you might have to work better Jedi mind tricks on them and make it challenging. Competition works great: see who can do the most sit-ups, push-ups, or plank the longest (hint: let them win a few times). Keep a chart in the kitchen with daily results and create an end-of-summer reward.
Make it Fun!
When your kids finally do join you, be sure to make your workout as fun as possible! You could get ambitious like this dad who created a American Ninja Warrior obstacle course for his daughter in the backyard!
For the parents that don’t have the time or resources to make their own mini Mount Midoriyama at home, try setting up a series of exercises that tell a story, or turn on some music and invent a new dance, or create your own iron-kid contest. Use your imagination! After a while, you might be surprised to see how much your kids look forward to working out with you."
United States Trade Deficit Shrinks in August as Exports Rise,"Economists caution against reading too much into the trade deficit, particularly monthly swings, as a measure of the administration’s success in extending America’s prowess in global trade. That’s because the trade deficit is more closely linked with multiple macroeconomic factors — like the relative growth rates of countries, the value of currencies, the strength of the United States dollar as a global reserve currency, and global trends in savings and investment.
A better measure of success for Mr. Trump’s America-first policy, economists say, would be putting more Americans to work, and rising growth and productivity gains over all.

The White House and the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Many economists do not see the trade gap as a negative. Bryan Riley, an economist at the Heritage Foundation who advocates free trade, said the trade deficit is not necessarily a sign of trouble. It can be good or bad, depending on the circumstances. Mr. Riley points out that in recent years, the economy has grown faster at times when the trade deficit was getting bigger, and slower at times when it was getting smaller.
Mr. Riley said the administration’s tax policies may actually have greater impact on the trade deficit than trade policy if changes to the tax code end up making the United States economy more competitive and attract more investment.
While the Trump administration would consider such tax changes to be a success, Mr. Riley said they might make the United States trade deficit even bigger — if, for example, lower taxes expand economic growth, which gives Americans more money to buy goods from abroad, or incentivizes foreigners to invest more in the United States.
Not every economist thinks that a trade deficit is harmless. Some, especially those on the left, see persistent imbalances as a potentially troubling sign that the United States has lost manufacturing jobs to other countries.
Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden, said that while the president should not look to trade deficits as a “scorecard” from month-to-month, Mr. Trump “was onto something” with his intuition that persistent trade deficits reflected a structural problem of fewer goods being produced in the United States and fewer manufacturing jobs.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But Mr. Bernstein agrees it will be difficult for the president’s actions to have much influence on trade flows, which are determined by bigger economic factors. He predicted that the country’s trade balance would probably be pretty similar when Mr. Trump leaves office as when the president came in. As powerful as the president and economic policy can be, they pale in comparison to millions of American consumers and producers — and the multinational supply chains that have long existed to serve those needs.
“Cargo ships aren’t going to disappear because of saber rattling,” Mr. Bernstein said. “You actually have to implement pretty drastic policies to disrupt these flows, which are embedded in the global economy. The things you’ve heard them talking about are pretty marginal.”
That seems unlikely to dissuade Mr. Trump from citing the metric. On Monday, Mr. Trump told Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister of Thailand, that he wanted to reduce the United States trade deficit with that country. “I think we’re going to try and sell a little bit more to you now,” the president said."
Golf: Steele rallies to defend Safeway title,"FILE PHOTO: Sep 14, 2017; Lake Forest, IL, USA; Brendan Steele tees off on the 4th hole during the first round of the BMW Championship golf tournament at Conway Farms Golf Club. Thomas J. Russo-USA TODAY Sports
(Reuters) - Brendan Steele rallied in windy conditions to successfully defend his title at the Safeway Open in California on Sunday and become the tournament’s first repeat winner.
Steele, who began the day two strokes back, shot a three-under 69 in the final round to reach 15-under and claim a two-stroke victory over fellow American Tony Finau in the PGA Tour’s season-opener.
“(There) was a brutal wind today,” Steele told reporters after sealing the win with birdies on the 16th and 18th holes.
“Lots of holes into the wind, lots of uncomfortable shots.”
Overnight leader Tyler Duncan, playing in just his second PGA Tour tournament, faded with bogeys on his first three holes and finished four back at 11-under after a 75.
Finau eagled the par-five fifth but ultimately faded with a double bogey on the 14th.
A birdie on the final hole secured him outright second.
Phil Mickelson shot a 70 to finish in a tie for third with Chesson Hadley at 12-under.
“I had a good time today,” Mickelson said. “It was fun to be in the mix, it was fun to have a chance.
“It was very difficult conditions. I enjoy that challenge. This course played totally different with the firm greens and the wind and some of the high pin placements were tough to get to.”

North Korea Prepares For Battle,"North Korea is preparing for an attack and relocating aircraft to the country's east coast.
 
The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the communist country has also taken further measures to improve its defense capability.
 
Should we fear North Korea's Air Force?
 
 
North Korea accuses the US of having declared war on the country and threatens to shoot down American long-range bombers.
 
Only this weekend, the USA had sent long-range bombers to the international airspace east of the isolated country. It was the first time in this century that American fighter planes or bombers flew so far north of the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea.
 
US President Donald Trump's comments at the weekend were clearly a declaration of war, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said on Monday following the UN General Assembly in New York.
 
The massive maneuvers staged near the coast of North Korea are apparently meant to taunt the North Korean leader [Kim Jong-un], to provoke him into some sloppy action,
 
Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s non-proliferation and arms controls department, said on Tuesday as cited by Interfax.

Digging Up the Dead: Probing the Ruins of Mosul,"Ivor Prickett spent months on assignment for The New York Times in Mosul, Iraq, documenting the battle to recapture the city from Islamic State militants and the aftermath. See more of his reports from a city in ruin here.
— “This is the other arm. Was she wearing a black abaya?” Daoud Salem Mahmoud shouted as he lifted the bone from the rubble and held it out to the small group looking on. A piece of cloth still clung to the sinews. “This one is a black abaya.”
Mr. Mahmoud and a small band of men had picked carefully through the remains of a demolished city street of Mosul, digging through personal belongings and the crumbled walls of family homes.
The work was slow and laborious. They were searching for the dead.
Two months after the ferocious, nine-month battle to liberate Mosul from Islamic State militants, much of the city lay in ruins. Government forces supported by coalition planes had carried out repeated strikes, and the militants had fiercely defended their positions. Thousands may have died in the fighting, many lying uncounted beneath the rubble.
Iraqi Civil Defense workers searching for the bodies of a family killed in airstrikes in June.
Civil Defense workers digging out the bodies of two people killed in their home during an airstrike.
Carrying a body out of a home.
Now that the fight has moved on, the city has turned it attention to recovering those bodies to return them to their families. That task has fallen to the city’s Civil Defense workers, mostly trained as firefighters and rescue workers.
The are focused on the devastated Old City district, where Islamic State fighters made their last stand. The workers move cautiously to avoid leftover bombs and unexploded suicide belts. In August, one of their officers was killed and three crew members were wounded when they disturbed explosives.
It took most of the day for a rotating crew of more than 10 men using an excavator to retrieve just two bodies. The men have months of work ahead of them.
This day, the crew worked slowly and methodically as Sondus Mazaal, her husband and her elderly aunt Nadhira Aziz waited anxiously for any signs of their relatives or their personal belongings.
Mrs. Aziz, the homeowner, sat in a plastic chair 15 feet from the excavator. At times she was engulfed in dust whipped up as the driver dumped mounds of stone and parts of her house beside her, but she refused to move.
She directed the driver and shouted at the men on the ground to retrieve books and bags that she saw poking out of the debris. By the end of the day she was surrounded by a pile of tattered belongings that she wanted to bring with her. When the men said they were unable to bring all of the belongings with them she almost refused to leave.
Nadhira Aziz watched as Iraqi Civil Defense workers dug out the bodies of her sister and niece from her house in the Old City where they were killed by an airstrike in June.
There are still dangers.
A week earlier, the men said, someone shot at them and immediately fled. It was hard to fathom how an ISIS fighter might still be alive months after the battle had ended, and in an area that was largely razed, but the men were on high alert.
The sprawling ancient quarter is now largely sealed off from residents who used to live there, but soon after the crew arrived on this recent morning, some of the group began shouting.
They had come across a young man hiding in a partially collapsed building. He had managed to survive in an area cut off from the rest of the city months after the fight had ended. He denied being an ISIS fighter. But he was found with a mobile phone, some money and four automatic rifle magazines.
A man suspected of being an Islamic State militant was found hiding in the rubble.
Sondus Mazaal directed a recovery crew to the locations of the buried bodies of her mother and sister.
An Iraqi Civil Defense worker who had been digging for the bodies of two civilians throwing an unexploded suicide belt into the Tigris.
The men handed him over to the federal police unit stationed nearby and continued their work.
They haven’t been paid in months, but see this as their duty to the community, said Rabia Ibrahim Hassan, who is leading the recovery efforts. “We will continue until we have finished our work here,” Mr. Hassan said.
Earlier in the day, Mrs. Mazaal had confirmed that the arm bone belonged to her sister. Now, after hours of digging, the crew found her mother in what was once a basement.
Iraqi Civil Defense workers recovered the body of Sondus Mazaal’s mother, who was killed by an airstrike in Mosul’s Old City in June.
Much of the room was still intact, a shelving unit standing along one wall. Her body was almost fully intact, but heavily decomposed after months buried under debris.
Three men worked delicately, digging by hand to remove the mortar and twisted metal around her body. They wanted to remove her body as carefully as possible.
It took most of the day for a rotating crew of more than ten men using an excavator to retrieve just these two bodies. The men have months of work ahead of them.
There was no time to grieve as the men carried the three bodies through the destroyed streets over piles of masonry, past uncleared improvised explosives.
They are also being asked to retrieve those who were hastily buried during the months of fighting before their families fled.
Five members of Fouad Mohammed Sadi’s family died during one week in June. As the push to retake the Old City was in full swing, his wife, his 10-year-old daughter and his brother’s wife were killed when their house was hit by what he believed was a heavy artillery strike aimed at targeting ISIS militants in the area.
“They told us to stay at home and then they bombed us,” Mr. Sadi said.
Mr. Sadi and his brother survived and early the next morning, under continued shelling, buried the bodies before they fled. Mr. Sadi has one remaining daughter and they now live with relatives on the east side of Mosul.
He returned with the Civil Defense to the spot where he had buried his family to exhume their bodies from the shallow grave on the outskirts of the Old City and give them a proper burial.
Leyla Hasan Said sat beside the bodies of five of her relatives and others belonging to another family after workers recovered their remains.
Iraqi Civil Defense workers and Mr. Sadi’s relatives carried the bodies of his wife, daughter and sister-in-law through his heavily destroyed neighborhood in the Old City.
Mr. Sadi wept as helped to lower the bodies of his wife, daughter and two brothers into the ground.
Under Mr. Sadi’s direction, the team of ten men dug into the rocky ground. It didn’t take them long to hit the wooden panels Mr. Sadi had used to crudely cover the bodies. The men removed the remains and placed them in white body bags, as Mr. Sadi leaned in to try and identify his family. There was no time to grieve as the men carried the three bodies through the destroyed streets over piles of masonry, past uncleared improvised explosives.
Mr. Sadi’s two brothers were killed that same week in June, when their home was brought down by an airstrike aimed at targeting ISIS militants in the area. On the same day he dug up the bodies of his wife and daughter, he watched as the Civil Defense workers recovered the remains of his two brothers from what was left of their house.
Before the sunset, Mr. Sadi buried them in four graves, side-by-side in a cemetery in western Mosul.
He never broke down, but he wept quietly throughout the day as he kept himself busy directing the workers.
As he placed the bodies of his wife and daughter into the ground, he dropped his head and stood inside the grave for a moment. It seemed like he might never come out of the hole.
But he still had to bury his brothers."

(Before It's News)
Coming off the heels of a 20-6 victory against the Miami Dolphins in a game that some felt could end up being their only win of the season, the Jets came out and looked fantastic on defense once again, while their suddenly explosive offense did enough to get them a 23-20 win in overtime.
We talked about the lengthy list of outstanding performers last week and the list is equally impressive this week, so without further ado, the Jets top players from yesterday’s win:
DL Kony Ealy: According to PFF.com, Ealy was the first defensive lineman to have four batted passes in a game since 2015. Ealy also came away with an interception on a ball that he tipped straight up in the air. Ealy also added 3 quarterback pressures. It was an outstanding effort from Ealy we would later learn was dealing the the death of his sister earlier in the week. You can’t say enough about the effort he gave under those circumstances.
RB’s Bilal Powell and Elijah McGuire:
We could list them individually as Powell and McGuire were both fantastic, combining for 256 yards on 31 carries, an average of 8.2 yards per carry. Powell’s long of 75 yards was the second-longest run in team history, and McGuire added a 69-yard scamper of his own.
Elijah McGuire had 131 yards from scrimmage (93 rushing/38 receiving).
S Jamal Adams:
Once again, Adams was all over the field and seemingly flawless in coverage in a 5 tackle performance (3 solo). His career is only four games old, but it’s clear to any objective observer that he’s going to be a great one. He’s been used as a box safety, a coverage safety, a man cornerback and a linebacker. He has done all with no problems whatsoever.
S Marcus Maye:
While Maye was steady in run support leading all DB’s with 5 tackles, the safety is also a big reason why the Jets secondary has been so much better than the unit that was abysmal last season. In 2016 the Jets secondary allowed seven TD passes of 40 yards or more and four of those came in their first four games. Through four games this season, the longest opposing TD pass was Jay Cutler’s 3-yard toss that came as time expired last week. Maye is a big reason for that.
LB/FB Lawrence Thomas:
Over the past two weeks, Thomas has gone from rotational defensive lineman, to key versatile contributor. A former college fullback, Thomas has gotten some reps there over the past two weeks and has absolutely blown up defenders to spring Jets backs for big runs. Credit to John Morton for adding this wrinkle to his attack, because now a team that was thought to have no fullback at all, may have a pretty good one in Thomas.
Leonard Williams has been a big part of the Jets improved defense over the past two weeks.
DL Leonard Williams:
Once again Williams failed to get to the quarterback, but he was in on 7 tackles (3 solo) with several coming within a yard or two of the line of scrimmage. He’s still playing on a bum wrist but Williams’ improvement since a stinker in week two is a big reason why the Jets defense has given up just two touchdowns in the last two weeks.
OLB David Bass:
Having mentioned the impact of Leonard Williams above, you can’t not show some love to David Bass, who the team singed just a couple of weeks ago. For the second time in as many weeks, Bass was a factor coming off the edge and came away with multiple pressures and a sack. You can add Bass to a list of impressive low-risk acquisitions who are paying big dividends for the Jets at the moment.
Brent Qvale:
The entire O-line deserves a ton of credit in this game, but Qvale was a concern coming in for his first start of the season against Jacksonville’s front seven which is viewed as one of the best in the NFL. Minus a couple of hiccups, Josh McCown had plenty of time to throw throughout the day and the run game was dominant. The tone was set on the first drive when despite not coming away with any points, the Jets line stonewalled the Jaguars pass rush and Qvale was a big part of that. You knew if the line held up that well the rest of the way, the Jets were going to have a shot.
WR Robby Anderson:
No, Anderson’s stat line won’t blow you away (3 receptions, 59 yards), but he smoked an elite corner in AJ Bouye for a 41-yard catch and continues to show he can make plays against opposing team’s top cornerbacks. Not half bad for an undrafted free agent in his second season.
It’s been said time and again over the past several months that this season is about the development of this team’s young players. As it turns out, they’re developing a bit faster than many anticipated, and now they’ve got a shot to be over .500 at 3-2 if they can beat the Cleveland Browns on the road next Sunday. Enjoy it while it lasts, Jets fans.

Americans for Prosperity launched an ad campaign Thursday buying $45 million in ad time to pressure three red-state Democrats to support President Donald Trump’s tax reform initiative. The Koch-affiliated group, will layout money for ads in Indiana, Missouri, and Wisconsin the home states of Joe Donnelly, Claire McCaskill and Tammy Baldwin. This is just the first wave of pro-tax reform ad spending according to a representative of the group. The three Democrats face a difficult re-election if they don’t support the GOP plan as they herald from states that supported Trump in 2016. Donnelly and McCaskill have both personally accompanied the president to events where he told the crowd to vote them out if they don’t support his tax reform effort.

Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn expects Tyrrell Hatton to make Europe's side,"Thomas Bjorn's side will face a star-studded US team in Paris next year
European captain Thomas Bjorn expects England's Tyrrell Hatton to be in his Ryder Cup side next year after watching him defend his Dunhill Links title.
Hatton, 25, missed the cut at all four majors this year, but won his second European Tour title by finishing three shots clear of Ross Fisher in Scotland.
Bjorn believes the High Wycombe player can ""achieve great things"" in the game.
""He's a wonderful player and he's got a great attitude towards the game,"" Bjorn told BBC Three Counties Radio.
""He's aggressive in his mind, he wants to achieve things and sometimes that might come across like people think he's too aggressive, but that's what you want from your players.
""You want young players that want to get out there and be the best they can be.""
The 2018 Ryder Cup will take place at Golf National on the outskirts of Paris from 28-30 September, with Bjorn selecting four wild cards to join the eight automatic qualifiers.
Hatton - who would be making his debut if he faces the US in France next autumn - is at the top of the early points table, with the qualifying period beginning just over a month ago.
He began the final day of the Dunhill Links on the Old Course five shots ahead of the field and fired a six-under 66 to retain his title on 24 under.
""Performances like his at the weekend are very special and for the very few,"" Bjorn said.
""He really has risen and become a player that has a very good chance of not just being there [at the Ryder Cup] in 12 months, but in general has a good chance of achieving great things."""

'Too good for this world': Las Vegas victims mourned,"Some died with loved ones, some with friends. Others were with ""framily"" — friends they considered family — when they were shot and killed.
All shared the terror caused by a gunman spraying bullets into a crowd of concertgoers from a high-rise hotel in Las Vegas, ending a day of dancing and smiles with bloody horror.
Here are stories about some of the 58 people who didn't make it out alive.
LIFE OF 'GENTLE SPIRIT' REVOLVED AROUND MUSIC
Victor Link was doing one of the things he most enjoyed with the person he most enjoyed being with — his fiancee, Lynne Gonzales — when automatic gunfire peppered a huge crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas.
Link, 55, Gonzales, and two of their close friends were there to hear country music when he was shot.
A ""gentle spirit"" was lost with Link's death, said his older brother, Craig Link, 58.
""He was somebody that everybody loved,"" Craig Link told The Associated Press on Thursday. ""Victor had a gentle spirit, a loving spirit. He was giver. He was always there for any of his friends or family. If he could, he would help out wherever he could. He was a good man.
""He was my younger brother, but I always aspired to be him.""
The brothers grew up northwest of Bakersfield in Shafter, California. As teens, much of their young lives revolved around music, going to concerts and cars.
Victor Link and Gonzales, who wasn't hurt in Sunday's shooting, had been to several country music concerts over the last several years. Going to concerts ""was their favorite thing to do,"" Craig Link said.
""He was so blessed to have Lynne in his life,"" Craig Link said. ""Those two had an amazing love that very, very few people are blessed to understand and enjoy.""
In addition to Craig Link and Gonzales, Victor Link is survived by a son, Christian; his father, Loyd; another brother, Vincent; and a sister, Lisa Link Hiestand.
DISNEY WORKERS AMONG VICTIMS IN SHOOTING
Carrie Barnette, 34, was a Disneyland food service worker who never lost her sense of wonder for things like hummingbirds, according to her friends and family.
Barnette, of Riverside, California, was part of the culinary team at Disney California Adventure for 10 years.
Disney Chairman and CEO Robert Iger said in a statement that she was ""beloved by her friends and colleagues.""
""We are especially heartbroken over the loss of one of our own to this unconscionable and senseless act,"" Iger said. Another Disney cast member, Jessica Milam, was seriously injured in the mass shooting at the country music festival in Las Vegas over the weekend.
Joey Castillo, who is married to Barnette's younger sister, told the Orange County Register that Barnette loved hummingbirds because she saw them as a sign that her belated grandparents were watching over them.
""She was always happy and loved her grandparents with who she's now with up in heaven,"" he said. ""She will be greatly missed.""
'FRAMILY' GROUP MISSING A MEMBER
Nicol Kimura, 38, went to the festival with a group of seven men and women who call themselves ""framily"" — friends who are like family. She was fatally shot seconds after the gunfire began, said Ryan Miller, a businessman and pastor who is part of the group.
A Southern California native who lived in Placentia, Kimura's survivors include her parents, a sister and the friends who were with her when she died. She was single and didn't have children, but she was treated like family by the kids of group members, Miller said.
""She was a mom to all of our kids; they called her 'auntie,'"" he said. ""I have two kids myself, and they were just absolutely devastated that they will not be able to see her again.""
Kimura worked in a tax office for Orange County and spent most weekends with her friends. No one else in the group was shot.
""She was just such an amazing woman and she was just such a light,"" he said.
HE WAS 'TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD'
Brian Fraser, a father of four, was moving toward the stage in anticipation of Jason Aldean playing his favorite song, ""Dirt Road Anthem,"" when gunshots rang out.
While others around him ducked for safety, Fraser looked around to try to spot where the shots were coming from, so that he could shield his wife. He died doing just that, his son, Nick Arellano, said.
Fraser's friend ushered their wives and friends to safety before rushing back to perform CPR on Fraser. A doctor and several nurses in the crowd came to help, eventually loading Fraser into a wheelbarrow and taking him to paramedics.
Arellano recounted the story as told to him by his wife, his mother, and family friends. Arellano had been at the concert with them for the prior two days, but chose to head home early, just missing the harrowing scene.
Arellano described Fraser, 39, as ""the definition of American,"" a man who boated, hunted, fished and snowboarded. Fraser married his wife, Stephanie, 11 years ago, adopting Arellano and one of her other children.
The couple had two more children together, now ages 4 and 10. The family lives in La Palma, California.
""He taught me what it meant to be an honest, motivated, driven, loving man to not only family and friends, but even to just strangers, or anyone he came in contact with — just to be a human being to everyone on this planet,"" Arellano said.
MOM WAS ENJOYING WEEKEND AWAY WITH GIRLFRIENDS
A few hours before the shooting, Lisa Patterson called her husband to tell him what a great time she was having with her girlfriends — one of the rare weekends she was not coaching one of her kids' softball teams or volunteering at a school or church event.
Her husband, Bob Patterson, told his wife, a country music lover, to enjoy herself and stay for the last band, assuring her he could get their kids off to school the next morning.
It was the last time Bob Patterson spoke to his wife. After news broke of the shooting spree, he spent the night calling hospitals trying to find her. By 6 a.m. Monday, he and his 16-year-old son, Robert, jumped in the car and drove three hours from their Los Angeles suburb to Las Vegas to find her. His 19-year-old daughter, Amber, drove over from Arizona.
They spent 10 hours searching. Late Monday, Bob Patterson was approached by an official at the Las Vegas convention center, where the coroner's office set up operations to have more space where families could come to identify those who died.
""My children who had been waiting 100 feet outside the room, knew when I came back out that she had died by the look on my face,"" he said. ""My oldest daughter instantly broke down and fell on the ground crying.""
Patterson was given his wife's blood-stained purse, her cellphone and wrist band she wore to get into festival, but little information.
""I have not been told yet how she died,"" said Patterson on Wednesday as he planned a funeral for his 46-year-old wife in their home town of Lomita next Friday at their Catholic church.
After he and his children headed home to Lomita, he told his 8-year-old daughter, Brooke, that ""mommy passed away.""
He said since she is so young, she seems to be taking it the best out of all of them.
Bob Patterson met his wife when she was 18 and immediately was taken by her beauty, he said. They dated for seven years and were married for 21 years. They opened a hardware flooring store together. They were always together, he said, whether it was running their business, helping at their church, volunteering at school or coaching the many sports their kids did.
""My wife loved life, loved helping and there is nothing she would not do to help someone,"" he said.
FRIENDS DIED AT CONCERT TOGETHER
Austin Davis, 29, and his parents had a bond ""unlike anything I've ever witnessed,"" Davis's friend Katelyn Hood wrote in an online fundraising post.
He was their only son. As soon as news came that he may have been shot, they headed straight from their home in Riverside, California, to Las Vegas. They waited for 20 hours before learning that he had been killed, Hood wrote.
""They raised the best son,"" Hood wrote. ""He worked so very hard and took the most pride in that and anything he did.""
Through Hood, Davis's parents declined to be interviewed.
Davis also leaves behind his girlfriend of nine years, whom he met in high school. He was at the concert with his family friend, Thomas Day Jr., who also died.
A SEARCH FOR MOM, AND THEN HORROR
Laura Shipp raised her son Corey by herself, then moved to Las Vegas from Thousand Oaks, California, a few years ago to be closer to him. Both were country music fans, and they went to the Route 91 Harvest Festival together, said Laura Shipp's mother, Joyce Shipp.
They were together until just before a gunman opened fire Sunday night.
""We really don't know what happened, just that she went to the bathroom and nobody saw her after that,"" Joyce Shipp said of her 50-year-old daughter, a dispatcher at an air conditioner company.
After her son, a Marine Corps reservist, spent more than a day trying to find out what had happened to Shipp, he was notified she was dead.
""He's not doing great,"" Joyce Shipp said of her grandson. ""He's just trying to get his arms around all this but he's surrounded by his friends and family. We don't want to leave him alone at this time.""
MAN DIED IN BOYFRIEND'S ARMS
Cameron Robinson, 28, had been looking forward to attending the festival with his boyfriend for days, said friend and colleague Brad Jerbic.
Robinson was a records specialist for the city of Las Vegas, and his infectious personality made him the heart of the office, Jerbic, the city attorney, said Tuesday. Robinson had moved to southern Utah about a year ago to be with boyfriend Bobby Eardley, and commuted two hours each way to work every day.
""He was just so happy — you could see it in his face,"" Jerbic said. ""If he was alive, he would say this is the best time of his life.""
The couple was together when Robinson was shot in the neck and bled to death, Jerbic said. Eardley was also struck by shrapnel and suffered minor injuries.
""(Eardley) actually held him. He was with him when he died. He tried to stop the bleeding. There was so much chaos,"" Jerbic said.
YOUNGEST OF FOUR WANTED TO HELP OTHERS
Victim Michelle Vo, 32, was the youngest of four siblings in a family from the San Francisco Bay Area.
She worked hard at her job at New York Life insurance group in Pasadena, California, loved to cheer for the Golden State Warriors and was a pretty good golfer, said sister Cathy Vo Warren.
Warren remembered her sister as someone who always wanted to do good for those around her. ""You'd need a poet to tell you everything,"" said Cathy's husband, Paul Warren.
Born in Southern California, Vo was attending the Las Vegas concert by herself and befriended Kody Robertson. The two were together when Vo was shot. Robertson later helped relatives find her.
""We're very thankful that we met Kody,"" Warren said. ""We're very thankful for him to be there with Michelle so that she wasn't alone in her last moments.""
FESTIVAL GUARD DIED HELPING OTHERS
Erick Silva, 21, was working as a private security guard at the music festival when he was killed while trying to help people get out of the venue safely.
His close friend, Martin Adrian Marin Jr., said he was not surprised Silva died helping others. ""He would give the shirt off his back to comfort anyone,"" Marin said. ""He was such a courageous man.""
Marin has saved the last text message Silva sent to him that Sunday morning, before going to work at the festival.
""I want to wish you a lovely and productive day,"" Silva texted. ""Just know that I am always here.""
Silva would send text messages like that almost daily, Marin said.
""He was always so sweet and generous and caring,"" he said. ""It was not hard to fall in love with his personality.""
FATHER OF SIX KNOWN FOR BIG HEART, PERSONALITY
John Phippen was a father of six who was always willing to lend an ear — or a cold beer — to a friend in need.
""He had a heart that was larger than life and a personality to match,"" neighbor Leah Nagyivanyi wrote on an online fundraising page. ""You felt like you knew him for years the first time you met him.""
Nagyivanyi is raising money through GoFundMe to help Phippen's children pay for his funeral.
Phippen, 56, lived in Santa Clarita, California. The youngest of his six children, a daughter, is just 14.
SPORTS FAN DIED SHIELDING FRIEND'S WIFE
Chris Hazencomb, 44, of Camarillo, California, was a big sports fan. His mother, Maryanne Hazencomb, told the Ventura County Star she had him taken off a ventilator at 10:50 a.m. Monday.
Hazencomb was struck in the head while shielding his best friend's wife from bullets, his mother said.
He loved watching professional wrestling on TV every Monday night ""even though it's phony,"" Maryanne Hazencomb told the newspaper. He also loved football and followed the Los Angeles Rams.
Hazencomb was a graduate of Thousand Oaks High School.

"Ravens Fall to Steelers, 26-9 at Home","Ravens Fall to Steelers, 26-9 at Home
(Before It's News)
The Ravens fell to 2-2 today, losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-9 at M&T Bank Stadium. RSR Staff react to the loss here…
Derek Arnold
I was fine burning last week’s tape. But to lose like this, at home, to your bitter rival? That’s just inexcusable. It was the Steelers’ first win in Baltimore since 2012, and the 17-point margin of victory was their highest here…ever. Yup, ever. Second-most is now 13 in 2002. Great job, guys!
What is this team doing? The injuries are a legitimate factor, especially against playoff-caliber opponents, but the injuries aren’t making Joe Flacco throw off his back foot, nor are they making passes bounce off guys’ hands, nor making the offensive scheme resemble something from the stone ages.
As for the defense, they obviously aren’t as good as they looked playing the likes of Andy Dalton and DeShone Kizer, but I’d like to see what they can do when the offense doesn’t force them to be on the field for 20+ of the first 30 minutes of every ballgame.
The Ravens once again look like a rudderless ship. Those Jaguars that they made look like world-beaters a week ago? Yeah, they just lost to the Jets.
Ryan Jones
There a lot of things about this Ravens team that make you shake your head this week. How was this team not ready to play at home after last week’s embarrassment? How does the play calling remain something that resembles a high school team? How has a coach not addressed Joe Flacco‘s predictable cadence which would help keep opposing defenses off balance?
I catch a lot of flack for my consistent criticism of John Harbaugh and I understand the injuries. But this team will continue to exist in a state of mediocrity as long as Harbaugh is on the Ravens sideline. Harbaugh can’t find an offensive coordinator who can consistently put points on the board and he’s let Dean Pees stick around far too long. Enough with the excuses, this team is on its way to missing the playoffs for the third straight year and the fourth time in the last five years. That would get a coach dismissed from any other team in the NFL. The standard shouldn’t be different for Harbaugh.
Joe Polek
Injuries are decimating this team. They can’t stop the run without Brandon Williams and they can’t keep Flacco off the ground without Marshal Yanda. Flacco looks awful and I sure hope it has something to do with his back and this is not just because he is terrible. It doesn’t help that Ozzie hasn’t done anything to give Flacco help on the offensive of side of the ball for years. The defense gave up a lot of points but I still believe the offense is the reason we lost this game, and the reason this team will not go to the playoffs.
We’ll have more knee-jerk reactions as they roll in…ugh.

Las Vegas Attacker Tried to Blow up Massive Aviation Fuel Tanks,"(Before It's News)
This is terrorism. No question.
 
 
Imagine if those fuel tanks blew. Paddock would have blown up the city. The Las Vegas sheriff said that Paddock could not have done this alone.
 
Las Vegas Strip shooter targeted aviation fuel tanks, source says
Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...
 
 Review Journal, October 4, 2017:
 
 
 
Las Vegas Strip mass murderer Stephen Paddock used his Mandalay Bay hotel room to spray massive aviation fuel tanks with bullets Sunday night, a knowledgeable source told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
 
The bullets left holes, but did not penetrate the two circular white tanks, sparing the nearby Route 91 Harvest country music festival from a potentially massive explosion, the source said Wednesday.
 
The tanks are roughly 1,100 feet from the concert site, where Paddock killed 58 people and wounded almost 500.
 
Within the past couple of days, construction crews repaired and painted the holes, and FBI agents inspected the tanks and took measurements of the line of fire from Mandalay Bay, the source said.
 
Paddock, a 64-year-old Mesquite resident, had broken two windows in his 32nd-floor suite — one in line with the concert site and the other with a direct view of the fuel tanks, the source said. The bases of private aircraft operators are close to the tanks.
 
 
FBI spokeswoman Sandra Breault declined to comment. “We can’t comment on an ongoing investigation,” she said late Wednesday.
 
Paddock’s shooting rampage was the deadliest in modern U.S. history. He killed himself as Las Vegas police closed in on his room.
 
Paddock was a retired accountant who had no criminal background and a passion for video poker. He lived in Mesquite with his girlfriend, Marilou Danley, and regularly came to the Las Vegas Strip to gamble.

Lilly's breast cancer drug fails to help lung patients,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co said its recently approved breast cancer drug failed to meet a late-stage trial’s main goal of improving overall survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
The news comes as a blow to the drugmaker, which has suffered setbacks on two potential blockbuster treatments over the past year - the delay of a rheumatoid arthritis drug, as well as the failure of an experimental Alzheimer’s treatment.
A positive data in lung cancer patients would have given the drug, Verzenio, a competitive edge over rival breast cancer treatments such as Pfizer Inc’s Ibrance and Novartis AG Kisqali.
The drugmaker said on Tuesday that the late-stage trial was testing Verzenio in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with mutation of the KRAS gene, whose cancer has progressed despite initial therapies.
The drug, whose chemical name is abemaciclib, was being compared with Roche’s erlotinib, sold under the brand name Tarceva.
Verzenio belongs to a newer class of oral medicines called CDK 4/6 inhibitors that block cancer cells’ ability to divide and proliferate.
Last month, the FDA approved the drug to treat advanced breast cancer that has progressed following prior treatment.
Verzenio, however, showed some evidence of improvement in the latest trial’s secondary goals such as progression-free survival in patients and overall response rate, Lilly said.
The company currently has several ongoing trials evaluating Verzenio in non-small cell lung cancer, including a combination trial with Keytruda or chemotherapy, and does not plan to discontinue them, Guggenheim analyst Tony Butler wrote in a client note.
Lung cancer is by far the largest oncology market in the United States with Merck & Co Inc’s Keytruda leading the space.
Keytruda is an immuno-oncology drug, which works by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.
Lilly’s shares fell 1.2 percent to $85.99 in afternoon trade on Tuesday.
The company last month laid off 8 percent of its employees in order to save around $500 million a year and made significant changes to its management."

Painting on planes: Stunning sketches of airplane cabins,"(CNN) — What did you do on your last plane journey? Fall asleep, watch a movie, draft some emails?
Not architect John Gardner. A frequent business traveler, he's found a way to turn these journeys into an artistic outlet.
The Bermuda-based executive passes time on planes by sketching the sights and scenes he spies on board.
""Sketching is a nice alternative to taking pictures, as it is making something by hand -- and encourages really seeing and remembering and interpreting,"" Gardner tells CNN Travel.
Cabin creative
John Gardner sketches scenes from his airplane seat.
Gardner -- who trained at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) -- has a busy schedule that'll sound familiar to many business travelers.
""Right now, I'm teaching advanced architecture at the Rhode Island School of Design, and I'm going up every weekend to Boston from Bermuda,"" the 58-year-old explains.
""I'm doing two flights and two drawings a week,"" he says. ""I'm in an intense phase right now, which is kind of fun.""
Gardner's on-board artistic endeavors overlap with his day job, but they also allow the architect to experiment with a different medium.
""In my architectural job I'm imagining things, usually they're buildings and spaces,"" says Gardner. ""In this instance I'm drawing what I see.""
Gardner captures both intricate details and abstract scenes.
What Gardner sees includes profiles of other passengers, antics of the air stewards, stained coffee cups and crumbling pretzels, intricate detail of curtains and time spent in the terminal.
The results are eye-catching sketches, popping with color from his paints that capture life through the business traveler lens. Sometimes the sketches are abstract, evoking a general sense of the on-board experience with overlapping snapshots of air stewards' uniforms, laptops and fellow passengers.
Other times they're more detailed studies of intricate airline scenes.
""It's a creative release,"" Gardner says. ""I find the time on the plane is really very valuable because there's nothing else taking me away from where I am.""

Drawing inspiration
Gardner is particularly interested in the antics of the air stewards.
It's become a creative challenge for Gardner to search out prospects he's yet to paint.
""It is hard sketching and painting what is essentially the same view,"" he says. ""But the style can change and if I look hard enough or relax and just start drawing, interesting things reveal themselves.""
He particularly enjoys sketching flight attendants.
Gardner will ask his neighboring passengers if they mind being sketched.
""They're hard to draw as they're constantly moving,"" he explains. ""So what I'll actually do is I'll take a few pictures on my iPhone and I'll sketch them loosely and then I'll tighten it up.""
Gardner is full of praise for cabin crew.
""The flight attendants are amazing,"" he says. ""I've never had a bad experience. They get really interested in what I'm doing, so sometimes I give them my sketchbook and they go take it to the galley and take photos. Some of the sketches have their names on them.""
Fine art
Gardner says the humidity on board the plane is perfect for watercolor.
Surprisingly, Gardner says airplane conditions lend themselves perfectly to a spot of painting.
""The majority of my sketches are are pen and ink and watercolor,"" he says. ""The best thing about watercolor in planes is the humidity is very low, so you can paint and it dries very quickly, which is really nice.""
Gardner will sketch in every situation -- aside from take off and landing -- whatever cabin he ends up in.
Gardner, pictured here painting on board a plane, tries his best to sketch in all conditions.
""What I'll do is ask for two waters and a coffee -- I'll drink one water -- the other's for the paint,"" he says. ""I try really hard not to have an accident when it's a tight space!""
Naturally, it's always easier if he flies executive -- but in economy, aisle seats work best.
""It is virtually impossible to paint in the middle seat with two passengers on either side,"" says Gardner. ""Everything gets set out on top of the sketchbook and they get nervous the water will spill on them!""
However Gardner's fellow travelers are mostly unperturbed by his creative efforts -- even when they're the subject of his artistic eye.
""Passengers don't usually know I am drawing them and I ask if they are next to me,"" he says. ""They'll always say, 'yeah that's great.'""
Gardner will sketch subjects in the airport terminals, as well as on board.
In the terminal, Gardner will sketch faces from far away.
He's also become interested in the limited on-board lighting.
He lists inspirations as, ""the light from the windows, the pattern of the chairs, the red lights, the ubiquitous 'exit' signs, the food in front of you, the industrial engineering, the grays and blues.""
Related content Would you live in an airport for 30 days? One man is giving it a try
Worldwide feedback
Gardner has recently set up an Instagram account to share his sketches.
As every frequent flier knows, time on the plane can be draining and feel unfulfilling.
For Gardner, his sketches allows him to appreciate the everyday -- and find satisfaction in the mundane.
""It makes the memory of the flight particularly interesting,"" he says. ""More interesting than if I just got on and got off.
""I find at the end of the flight, I look at the sketch and it's revealed something about the environment I was in,"" says Gardner. ""Something I wasn't looking for, but it happened.""
Gardner's students at RISD inspired him to share his work.
Gardner has been sketching intensively for the past five years -- and he's kept a sketchbook since his student days at RISD -- but it's only recently that he's started sharing his work with a wider audience.
""I've been very private about my artwork, because I've really been an architect,"" he says.
""In the last few years I've just been exploring a bit more energy on my artwork, with the view of being a more serious artist.""
It was Gardner's undergraduates at RISD who encouraged him to share his sketches on social media.
""I was prompted by the younger generation,"" he says. ""And I was comfortable enough on my own terms that [my drawings] were ready to be out there.""
Now he's got a fledgling Instagram account, tagging his on board artwork with #paintingonplanes.
It's early days, Gardner's already inspired and excited by the virtual feedback.
""The response is this huge, worldwide array of people who pick up your work,"" he says. ""I think that's just fascinating, and then I see what they're interested in and it's this whole portal to having a broader perspective around the world of what's going on.""

Appreciating the everyday
Gardner finds painting on planes a rewarding and fun experience.
Gardner also encourages others to follow in his footsteps -- to find new ways to appreciate their commute and everyday routine, whether through sketching or other mediums.
The trick he says, is commitment and patience.
""The key is really to have a sketchbook and carry it with you everywhere,"" Gardner advises. ""When you get a spare moment, whether it's on the plane or in a café or waiting at the airport, just start doodling and drawing [...] you'll be amazed at where you'll end up in one, two or five years.""
For Gardner it's been a revolutionary experience."
Chicago Bears secondary comes up big in win over Pittsburgh,"Chicago Bears secondary comes up big in win over Pittsburgh
(Before It's News)
In a stunning upset on Sunday, the Chicago Bears beat the Pittsburgh Steeler 23-17 in overtime at Soldier Field. It was Chicago’s first win of the season and comes in a tough four-game stretch to open the year. With running backs Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen deserving the headlines with their big plays that led to the Bears winning, but it was the Bears defensive secondary that had a very impressive game. The secondary, which has been heavily scrutinized during the John Fox era, had one of their best performance if not their best performance against one of the NFL’s best offenses. The Steelers offense has been regarded as one of the best offenses in all of football as they have featured perennial pro-bowlers at each position on offense starting with the quarterback, running back and wide receiver. Ben Roethlisberger, Le’Veon Bell, and Antonio Brown have led the offense since 2013 and have put up crazy offensive numbers over that time, on Sunday that was not the case. On their first play of the game, the Steelers and Roethlisberger attempted to throw downfield to their deep threat wide receiver in Martavis Bryant. Bryant was wide open, but the pass was just out of his reach. That would be the only deep ball the Steelers to where their wide receivers were not covered. There were at least two more instances in the first half where the Roethlisberger attempted a deep pass down the sideline, and both times Bears defenders right there with the Pittsburgh wide receivers to defend the pass. One of the plays, which featured cornerback Marcus Cooper covering Antonio Brown was flagged for pass interference, The referees met and picked up the flag when they determined that Brown was out of bounds when trying to catch the ball. Later in the second quarter, cornerback Prince Amukamara had a nice pass defense against slot receiver Ju-Ju Smith-Schuster. For a defensive secondary known for giving up the big play late in the game over the years, it was late in the fourth quarter where the secondary came up big. With a tied score, The Steelers had the last possession of the game with 52 seconds left in regulation and were only able to move the ball 14 yards before letting time expire. This was huge for a secondary that in years past had given up big plays allowing the opposing team to win. Furthermore, the Steelers offense was unable to move the ball at all in the fourth quarter as their longest drive in the quarter was 44 yards which 37 yards were through the air. The pass defense numbers for the Bears defense were very noteworthy as Pittsburgh’s longest pass in the game was for 25 yards and that came late in the 4th quarter. They were able to limit receiver Martavis Bryant to just two receptions for 30 yards when just last week Bryant three receptions for 91 yards and a touchdown. Also limited to an extent, was Antonio Brown who was held to 10 receptions for 110 yards and just a touchdown. He averaged just 11 yards per catch which were his lowest so far this season. This was just only the fourth time in the Steelers last 19 games to where they were held to less than 300 yards on offense as they finished with 282 total yards on offense Sunday. The Bears running game won the game for the team on Sunday, but it was the defense that kept them in the game as the offense was unable to score any points in the second half. Going forward, the performance by the defensive secondary is key to note because of just how far they have come since 2015 and just how good they can be for the rest of season. If the secondary can play as good as they did against a high power offense such as the Steelers, it’s hard not to imagine the defense being able to play consistently well against any remaining opponents. With a Bears offense that has struggled to move the ball, any game is winnable for the team as long as the defense and especially the secondary is up for the task.

Rams Upset Cowboys on the Road,"Rams Upset Cowboys on the Road
(Before It's News)
It was a tale of 2 halves. The Rams were clearly outplayed in the first half, but despite the Cowboys dropping 3 TDs on the Rams in the 2nd quarter, the score going into halftime was only Rams 16 – Cowboys 24. In the second half a different Rams squad came onto the field. In the second half the Rams defense rose up and controlled the Cowboys offense. With a little more than 9 minutes remaining in the game the Rams had scored 19 unanswered points. The Rams then got conservation right at the end of the 4th which could have been costly. In the last 3 minutes they had a decision to play for the win or play it safe and settle for a FG. They played it safe which in my book was the wrong call. Luckily, the Rams defense did their jobs and forced the Cowboys to give up the ball on downs. Game over baby.
Main contributors in Rams victory:
1 Special teams play – Pharoh Cooper had 4 returns for a total of 123 yards. Good field position makes a difference in both moral and the pace of the game. And kicker Greg Zuerlein had a record setting performance kicking 7 field goals in a single game. 3 of those field goals were over 40 yards.
2 The Rams defense came up big. In the 4th quarter ILB Mark Barron came up with a clutch interception keeping the Cowboys from building momentum. The Rams defense put a lot of pressure on Cowboys QB Prescott and sacked him 3 times on the day.
3 Todd Gurley and Todd Gurley – Why 2 Todd Gurley’s? Because Gurley had a major impact on both the running game and the receiving game. On the ground he rushed 23 times for 121 yards. In the air he went 7 for 94 and a wicked 53 yard TD reception in the 3rd quarter.
The Rams continue to receive strong contributions from rookie WR Cooper Kupp who today chipped in another 5 receptions for 60 yards and a TD.
Not only are the Rams proving for the first time in many years they have a competent offense, they’re also starting to show signs of character. Signs of a winning character. Today’s victory gives us a 3-1 record and puts us at the top of the NFC West. Next week the Rams go back home and take on the vulnerable Seahawks. That should be an exciting contest. Have a great week Rams fans. Go Rams!!!

Brazilian senator blows the whistle about Nibiru and Planet X,"Why are we facing natural disasters of unprecedented strength? Many recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have been some of the strongest ever recorded.
 
Is this merely a matter of chance and not a real trend that we have to worry about? Is global warming to blame for the increasingly destructive weather? Or is there something more mysterious going on, that we are not supposed to know about?
 
Is a series of natural disasters about to destroy civilization?
 
A Brazilian senator has recently claimed that the dangerous weather patterns of recent years are something to be more than a little bit afraid of. The senator claims to be aware of secret NASA information about a planet named Nibiru, which will soon pass close to the earth and cause catastrophic natural disasters.
 
The gravity of this not publicly known planet will affect the tides and winds of the earth, resulting in a natural catastrophe worse than any in recorded history. Senator Mota claims that the impact on the earth will be so severe that two-thirds of the world population will die and our civilization will not survive. While senator Mota has of course been ridiculed for his statements, he also has his defenders. Why would he risk his reputation unless what he is warning us about is at least partly true?
 
Mota is not the first to talk about what is known as Nibiru or Planet X. It has been talked about on the internet for years, with the theory having its roots in alien abduction claims in the mid-1990s. The theory does sound far-fetched. However, there is some evidence that similar events may have happened on earth in the distant past. If the biblical parting of the red sea did occur, could it have happened as a result of a large celestial object passing near the Earth? In any case, we will know whether or not there is any truth about these claims soon because it is in the fall of 2017 that the encounter is predicted to occur.

The Yankees just didn’t have a clue on how to hit him last night and poor Sonny Gray can never get run support. I can’t believe it. My 15 year old said to me early in the day,

“If Gray gets no run support like always, the Yanks can’t win this game, and after Kluber on Friday night, you can pretty much kiss the Yankees Playoffs goodbye.”
While we haven’t faced Kluber yet tonight… it’s my belief that my 15 year old needs to be a baseball commentator somewhere. He’s that good, that smart and worthy of a gig somewhere.

Me? I just assumed the Yankee bats would come alive based on adrenaline and at least fight back against the Indians. But playing in Cleveland is never easy… and winning against the Indians is sometimes impossible.
Photo: Getty Images
I really don’t have much to say about last night other than we gotta move forward and go hard tonight. CC Sabathia is a veteran pitcher and no question has found his groove this season to be one of the better, more dependable pitchers on the Yankee staff. But Corey Kluber is a monster too, and playing in Cleveland, there is no question the fans there will try to get into the older, former Indian pitcher’s head. CC knows this… but CC is a gamer, and I hope he can right the ship for the Yankees tonight.
The Yankee bats have to work. Look, Jeana Bellezza, one of BYB’s managing editors had a super comprehensive piece yesterday detailing how the Yankees could win this series. One of which was the bats and arms…
Oct. 4, 2017 – Source: Jason Miller/Getty Images North America
“The bullpen is going to be a difference maker here… The reliable Dellin Betances will need to show up and be effective…
The Yankees will need Judge, Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius to set the tone and stay hot at the top of the order like the did against the Twins. The rest of the lineup will need to keep the hits going.”
Sure, it seems so simple, but it’s damn true. They HAVE to hit! They HAVE to pitch well. The Indians really don’t make many mistakes.
Photo: Newsday
And so, it’s Sabathia vs. Kluber at 5pm today.
It’s an intense series already, but wouldn’t it be a hoot if the Yankees could find a way to dominate Kluber, because ultimately, that is the hardest obstacle to climb in Cleveland. The Indians play best behind solid pitching, but if we are able to cut the head off the snake, maybe that puts the Tribe on their heels… and maybe the Yankees confidence will surface.
It is a tough challenge, but the Yankees aren’t here because they were a bad team… they are not! They are solid and they have the tools to pull through. Ultimately though, they need to dig deep and get the job done. This is the playoffs… we’re not playing the Mets here… this is important.
Go Yanks! Do the job! Grind.

Review: L’Arpeggiata Continues to Push Early Music’s Boundaries,"Ms. Scheen and Ms. Bridelli combined beautifully in a duet from “Orfeo,” “Sleep, beautiful eyes.” And they offered another predictable encore, “Pur ti miro,” the transcendent closing duet of Monteverdi’s opera “L’Incoronazione di Poppea.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The concert offered ample evidence of the adventurous artistry and enterprise of L’Arpeggiata, whose artistic director, Christina Pluhar, anchored the performances on the theorbo (a twangy, deep-voiced, long-necked lute). As is their wont, the superbly skilled and imaginative players — most notably the incomparable Doron David Sherwin, on the trumpetlike cornetto — improvised freely and smoothly, whether in momentary embellishments or in bravura solos.
But it was in the second program that they pulled out all the stops. Called “La Festa d’Arpeggiata,” with a justifiable element of self-celebration, it ranged from ancient folk songs (handsomely delivered, mostly by Mr. Capezzuto) to music of Monteverdi, Purcell and other Baroque composers, and from an improvised jam session to “Hallelujah.”
Photo
L’Arpeggiata’s style is to test borders relentlessly, with, say, a modern piano and rhythm section in songs of Purcell. And most forays succeed on some level.
Several numbers were performed here in a more or less straight, historically informed manner. This time, Monteverdi’s “Pur ti miro” was part of the actual program, and Ms. Scheen and Ms. Bridelli put it across meltingly again, in a slightly more restrained performance.
But another “greatest hit” of the Baroque era, “When I am laid in earth” from Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas,” as moving a lament as has ever been written, fared less well. Accompanied in jazzy fashion by piano and drums and partially crooned by Ms. Scheen, it was utterly defanged.
All of this is a matter of taste rather than technique or artistry, and none of it is to denigrate the quality of the performances, which were all of the highest level. But this question of taste has come up before in L’Arpeggiata performances. Perhaps paradoxically, the group’s ventures farthest afield turn out to offer less consistent fun than its serious — which is still to say, wildly inventive — performances of standard Baroque repertory."
Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil Spill And The Corexit Oil Dispersant Health Problems Confirmed,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
Back on April 20, 2010, a major environmental catastrophe occurred in the Gulf of Mexico when the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig exploded and 4.9 million barrels of crude spilled into the Gulf waters creating a problem that was not ‘fixed’ until July 10, 2010 when the rig finally was able to be capped.
One of the approved emergency methods to control the oil spill was the use of Corexit™, a chemical dispersant sprayed from aircraft. According to a report about the health issues related to that chemical “Respiratory, Dermal, and Eye Irritation Symptoms Associated with Corexit™ EC9527A/EC9500A following the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Findings from the GuLF STUDY,” we learn in the Introduction,
As part of the oil spill response and cleanup (OSRC), approximately 1.8 million gallons (6.8 million liters) of oil dispersant was applied both to the sea surface [1.07 million gallons (4.05 million liters)] and directly into the stream of oil leaving the wellhead 5,000 feet (1.5 km) underwater [0.77 million gallons (2.9 million liters)] (United States Coast Guard 2011).
Furthermore, in the Conclusion of that report, association is made that health issues apparently were caused by the dispersant chemical.
Potential exposure to Corexit™ EC9527A or EC9500A was associated with a range of health symptoms at the time of the OSRC, as well as at the time of study enrollment, 1–3 y after the spill. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1677
Table 2 of the report cites the following health issues:
Cough; Wheeze; Tightness in chest; Shortness of breath; Burning in nose, throat, lungs; Burning eyes; Itching eyes; Skin Irritation.
The above report confirms what clean-up crew members were reporting at the time of the incident and thereafter. However, what long-range health problems do they face? Man-made toxic chemicals are known to cause irreparable DNA breaks, which lead to cancers.
The truly IRONIC part about all the above is what a judge ruled regarding lawsuits filed about Corexit exposure and health problems:
Law360, Los Angeles (November 30, 2012, 6:19 PM EST) — A Louisiana federal judge on Tuesday dismissed personal injury lawsuits against chemical maker Nalco over the use of its oil dispersant Corexit after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, ruling that federal authority to clean up oil spills preempted injury claims by workers and residents. In a 36-page decision on Tuesday granting Nalco’s motion for summary judgment, U.S. District Judge Carl J. Barbier of New Orleans, who oversees the multidistrict litigation concerning the oil disaster, ruled that claims for exposure-related injuries were barred by the Clean Water Act and the National Contingency Plan. Source
Perhaps first responders and clean-up crews ought to consider the short- and long-range ramifications and personal injury possibilities they can encounter and be exposed to regarding any type of disasters they are sent in to remediate and even refuse going, especially when legal deprivations like what happened in this case:
But Judge Barbier ruled that if he were to permit the plaintiffs’ claims, “then, during the next substantial spill or ‘spill of national significance,’ the threat of liability might cause the manufacturer of dispersant X to refuse to provide its product, even though the FOSC determined that dispersant X should be used.” Ecolab, a water, hygiene and energy technology business that is the parent company of Nalco, expressed gratification with Tuesday’s decision. Source
Isn’t there something inherently wrong with the legal system in the USA when a judge rules not to permit plaintiffs’ claims to proceed when plaintiffs are damaged cleaning up a disaster?
Shouldn’t the federal government then be responsible legally for making damaged plaintiffs whole?
Doesn’t that Corexit ruling somehow remind us of what Congress did to protect vaccine makers from product liability lawsuits too?
Remember what happened to first responders on 9/11 [1], including deliberate lies [2] told about how safe the air was?
Who is going to take care of first responders’ safety and wellbeing health issues resulting from dangerous and dramatic events like terrorism, chemical spills and whatever man-made disasters may be in our future?

People in Louisiana absolutely love their Saints. They stuck with them through thick and thin (mostly thin) during decades of horrific play and national mockery.
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
This humble author actually lived outside of New Orleans back in the days when fans would wear bags over their heads when they went to games but still, they were loyal to a fault.
There was nothing sweeter for the locals than when the Saints made a breakthrough to respectability and the playoffs under head coach Jim Mora and the woes of Hurricane Katrina and the flooding of much of the Big Easy were somehow relieved with the beloved NFL team won the Super Bowl in 2010.
But Monday was a sad day for many New Orleans Saints fans after they witnessed ten multimillionaire ingrates sitting on their ass during the national anthem to express their hostility to the same system that made them wealthy beyond their wildest dreams.
Thank the NFL and its clown commissioner Roger Goodell for their dismay. The same man who served as judge, jury, and executioner after the infamous “Bountygate” allowed the malcontents to take over the league and under the pretense of social justice, engage in a mass protest against their anger that the U.S. Constitution prohibited black President Barack Obama from running for a third term.
When you boil all of this crap down and strip it of the lies and platitudes of the self-serving charlatans, it all comes down to the racial resentment of men who were fortunate enough to raise themselves above the horrors of the hood to become wealthy football players.
While the national media and all of the NFL’s shills will continue to promote the false narrative, people aren’t stupid and can see through this garbage.
Like the Louisiana lawmaker who has just called for his state’s subsidizing of this team which, along with the NFL, has acted in a reprehensible manner in its disrespect for country and disregard for fans including owner Tom Benson who rewarded years of support for a mediocre team by allowing his players to wipe their asses with the flag inside the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on Sunday.
Louisiana lawmaker: New Orleans Saints should lose state support after player protests https://t.co/TInPFI6cws — NOLA.com (@NOLAnews) September 25, 2017
The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports ”Louisiana lawmaker: New Orleans Saints should lose state support after player protests”:
Offended by New Orleans Saints players who protested by sitting during the national anthem Sunday (Sept. 24), state House Rep. Kenny Havard, R-Jackson, called for Louisiana’s government to pull state funding, tax breaks and other support from the professional football franchise. “Disrespecting our national anthem and flag in the name of social injustice is the highest form of hypocrisy,” Havard said in a written statement Monday. About $165 million of the Saints $1.5 billion value can be attributed to public funding, tax breaks and incentives given to Saints owner Tom Benson each year, according to an analysis The Times-Picayune | NOLA.com conducted in 2016. Benson, Louisiana’s richest resident, owes a good portion of his estimated $2.2 billion fortune to his ownership of two professional sports franchises, the Saints and the New Orleans Pelicans, which are both supported with taxpayer money. “I believe in the right to protest, but not at a taxpayer-subsidized sporting event. Do it on your own time. There are plenty of disabled children, elderly and veterans in this state that would appreciate the money,” Havard said.
Considering that Louisiana is strapped for cash and that Democrats like Big Easy Mayor Mitch Landrieu is more interested in wasting taxpayer money on removing Confederate statues in order to build a national profile it would be hard to argue with Havard.
Not only should local politicians cut off the vampiric NFL from sucking on their necks but a national movement needs to commence to revoke the tax-exempt status of this league of chiselers which has now chosen to ally itself with the Democrat party and the identity group activists that comprise its base.
The blowback is only beginning, if the NFL doubles down and encourages more national anthem protests next week or caves to set aside a month to sponsor anti-police activism then it is only going to result in more states rethinking how to best allocate taxpayer dollars.
It could be an idea that is catching on, a Tennessee lawmaker has also called out the NFL Titans and is pushing his own bill to strip the team of taxpayer subsidies as long as the league continues to allow the flag to be disrespected.

‘Dynasty’ or ‘Dallas’? Squaring Off in the Lily Pond,"JACOBS A fig stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in prosciutto! As played by Pamela Sue Martin (familiar to me from a terrifying afternoon watching “The Poseidon Adventure”), Fallon was my favorite character on the show: intelligent, free-spirited and sexually liberated.
Yes, she was a spoiled brat with an Elektra complex, but also a feminist who wasn’t about to let any man tell her how to live her life, a working mother who single-handedly turns around Blake’s hotel, La Mirage. The chemistry between her and the staid, dependable Jeff Colby (John James) was intoxicating to my preadolescent self.
HEALY Fallon the working mother … hmmm … there are working mothers and then there are Carrington working mothers. And I’m not sure “feminist” is the first word I’d use for someone who was so demeaning and spiteful (at least at first) to other women.
For me, Fallon represented a central flaw of “Dynasty.” The show was a portrait of wealth, glamour, conspicuous consumption and narcissism — nothing more, really. Everyone wanted Blake’s love and money, and to a lesser extent Cecil Colby’s. The sexual politics became increasingly problematic, too: While the men schemed and sabotaged, the women fought over men in lily ponds and apartments.
“Dallas” felt richer for its focus on family and betrayal. (It was not above a pool fight, but those usually involved men.)
Both shows did have great villains. How would you rate J. R. and Joan Collins’s Alexis?
JACOBS No contest. J. R. felt irritatingly underplayed, with a rushed mumbling delivery. His predilection for the insults “slut,” “loser,” “drunk” and “saddle tramp” got old fast.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
HEALY Alexis called Krystle “you bitch!” a fair amount too. Those lines were juvenile, but I was juvenile, and they made me laugh.
JACOBS And she managed to make “whore” a two-syllable word! Alexis was over the top but she was both always herself and constantly changing — and not just outfits. She rolled with whatever crazy story line the writers came up with (quite literally, in the case of the infamous mud-wrestling scene). And she always committed 100 percent, whether it was to singing a rendition of Frank Loesser’s “The Boys in the Back Room” à la Marlene Dietrich or falling off a balcony with Dex in the last season’s final episode.
Which brings us to cliffhangers. Sashaying down memory lane with you made me realize how much the experience of watching television has changed, from once-a-week treat to isolated bingeing-and-tweeting. Who the heck shot J. R., anyway?
HEALY J. R. took it in the chest from his mistress Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby), Sue Ellen’s scheming sister. That guy was such a dirty dog, but he was also one of the first prime-time villains that viewers loved to hate. He was a forerunner to antiheroes like Tony Soprano, Walter White and Cersei Lannister.
The “Who Shot J. R.?” season finale of “Dallas” was, for me, the greatest TV cliffhanger of all time. It came in March 1980; it wasn’t until November that Kristin was unmasked as the shooter. During the intervening months, everyone from President Carter to Vegas oddsmakers weighed in on J. R. The watercooler energy was enormous. While other television shows had fan followings, “Dallas” demonstrated that you could keep viewers in thrall for much of a year without any new episodes.
“Dynasty” had its own cliffhangers. I’ll bet you a Dean & DeLuca coffee that we agree on the most memorable one.
JACOBS Well, it has deeply uncomfortable resonance right now, but the Moldavian Massacre was the most memorable to me. That was truly scary: terrorists, shattering glass, bloodied bodies. Better make it a martini.
HEALY Gruesome images — and then, cue the credits.
JACOBS It took place during a royal wedding, with the bride, Amanda Carrington, played by real-life royalty, Catherine Oxenberg. Somehow the “Dy” in “Dynasty” was all bound up in my head with Princess Diana, and her own royal wedding to Prince Charles (never mind that the English pronounced it “Din-asty”). Obviously this was a time of conservatism and convention and backlash to the progressivism of the ’60s and ’70s.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
HEALY The depiction of so many women on “Dallas” as sexual objects and playthings definitely ran counter to progressivism. But “Dynasty” and “Dallas” could be topical, too.
JACOBS “Dynasty” moved the national conversation forward on homosexuality. Steven Carrington is immediately introduced as being attracted to men, and despite tentativeness in how the show presented his orientation, one felt the creators were basically on his side — don’t you think? He was a likable and complex character, not a caricature.
Then, of course, Rock Hudson’s death shortly after appearing on the show provoked national hysteria that he might have infected Linda Evans with H.I.V. by kissing her, which led to important education about how the disease is actually transmitted.
It was dismissed for being superficial but was actually right on top of the issues! And it had a few African-American cast members, notably the great Diahann Carroll as the mega-glam Dominique Deveraux. Did “Dallas” have a single minority?
HEALY “Dallas” was an extraordinarily white show. For a state as racially and ethnically diverse as Texas, the series really failed by reducing people of color to servants and waitresses.
It did strive for some social relevancy, though, with its portrait of alcoholism. Sue Ellen struggled for years to get sober and stay sober: J. R. made serenity impossible, but it was really Sue Ellen’s battle with low self-esteem, betrayal, envy and self-loathing that proved painful to watch through her relapses — but ultimately pretty inspiring as she achieved stretches of sobriety.
With the stabs at realism came the fantastical. I speak, of course, about the Mortal Sin of “Dallas” — the entire season of episodes that was retroactively labeled a “dream” of Pam’s to explain Bobby’s death and subsequent reappearance in her shower. What was the best twist of “Dynasty”?
JACOBS I don’t recall anything as shocking as the gasp-inducing “scar” reveal by Marcia Cross on “Melrose Place,” but the return of regular-guy Matthew Blaisdel at the end of Season 7 was certainly unexpected. It was no surprise whatsoever to me, though, at that point, that he had elected to hold the Carrington family hostage.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
And speaking of “Melrose,” that brings us to the current reboot, which stars Grant Show as Blake. How do you think it will stack up against the “Dallas” one a few years ago?
HEALY Watching the new “Dynasty,” I missed the old “Dynasty.” The new versions of both “Dynasty” and “Dallas” go young with their actors. But the “Dallas” reboot still had J. R., Sue Ellen and Bobby, and they were up to their old tricks and in fine form. If only Joan Collins wasreprising her role as Alexis in the “Dynasty” reboot, as a cougar to middle-aged Blake!
JACOBS You keep dreaming, honey … just like Pam Ewing. And now I’ll flounce away, borrowing a line from the original Krystle:
“If you want a rematch, just whistle … if you can!”"

Radical left zealots have succeeded in bullying a Massachusetts Dr. Seuss museum to remove a ‘racist’ mural? What’s next, burning the books inside too? Now that the cultural cleansers on the fanatical left have established the idea that even Dr. Seuss was a racist, the war on statues is shifting to one of the most beloved figures in the history of childhood literature. Theodor Seuss Geisel’s entertaining books filled with weird characters proved to be an invaluable resource to teachers who were tasked with teaching generations of young Americans to read. Seuss’s wild and whacky world instilled a desire in children to learn and his contribution to society has been a very positive one. But now according to the zealots on the left who won’t be happy until they have used their cudgel of “racism” to eradicate every historical figure, reinterpret every major event and most of all, burn the culture of the oppressive white society that that has kept them in shackles to the ground and then dance on the ashes. Thanks to relentless liberal pressure, a Massachusetts museum that is dedicated to the work of Dr. Seuss has been bullied into the removal of a piece of artwork …

Solar cars begin race across Australian desert,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The World Solar Challenge began on Sunday with 42 solar cars crossing Australia’s tropical north to its southern shores, a grueling 3,000 km (1,864 mile) race through the outback.
The race from the northern city of Darwin to the southern city of Adelaide is expected to take a week for most cars, with speeds of 90-100 kmh (55-62 mph) powered only by the sun.
The fastest time was achieved by Japan’s Tokai University in 2009, completing the transcontinetal race in only 29 hours and 49 minutes.
Belgian team Punch Powertrain started first on Sunday after recording a trial time of 2:03.8 for 2.97 km (1.78 miles), hitting an average speed of 83.4 kmh (51.5mph).
But reigning 2015 champions Nuon from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands believes it has a good chance of retaining the prize.
“All the cars look completely different (this year), and all we know is we’ve got a good car, we’ve got it running perfectly the last couple of days and we’re confident we’re going to do everything to win,” tour manager Sarah Benninkbolt said Sunday.

Race director Chris Selwood said the biennial event has attracted one of the best fields ever, with teams from more than 40 countries.
“This is the 30th anniversary of the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge and competitors want to be part of that. They have been drawn to the challenge of new regulations which reduced the solar array size without limiting the size of the solar car,” Selwood said.

Teams come from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, Chile, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Belgium, Sweden, Iran, South Korea, India, Hong Kong, South Africa, Poland, Thailand, Turkey, Canada, Taiwan and Australia.
The Northern Territory Minister for Tourism and Culture, Lauren Moss said her government’s A$250,000 (US$194,150) sponsorship of the race showed it was committed to achieving 50 percent renewable energy for the territory by 2030.
“Innovation is at the heart of the event and the technology showcased this year will influence continuing solar innovation for vehicles and householders in the future,” she said.
“This event is a great promotion for the NT – it shows our ability to innovate to the world.”"

Grupo Mexico in 2016 scrapped plans for the IPO of 15 percent of ITM‘S stock, arguing that market conditions were not optimal. At that time, it had hoped to raise between 13.7 billion pesos and 16.0 billion pesos ($750 million to $876 million).
Grupo Mexico struck a $2.1 billion deal in March to take over Florida East Coast Railway, allowing it to expand its exposure to U.S. rail freight, increase dollar earnings and diversify revenue sources."

Cam Newton Says It's 'Funny' Hearing Female Reporter 'Talk About Routes',"Maddie Meyer/Getty Images
Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to make a sexist comment during Wednesday's press conference.
Newton chuckled and said it was funny to hear Jourdan Rodrigue, a female reporter for the Charlotte Observer, ask him about passing routes. Bridget Condon of ABC 11 in Durham, North Carolina, shared a clip of Newton's reaction to the question:
GQ's Jay Willis provided the transcript of Rodrigue's question:
NFL Network's Ian Rapoport shared a statement from Panthers spokesman Steven Drummond: ""I have spoken with Jourdan and Cam and I know they had a conversation where he expressed regret for using those words. We strive as a department to make the environment for media comfortable for everyone covering the team.""
Scott Fowler of the Charlotte Observer passed along details of the second encounter:
""She asked the quarterback if he really didn't think a female could understand routes.
""Newton said she wasn't really seeing specific routes when watching the game, she was just seeing if somebody was open. She argued that he didn't know what she saw nor how hard she had studied football, and that maybe the two of them needed to have a deeper conversation.
""Newton said that maybe he should have said it was funny to hear 'reporters' talk about routes and that, if she actually did know about them, then she knew more than most reporters. Then he gestured toward the locker room, still filled with her colleagues.""
Rapoport also shared a statement from Rodrigue:
Rodrigue responded to Newton's comments on Twitter:
The Association of Women in Sports Media also released a statement condemning Newton's remarks:
The Pro Football Writers Association released a statement on the comments as well:
USA Today's Lindsay Jones underscored why Newton was so far off the mark:
While the NFL is a male-dominated league in terms of those who run teams and work on coaching staffs, that couldn't be further from the truth in terms of NFL fans, with women making up 45 percent of those who watch the game.
The idea that a woman, especially an NFL beat writer, doesn't understand the nuances of the game should be a relic of the past."
Mother Accused Of Killing Newborn And Living With The Dead Baby’s Body For 3 Months,"A New York woman is facing serious charges for not only reportedly killing her newborn infant, but for keeping the child’s body in her home with her and her two other kids for several months.
 
Police have charge Christina Colantonio of Batavia, New York with second-degree murder for allegedly killing her infant daughter and living with the body for approximately 3 months, according to Genesee County Dist. Atty. Lawrence Friedman.
 
Though prosecutors would not disclose the cause of death, authorities have told the NY Daily News that they “have enough evidence to come to a conclusion it was intentionally caused.”
 
Accused of killing the baby “shortly after birth,” WCVB reports an acquaintance who visited the 28-year-old’s home saw the body and contacted police. At a news conference, police Sgt. Todd Crossett claimed responding officers who found the baby girls remains were offered counseling.
 
 “It’s not something you see on a regular basis,” Crossett said. “They are the most vulnerable part of the population.”
 
Though Colantonio Has been arrested, a medical examiner will determine an official cause of death. Genesee County Dist. Atty. Lawrence Friedman disclosed that the investigation is still ongoing.

Kaepernick: When Taking a Knee Is All About Me,"Kaepernick: When Taking a Knee Is All About Me
(Before It's News)
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
By Michael R Shannon -
Just think — if Tim Tebow had taken a knee for Antifa instead of God he might still be in the NFL. Or at least he could be a topic of conversation for people wondering why Tebow wasn’t playing. I find it ironic a league that is now encouraging “celebrations” after a touchdown, frowned on Tebow offering a quick word of thanks after a score. Offering a word of thanks certainly isn’t a problem with Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick loses his starting QB job and decides to make himself a spectacle by kneeling during the National Anthem to protest racism in a league that’s 70 percent black. Tebow loses his starting QB job and quietly accepts an insulting assignment as a blocker on the punting unit, where he suffers broken ribs as a reward for being a team player. Kaepernick says he can’t “stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color” and “there are bodies in the street and [cops] getting away with murder.” How this squares with the fact he was adopted by white parents and felt comfortable wearing socks that depicted police as pigs while cops were standing …

Analysts raise EU carbon price forecasts on expectations of market reform: survey,"LONDON (Reuters) - Analysts have raised their forecasts for European carbon prices in the bloc’s Emission Trading System (ETS) to 2019 on expectations that plans to reform the market will significantly curb oversupply.
Analysts expect EU Allowances (EUAs) to average 7.16 euros/ton in 2018, and 9.92 euros/ton in 2019, according to the survey of seven analysts by Reuters published on Wednesday.
The forecasts were up 19 percent and 16 percent, respectively, on prices given in July, of 6.01 euros for 2018 and 8.54 euros for 2019.
Analysts also for the first time gave average price forecasts for 2020, which at 14.70 euros are almost double current traded prices around 7.40 euros/ton.
The European Union’s ETS, a cap-and-trade permit system to regulate industry pollution, has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis.
As part of the process to fix the scheme European lawmakers are working on reforms, and plan to double the rate at which the so-called Market Stability Reserve (MSR) -- a measure designed to remove from the market surplus permits which have depressed prices -- soaks up excess allowances.
“The MSR will considerably reduce auction supply in 2019 and this should have a strong bullish effect on market prices, putting more pressure on utilities to find EUAs for compliance,” said Sandrine Ferrand, analyst at Engie Global Markets.
In the shorter term analysts lifted their average price forecasts for Q4 2017 by 26 percent to 6.82 euros/ton on expectations that prolonged outages to French nuclear plants could lift EUA demand from fossil-fuel power generators in neighboring countries which usually import power from France.
After several delays in the restart of some of France’s nuclear reactors following maintenance and a review ordered by the nuclear watchdog, 21 out of France’s 58 nuclear reactors are offline.
“The French nuclear fleet is a joker (in the pack), as it is uncertain whether the security probes will extend the planned outages, thus providing further support to power and carbon,” said Haege Fjellheim, head of carbon market analysis at Thomson Reuters."
British jihadi 'White Widow' killed by U.S. drone: Sun report,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sally Jones, a British jihadi who recruited online for the Islamic State group, has been killed in Syria by a U.S. drone along with her 12-year-old son, The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday.
A convert to Islam from southern England, Jones was nicknamed the “White Widow” by the British press after her jihadi husband Junaid Hussain, also an IS militant, was killed by a drone in 2015.
Quoting a British intelligence source who had been briefed by U.S. counterparts, The Sun reported that Jones and her son had been killed in June close to Syria’s border with Iraq, as she was attempting to flee the IS stronghold of Raqqa.
U.S. intelligence chiefs were quoted as saying they could not be 100 percent certain that Jones had been killed as there was no way of recovering any DNA from the ground, but they were “confident” she was dead.
Related Coverage Britain declines to comment on reported death of 'white widow' jihadist
Her son JoJo was presumed to be dead too, although his presence with her was not known at the time of the drone strike and he was not an intended target, according to The Sun.
British Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman declined to comment directly on the report, as did Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.
“If you are a British national in Iraq or Syria, and if you have chosen to fight for Daesh, an illegal organization that is preparing and inspiring terror attacks on our streets, then you’ve made yourself a legitimate target,” Fallon told reporters in London.
“And you run the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile,” he said.
One Western security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Jones had not been heard of since earlier this year so the assumption was that she was dead, although the source refused to confirm the details of the Sun report.
Other IS militants have been reported dead only to reappear.
A Central Intelligence Agency spokeswoman declined to comment.
Jones, who before her jihadi days was once a singer in a punk band, has been the subject of years of fascination by the British press.
She was believed to have left her home in Chatham, in the southern county of Kent, in 2013 to travel to Syria, where she married Hussain whom she had met online.
She was active as an online recruiter and sometimes posted propaganda messages on social media, including a striking photograph of herself dressed as a nun pointing a gun toward the camera."
"Media, Mayors, and Celebs Lying About Trump and Puerto Rico","Media, Mayors, and Celebs Lying About Trump and Puerto Rico
(Before It's News)
For more great articles like this visit http://www.fixthisnation.com
The media was only too pleased to tell us the story of the mean, racist President Donald Trump going to war with the poor, determined feminist mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico this weekend. According to Joe Scarborough, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Lady Gaga, and all the rest of the elite, this is just another example of Trump’s white supremacist colors showing. Look how eagerly he helped out in Florida and Texas, they said. Look how well he handled those hurricanes. Now compare it to the way he’s handling Puerto Rico. It’s because they’re Hispanic! It’s because they don’t represent his voters. It’s because he’s a racist who doesn’t care about brown people! Ahhh, the humanity!
It’s complete and total fake news.
The Washington Examiner this week reported that a nearby mayor, Angel Perez Otero of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, has had nothing but praise for the Trump administration’s response the Hurricane Maria. And he accused fellow Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz of “playing politics” with the developing story.
“I’ve seen other mayors participating,” said Perez Otero. “She’s not.”
He said that, unlike Cruz, he was in constant contact with federal government agencies, who were doing their best to coordinate relief efforts. “We are receiving a lot of help from FEMA and the Red Cross…there is lots of help coming to us,” he said. “They won’t leave until Puerto Rico is good.”
Cruz’s fellow mayor is not the only one accusing her of being unresponsive to federal recovery agencies. In an interview with CNN, FEMA administrator Brock Long – being far more diplomatic than Trump – made the same point. “The problem we have with her, unfortunately, is that unity of command is ultimately what’s needed to be successful in this response,” he said. “What we need is for the mayor to make her way to the joint field office and get plugged into what’s going on and be successful.”
The aid is there. The troops are on the ground. The food, medicine, and supplies are getting to Puerto Rico as quickly as possible. But if those supplies simply sit there on the loading docks, they aren’t doing anyone any good. And that’s where Trump is right when he says that people like Cruz “expect everything to be done for them.” He’s not saying: “Hey, it’s your hurricane, deal with it yourself,” like the media is trying to portray. He’s literally saying that they’re doing NOTHING to help. And if you don’t believe that coming from Trump or conservative media, maybe you’ll believe the Huffington Post.
In an interview with Colonel Michael Valle, the Director of the Joint Air Component Coordination Element, Air Force – a Puerto Rico native himself – HuffPo found that the prevailing narrative about the Trump administration thumbing its nose at the territory was a false one:
“It’s just not true,” Col. Valle says of the major disconnect today between the perception of a lack of response from Washington versus what is really going on on the ground. “I have family here. My parents’ home is here. My uncles, aunts, cousins, are all here. As a Puerto Rican, I can tell you that the problem has nothing to do with the U.S. military, FEMA, or the DoD. “The aid is getting to Puerto Rico. The problem is distribution. The federal government has sent us a lot of help; moving those supplies, in particular, fuel, is the issue right now,” says Col. Valle. Until power can be restored, generators are critical for hospitals and shelter facilities and more. But, and it’s a big but, they can’t get the fuel to run the generators.
There’s another problem, Valle told HuffPo. Hardly anyone is showing up to work. There are no drivers. The supplies are there and the trucks are there, but “only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work.”
Valle was quick to say that the drivers shouldn’t be blamed – they have families to take care of – but it just shows that there is more to this situation than the media is letting on. Trump has done – IS DOING – what he can. But he’s right – it has to be a joint effort. And right now, it isn’t. Not the way it needs to be. And the last thing that’s helpful is to have the mayor of San Juan using this as an opportunity to become part of the “resistance.”

Trump Warns Puerto Rico Weeks After Storms: Federal Help Cannot Stay ‘Forever’,"“Tweet away your hate to mask your administration’s mishandling of this humanitarian crisis,” she said, addressing the president. “While you are amusing yourself throwing paper towels at us, your compatriots and the world are sending love and help our way. Condemn us to a slow death of nondrinkable water, lack of food, lack of medicine while you keep others eager to help from reaching us.”
Gov. Ricardo Rosselló was more restrained as he has been through previous rounds of criticism by Mr. Trump. After the tweets on Thursday morning, he called the White House and said he received assurances that the president fully supported recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.
“I reiterate my plea that, as U.S. citizens, we are not asking for better treatment or less treatment,” Mr. Rosselló said. “We are asking for equal treatment. We’re not asking for anything that another U.S. jurisdiction, having passed through the same situation, wouldn’t be asking at this juncture.”
Puerto Rico was already facing deep financial troubles before Hurricanes Irma and Maria swept across the island, knocking out many basic services. Three weeks after Maria hit, 83 percent of the island was still without power, 36 percent had no running water and 45 percent was without telecommunication services.
While some sort of normalcy has been restored in San Juan, residents of the more isolated interior municipalities were still struggling with a precarious health situation and problems with aid distribution. Although 86 percent of supermarkets are now open, the government could not ensure that they were fully stocked with food and water.
Despite Mr. Trump’s tweets, administration officials said the federal government would be helping Puerto Rico recover from storm damage for years. The Federal Emergency Management Agency posted its own message on Twitter: “.@FEMA will be w/Puerto Rico, USVI, every state, territory impacted by a disaster every day, supporting throughout their response & recovery.”
Other agencies were committed to long-term efforts as well. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, for example, is helping rebuild the electrical grid badly damaged by the storm, a construction effort that could take years. In addition, other agencies helping in recovery efforts, like the Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection, have a permanent presence on the island and are unlikely to go anywhere.

As for Mr. Trump’s assertion that he could not keep “first responders” on the island forever, one official called it nonsense. Such responders include police officers, firefighters and paramedics from localities around the United States who are not under the control of the president.
While search and rescue operations and storm-related deaths are becoming less common, the situation on much of the island remained precarious. Hospitals are operating on generator power, which is expensive and unreliable. And major roadways have been cleared of debris, opening access to cities, but many Puerto Ricans are still relying on FEMA to provide food and water, which are being delivered to neighborhoods by local governments.
Even those who have gone back to work are expending an unsustainable level of resources to function. Without running water or electricity in their homes, those who can afford it are relying on generators, which are expensive to fuel, to light their homes and keep food cold, buying batteries to power fans and drinking bottled water exclusively.

On a helicopter trip Thursday morning to Cidra, a small city an hour south of San Juan, the devastated landscape was speckled with homes that were still without roofs, and were covered with tarps. Almost every street was lined with huge piles of tree branches and other debris beginning to rot and stink.
Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who is leading the United States military effort in Puerto Rico, said that conditions were only somewhat improved since he arrived two weeks ago. “It’s still complete devastation across the island,” he said. “It’s going to take a long time to fix.”
Responding to Mr. Trump’s tweets this morning that the military could not stay in Puerto Rico forever, he said, “That’s true. We don’t do recovery, we do emergency response.”

“Right now we’re still in the emergency response, so it is necessary,” he said.
He said that he had not experienced pressure from military leadership to start pulling troops off the island. “Not at all, none whatsoever,” he said. “I’ve gotten everything I’ve asked for.”
Mr. Trump has alternately praised the federal response and expressed frustration that so much has been required. Unlike after hurricanes struck Texas and Florida, he has complained that Puerto Rico was ruining the federal budget.
Puerto Rico, which was struggling with a debt crisis before the storms hit, may run out of money by the end of the month, and Mr. Trump asked Congress on Tuesday for a $4.9 billion loan to help pay its most pressing obligations amid warnings that it would not be able to pay teachers and health care providers. That comes after Mr. Trump already requested $29 billion for storm recovery efforts.

The House planned to take up disaster aid on Thursday, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan was set to travel on Friday to Puerto Rico with a bipartisan delegation for a firsthand assessment of the damage. “We need to stand with the people of Puerto Rico as they work to rebuild their communities,” Mr. Ryan told reporters.
The president’s expression of impatience with the length of the recovery effort after just three weeks stood in contrast to the federal investment after prior storms. A former official in the George W. Bush administration noted that the federal government kept at least some military in New Orleans for nearly a year after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 and that the government took more than five years for recovery efforts over all.
“It’s fairly typical for FEMA, D.H.S. and other executive agencies to be on the ground running recovery operations for years to come,” said James Norton, the former official, who worked at the Department of Homeland Security under Mr. Bush. “I would expect them to be operating in Texas and Florida for the next couple of years.”
Puerto Rico’s financial crisis has been decades in the making, resulting in $74 billion in public debt. Earlier this year, the government of Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy-like protection in federal court to stave off creditors, including mutual funds and hedge funds. The island got into its current mess after bad fiscal management in which it issued bonds to finance day-to-day operations when tax receipts could not cover the costs.
The situation got worse after Congress, about a decade ago, decided to phase out some of the tax exemptions that had made Puerto Rico a favorable location for some pharmaceutical companies and other businesses to set up shop. The move prompted some business to leave the island, resulting in lower tax revenues and many residents moving to the mainland United States for jobs.
Puerto Rico’s economy has been in a recession for about a decade and the poverty rate on the island is about 45 percent. The devastation caused by Maria will make it even more difficult for the economy to recover as some are estimating hundreds of thousands more residents can leave Puerto Rico if electricity is not restored soon.
And while many of the luxury resorts in the San Juan area are expected to be fully operational by year’s end, there is growing concern about whether tourists will flock to the island at a time when so many are living in desperate straights. Tourism supports about 65,000 jobs in Puerto Rico.
Mr. Trump’s tweets left his advisers in the awkward position of trying to explain what he meant or distancing themselves from his apparent meaning. At a House hearing on Thursday, Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, seemed deeply uncomfortable under questioning from Representative Maxine Waters of California, a Democrat who pressed him on whether he agreed with the president.
“So you don’t agree that it should be abandoned, is that right?” she asked.
“Of course it should not be abandoned,” he replied.

“Should they be shamed for its own plight?” she asked.
“I don’t think it is beneficial to go around shaming people in general,” he said."

The vast majority tend to put excessively consideration on the substance of the discussion when the association matters the most. Your everyday talks are intended to enable you to get to know one another, so it isn’t so much that critical what you discuss, as long as you folks talk.
As nowadays we have seen that a lot of people who are engaged in long distance relationship and some are far from their dear ones like family, wife and all. But there is no need to be a worry as it’s easy to maintain your love bonding strong for all of you. No matter how far away you are a simple message can feel you reunite and closer to each other.
Also, Facetime Game has a great time all the while, rest of this in this article I’m highlighting the most playing games. Here is to have a lively outlook.
21 Questions:
Simple this is all time favorite game. Particularly for those who are nerdy and book lover yet this is an impressive play where the alternate or your opponent asking each other a fascinating individual question. Plus, this game initially starts in one discussion and proceeded in the following and the following until the point when you get to 21 questions asked all together. To cheat a tad bit, you can set up a couple of your inquiries or questions in advance.
Two Truths and One Lie:
After this, on the other hand, the next is two truths and one lie. In this, you should simply to alternate revealing to each other two certainties about your life/or that day and one lie. Also, from the three certainties, your accomplice needs to figure which one is the lie and why. So this is also a good way to spend a quality time with your partner during FaceTime.
Last Letter:
It is simple and however super fun where one of you begins by saying one arbitrary word, and afterward, alternate needs to state another word that starts with the last letter of this past word, et cetera until the point that you can’t discover a work that begins with that letter & wasn’t said sometime recently. So words can’t be rehashed. When one of you stalls out, they lose. This game has four rounds, and each time you lose you get a letter from “KILL,” on the other hand if you lose four times you’d be gathering every one of the letters & hence get killed and lose the entire play.
The Exhaustion Game:
In this game, you have to pick a classification like vegetables, natural products, furniture, creatures and so on and you alternate saying one case from that classification until the point when you debilitate the theme.
True or False?
Lastly, this is a game where you reveal to each other a story or reality from your life/your general learning, and figure whether it’s actual or false. This is an extraordinary thrill and can transform into a fascinating discussion."

Indian court bans firecracker sales in Delhi ahead of peak pollution season,"FILE PHOTO: A worker removes paper rolls after filling them with gunpowder mixture to make firecrackers at a factory on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Amit Dave/File photo
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s top court on Monday temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers in and around the capital ahead of Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, as it looks to prevent a repeat of severe air pollution that forced school closures last year.
New Delhi's air quality has hit ""very unhealthy"" levels, U.S. Embassy data shows. This is often blamed on burning of unwanted vegetation on farms in neighboring states, usual at this time of year, worsened by fumes from fireworks. (bit.ly/2eZOb9H)
The ban takes effect immediately and will run until Nov. 1, said a panel of Supreme Court judges headed by Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri, adding its impact on the region’s air quality would have to be examined after the festival.
“All temporary licenses to sell firecrackers stand canceled,” said Haripriya Padmanabhan, a lawyer representing the group that sought the ban.
“People who had already purchased crackers will be able to burst them. Hopefully they won’t do that,” she told Asian News International, a partner of Reuters Television.
Diwali, traditionally ushered in with the setting off of firecrackers mainly by India’s majority Hindu community, falls on Oct. 19 this year.
The government welcomed the move, with Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan requesting people to abide by the order.

But others, including Priti Gandhi, a leader from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party, saw it as an attack on tradition and Hindu culture.
“We Indians will protest and burn crackers,” wrote one Twitter user, Ishkaran Bhandari. “We will uphold our culture, traditions and celebrate Diwali.”
Last November, about a million children were forced to stay home from school, thousands of workers reported sick and queues formed outside shops selling face masks as New Delhi struggled with its worst pollution for nearly 20 years.
Vehicle emissions and dust from construction sites were the factors blamed for that spike, besides firecrackers and farm burnings.
India and China together account for more than half of the 4.2 million deaths attributable to air pollution worldwide in 2015, a study by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute (HEI) showed.
Global environmental group Greenpeace said the court ban on crackers was only a small relief for the “episodic air pollution levels in October”.
“The pollution levels in north India are multiple times higher than the national standards throughout the winter months, hence we also need to look at a stricter, comprehensive and time-bound action plan to address all sources of air pollution across India,” a Greenpeace India spokeswoman said."

Hawaii approves telescope on volcano sacred to indigenous people,"An artist's concept illustrating the TMT Observatory at the proposed site on Mauna Kea, Hawaii provided September 28, 2017. Courtesy of TMT Observatory/Handout via REUTERS
(Reuters) - A team of scientists won approval from Hawaii officials on Thursday to build a $1.4 billion telescope atop a volcano indigenous people consider sacred, but opponents vowed to continue fighting.
The Hawaii Board of Land and Natural Resources voted 5-2 to allow construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) on the summit of Mauna Kea on Hawaii’s Big Island, state officials said in a statement.
Astronomers consider the summit one of the world’s best places to view the cosmos, while Native Hawaiians say the project would disturb holy ground crucial to their connection with ancestors and the heavens.
A consortium of scientists, after selecting the site in 2009 and applying to build there, initially received construction permits from state officials in 2011. In 2015, the Hawaii Supreme Court voided that decision, saying officials did not follow the proper procedures for a “contested case hearing.”
That forced the state board to re-evaluate the proposal with more input from opponents. The project calls for building one of the world’s largest telescopes atop the dormant volcano.
“This was one of the most difficult decisions this board has ever made,” Suzanne Case, chairwoman of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, said in a statement.
The 13,800 foot-tall (4,205 meters) volcano is already dotted with telescopes, the board noted in a 345-page decision paper.

“Today, Mauna Kea is the best place on earth to study the heavens,” the board’s decision paper said.
Native Hawaiians and environmentalists will soon stage protests at the site and another legal challenge is expected in the Hawaii Supreme Court, said Kahookahi Kanuha, who is co-founder of the Hawaii Unity and Liberation Institute and is Native Hawaiian.

Ilima Long, 40, a graduate student in political science at the University of Hawaii who opposes the project, said Native Hawaiians like herself support science, just not this project.
“Hawaiians, our ancestors were scientists,” she said. “We’re the best navigators and wayfarers of all human history.”
The board placed dozens of conditions on the consortium, which includes scientists from the California Institute of Technology and Japan, India and Canada.
The consortium will be required to provide $1 million a year for college scholarships for Native Hawaiians and other educational initiatives.
“In moving forward, we will listen respectfully to the community in order to realize the shared vision of (Mauna Kea) as a world center for Hawaiian culture, education, and science,” TMT International Observatory Board Chairman Henry Yang said in a statement.

The Bucs got a single and GIDP off Edwin Jackson in the first while the Nats got a double, walk, single and wild pitch but only a run off Ivan Nova. The second went quietly with the Nats leaving a couple more runners on. Mad Max walked with an out in the third and Ivan got clunked in the hand trying to bunt. Steven Brault finished the at bat and then Chris Bostick and Starling went to work. Bo doubled in Max and Marte chased Bo home. Then Tyler Glasnow took the hill. He gave up a couple walks, one after being up 0-2, and a rap to tie the game. The Bucs spun their wheels. Glasnow tossed a quiet fourth, gave up a couple of hits but no runs in the fifth and was pulled after three walks in the sixth to set up a Victor Robles v Edgar Santana two-out, bases-filled duel. Santana won, getting a swinging K.

"France's CGT calls another strike against labor reform, others refuse","PARIS (Reuters) - France’s hard-left CGT trade union called a third strike against President Emmanuel Macron’s overhaul of employment laws on Monday but failed to get other unions to rally behind it.
The three main unions have been divided over how to respond to the labor law reforms, with the Communist Party-rooted CGT taking to the streets while the more moderate CFDT, now France’s biggest union, and the Force Ouvriere preferring negotiations.
France was once a champion of social protest, with unions able to paralyze swathes of the economy and force ministers to back down on reforms. But hardline unions are now grappling for relevance as strikes become less frequent and less disruptive.
Macron’s government’s spent weeks negotiating with the unions during the summer over measures to give companies more power to set working conditions as well as making it easier to hire and fire workers. Last month, it signed the bill into law by decree.
“We are continuing with the fight against the labor law decrees,” Fabrice Angei, a senior CGT unionist, told reporters after a two-hour long meeting with the CFDT, FO and other unions.
The CGT hopes it can win concessions for as long as the decrees are not physically written into the labor code. Up to now, the CFDT has said it will focus on other battles ahead such as reform of the pension and unemployment insurance systems.
Monday’s meeting over labor reform action came on the eve of a separate nationwide strike by public sector workers. Strike notices have been lodged in schools, hospitals, airports and government ministries over plans to axe 120,000 jobs, freeze pay and reduce sick leave compensation.
It is the first time in a decade that all nine unions representing 5.4 million public workers have united behind a protest call and will be an important test of public appetite to protest against the reforms.
If turnout is low on Tuesday, Macron could feel emboldened as he presses ahead with revamping France’s generous unemployment insurance in a bid to spur those who lose their jobs to get back to work more quickly."

Electric honeycomb: Pakistani teen in scientific first,"Only 17 years old and he is already a recognised scientist. Muhammad Shaheer Niazi's research on electric honeycomb was recently published in the Royal Society Open Science journal.
Physicists have known the phenomenon of electric honeycomb for decades. It occurs when a layer of oil is placed in an electric field between a pointy electrode and a flat one - and the instability caused by the build-up of ions applies pressure to the surface of the oil - creating a beautiful pattern that looks like a honeycomb, or a stained glass window.
The high school student from Pakistan's city of Lahore managed to photograph the movement of ions that forms the honeycomb besides recording the heat found on the surface of oil. No one has done this before.
Electric honeycomb phenomenon was the problem given to him at the International Young Physicists' Tournament held in Russia last year. Mr Niazi, and four other students, made up the first-ever team to represent Pakistan at the tournament. Returning from Russia, Mr Niazi decided to get his research published.
It took him another year of work to come up with ""novel ideas"" before his paper was finally accepted for publication. He received the letter of acceptance just days ahead of his 17th birthday last month.
""Your research is like your child, and you feel out of this world when it is accepted for publication,"" Mr Niazi tells the BBC in an interview at his residence in Lahore's posh Sukh Chayn sector.
With the slim stature of a teenage boy with curly hair and spectacles sitting firmly on his nose, the young scientist cuts a smart figure.
'Seeking equilibrium'
Anticipating the first question, he settles down on a couch next to a desk laden with boxes full of wires, motherboards and incomplete circuits. This is where he conducts his experiments.
How is an electric honeycomb formed? Mr Niazi elaborates: ""Electric honeycomb perfectly demonstrates how everything in this universe is seeking equilibrium. Its hexagonal shape is the most stable structure.""
In this case, he says, two electrodes are used; a pointy needle on top of a flat surface with a thin layer of oil on it. High voltage from the needle makes ions bombard the surface of the oil, on their way to meet the ground electrode.
""It is just like lightning striking the surface of earth,"" he says. But oil is a non-conductor. The ions start accumulating on the surface of the oil. As the pressure increases, they create a depression and manage to meet the ground electrode.
In the process the surface of the oil loses its shape, something it does not want. So within no time, honeycomb-like hexagonal structures appear on the surface of the oil.
""The amount of energy that goes in equals the energy that comes out and thus the flow of electricity is efficient. This way equilibrium is restored,"" he sums up. Mr Niazi replicated the phenomenon at last year's tournament.
To prove his findings, he photographed the ion wind demonstrating that the ions were moving. He also recorded the heat produced through their movement, a finding that needs further study.
He says he had been using the shadowgraphy technique just for fun before he decided to use it in his research. ""I thought if I see my research from that perspective, I might discover something new. That's how I managed to photograph the shadow of ion wind and it was added as novelty in my paper.""
Mr Niazi says that using this technique an oil droplet can be manipulated without touching it. Engineers can use the visualisation of this phenomenon to develop technologies that can be used in biomedicine and in printing.
In the country he comes from, not many his age would dare venture into avenues of learning other than conventional schooling. For Shaheer Niazi, the traditional classroom learning became boring at times. It was then that he turned to other avenues such as books he received from his father and grandfather.
At a very young age he was also introduced to the concept of self-learning. He was only 11 when he first started taking online courses. He has taken 25 courses in different subjects from platforms like Coursera. For toys, he owns a telescope and tools for his scientific experiments.
""When I was a child I used to watch documentaries on science with my grandfather and read books on mathematics and other science subjects,"" says Mr Niazi.
He has an inquisitive nature. His mind is always abuzz with questions and then theories to explain them. Yet, he too seeks equilibrium. Mr Niazi has a deep interest in music and art. He creates excellent pencil sketches and is a self-taught pianist.
He was not expecting the media attention he is now getting. But he is glad he did something that made his country proud. He hopes to get into a reputable educational institution where he can further his research in physics.
Mr Niazi aims big - ""I would love to win another Nobel Prize for Pakistan"" - and he thinks bigger - ""Isaac Newton was 17 when his first paper was published; I was 16 when I officially received my acceptance letter."""
GOTW: Preston v Sunderland,"GOTW: Preston v Sunderland
(Before It's News)
Well that was an action packed week – more than the usual amount of video content in this post as there was a lot to cover!
Last week’s game of the week lived up to expectations:
But then Leeds imploded on Tuesday evening – they were 2-0 down at Cardiff City before Liam Cooper was sent off. You’ve got to wonder if that was a game too far for the Yorkshire club.
Cardiff’s victory means that they’re two points clear of Sheffield United going into this weekend’s games, although both Leeds and Wolves could overtake the Bluebirds if Cardiff lose at home to Derby.
At the wrong end of the table, Bolton are now four points adrift of Sunderland, who are two points behind three clubs on eight points. As I mentioned last week, Bolton are currently worse than Rotherham were last season and are now as short as 1/4 for relegation.
Preston v Sunderland
Just over 80 years ago, the clubs met in the FA Cup Final:
Tomorrow’s game is under slightly different circumstances: Preston are currently fifth in the table and their transformation under former Norwich City boss Alex Neil is one of the stories that hasn’t been given credit so far. The Lillywhites have lost once this season and have only lost once at Deepdale since Boxing Day 2016. Add four clean sheets in five home games this season into the mix and it’s clear that Preston are currently in the top six on merit.
Sunderland – with former Preston boss Simon Grayson at the helm – have been awful so far. They’ve not won since the middle of last month and haven’t managed a victory in a league game at the Stadium of Light since beating Watford in the Premier League just before last Christmas. The main problem is defence: almost half of the 19 goals they’ve conceded so far this season have been scored in either the first or the last fifteen minutes of the game and they’ve already blown leads at Hull City and Sheffield Wednesday. Grayson’s already used 23 different players in league games with George Honeyman and James Vaughan as the only ever presents, which highlights another issue: Honeyman was promoted from the under 23 side and last season Vaughan was playing in League One for Bury. If the Black Cats continue their poor run, it’s not exactly difficult to see what the problem is.
Head to head: first meeting at Deepdale in a league game since October 2006, which Preston won 4-1. The Lillywhites have won half of the last ten league games between the clubs in Lancashire, Sunderland’s last win at Preston came in August 2003. Both teams have scored in eight of the last ten meetings with an average of 3.4 goals per game: considering how bad Sunderland’s defence is at the moment, that might be worth a punt!
The other game to monitor is at the Pirelli Stadium in Burton, where Wolves are the visitors. The 2-0 loss at Sheffield United on Tuesday was Wolves’ first defeat in five games but they’re still only three points behind Cardiff. After a poor start Burton seemed to have turned the corner recently, but a comprehensive 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa (who finally seem to have got the hang of this) earlier this week underlined The Brewers’ defensive fragility.
Televised games: QPR v Fulham (Friday, Sky Sports Football, 7:45pm kick off) is the usual lazy planning, Reading v Norwich (Saturday, Sky Sports Football 5:30pm kick off) would have looked good on paper before the season started but if Sheffield Wednesday v Leeds (Sunday, Sky Sports Main Event, 12:15pm kick off) is as entertaining as last week’s Steel City Derby was then we’re in for a treat…
No scheduled post next weekend, so all being well I’ll be back in a fortnight with a general look at the first quarter of the season.

God Of The Bible Is The Architect Of The Great Pyramid - Unlocking Ancient Egyptian Secrets,"The Pyramid of Cheops, the most beautiful revelation of all times...
 
Pyramid Apocalypsia. Published on September 23, 2017, by Jean Seimple.
 
At this moment or your eyes are focused on his words, you do not yet know that your vision of the world will probably change forever.
 
Now your mind is in the future because you are wondering what I will be able to reveal to you. And there it is in the past because you are perhaps thinking back to what you just learned...
 
Yes, take some of your time for the Architect of the Great Pyramid, for, believe me, no one deserves it as much as he does...
 
More than two years ago, we revealed to you that the plan of the pyramid was a very precise map of the Earth, that the chambers symbolized their house before and after a catastrophe and indicated their respective geographical positions.

This house was found in Antarctica, formerly called Atlantis, and thanks to the coordinates provided by the pyramid and to the NASA radar maps, we located under the ice of the Antarctic, two cities corresponding exactly to the description given by Plato.
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=794x10000:format=jpg/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/i61f7cd5fa873a8bf/version/1506037499/image.jpg"">
 
We also revealed to you that the meridian of Greenwich secretly commemorated the present position of Atlantis, as the meridian of the pyramid indicated its previous position. We have transmitted to you the warning messages of the pyramid, the secret links between the pyramid of Kheops and the Bible as well as dozens of other information... Today we will make another revelation... the most beautiful revelation of all time....
 
What you will learn in this article is simply to understand how the Great Architect of the Pyramid worked, the references he used, the method, the information he wanted to convey.
 
This is the original plan of the Great Architect and what we are going to discover together, far exceeds what we could perceive until now. What we discovered is simply extraordinary, and the conclusions that follow are vertiginous...
 
On December 6, 2016, we showed a video [2], that the Great Pyramid was an extremely precise representation of our planet, for it included in its dimensions the factor of flattening of the earth calculated by Isaac Newton in 1684 according to the laws of universal gravitation which he had just discovered.
 
For those who are allergic to the terms a little complicated, the factor of flattening of our planet comes from a little ""belly"" at the equator due to its rotation and that the poles are slightly flattened. It is therefore not a perfect sphere.
 
<img src=""http://www.liceocecioni.gov.it/sitorecupero/percorsi/scienzeprime/forma_terra/forza_centrifuga.jpg"">
 
The ellipsoid is exaggerated for ease of reading.
 
This very precise flattening factor acts as a signature affixed to the bottom of a sheet, which makes it unique and makes it possible to identify our planet. He tells us that there are 11 km less at the pole, which is in this "" little belly"" [A] (The details of the mathematical calculations will be presented in appendix so as not to weigh down the article and will be noted with a letter.)
 
Following this video, we received a few remarks explaining that the flattening factor of our planet accepted by the scientific community, was not quite the same as the one we used in our calculations.
 
<img src=""http://statusmind.com/images/2016/06/Wise-Quotes-61604-statusmind.com.jpg"">
 
This remark was rather odd since the usual argument of detractors against non-patented researchers is that we should base ourselves on true scientific facts and by referring to one of the greatest scientists, some still questioned our results by rejecting our scientific reference.
 
Nevertheless, experience has taught me that we must always listen attentively to criticism, for if it is posited in a legitimate and courteous manner, it will only benefit it for enrichment and knowledge Of each of us.
 
First of all, we must put these elements in perspective:
 
The difference between the value, 0.004347 or 1/230 of Newton [3] and the official value, 0.003355 or 1/298 of the World Geodetic System, W.G.S [4] corresponds to a difference of only 3 km [B] for the polar and equatorial rays of the earth, (the belly is 14 km instead of 11 km...) on a scale of over 6300 km! Let us admit that we should not throw the baby with the bath water.

Small reminder: circumference earth / A scale / Rate flattening of Newton = 921.72 m.With the current rate of our planet, the perimeter of the pyramid would be equal to 1196 m.
 
This rate of flattening of our planet is obviously not fixed in time and is modified according to the distribution of the masses composing it, continental shelf, oceans, magma, etc. as shown by this scientist news [5], who explains that the earth is tending towards a flattening.
 
Those who follow our work, know that we have presented to you the message of the builders, who explains that the earth suffered a severe cataclysm about 11,000 years ago, during which the Antarctic continent was displaced, Position closer to the equator, towards its present position at the South Pole.
 
In 1955, convinced by the work of American academic Charles Hutchins Hapgood, Albert Einstein had given a scientific explanation for this brutal displacement of the earth's crust [6].
 
<img src=""http://dormir-moins-bete.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/maxresdefault1.jpg"">
 
All the information that we have decoded has invariably confirmed this message and the only obstacle for our theory to become a reality is that Antarctica has been at the South Pole for at least several million years, according to the scientific community.
 
Except that this obstacle which seemed to us impassable also fell, thanks to the scientific evidence that we published on June 4, 2017, through a video Which shows that in the recent past, Antarctica could not be at the South Pole.
 
This microscopic plant sample comes from a piece of peat moss in perfect preservation, as freeze-dried, that is to say, it has undergone a rapid freezing and therefore supports our hypothesis of a brutal displacement of the continent Antarctica.

This piece of wood was also found just beneath the surface, close to the geographic South Pole, the coldest place on earth and the scientist's words are eloquent, this piece of tree date of a relatively recent period and is not fossilized, but petrified and could If ignited, still burn ...
 
What does the Newton flattening factor tell us?
 
He tells us, mathematically, that the polar ray of the Earth (polar does not mean north and here we are talking about the South Pole) was smaller by 3 km compared to today...
 
Antarctica, which I remind you, has an area of more than 14 million square kilometers, far more than Europe, 10 million km², is the highest continent in the world, with an average altitude of 2300m, an eastern plateau of about ten million square kilometers, covered with an important layer of ice that can reach more than 4000 meters [9], so the geographic South Pole has an altitude of 2,835 km... [10]

This means that if you withdraw the Antarctic from the South Pole, the polar radius will decrease by about 3 km because you will have a simple pack ice of just 3 m of altitude comparable to that of the North Pole because of The absence of a continental plateau [11]

Antarctica at the South and Pole Before its displacement.
 
And since this continent did not volatilize, it increased the equatorial radius by about 3 km (we know that Antarctica was not at the equator), this flattening factor of 1/230, Is a mathematical and symbolic way of indicating the displacement of the Antarctic!
 
Now let us put this hypothesis:
 
that this Great Architect knew the exact dimensions of our planet and therefore the official geometrical flattening factor of 1/298, but that he deliberately used that of 1/230, to transmit this information to us, which is obviously, Of great importance.
 
Now we have to prove it to you...
 
The demonstration.
 
To demonstrate this conjecture, we must develop this mathematical demonstration. In other words, to show you that the Architect knew the true rate of flattening of our planet and therefore the dimensions of the Earth that are used by all the scientists of our time.
 
How could the Architect find a way to reconcile these two apparently contradictory elements? The answer is simple: it is the greatest intelligence that has been given me to see and an unimaginable will. Eloquent remarks which seem to you a little abusive... Well no, it is the strict truth. When I understood the plan of the architect, shivers ran through my body...
 
In short, let us stop the suspense and without further delay, let us begin these explanations and especially this demonstration. Do not be afraid; we will proceed as usual in the simplest and most clearly possible way, all embellished with illustrations so that everyone can easily understand it.
 
Here are the official dimensions [12] of our planet, which correspond to the flattening factor of 1/298 of the WGS.
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/i65f00b8764d02ee6/version/1505323097/image.jpg"">
 
The calculation of the flattening rate of 1/298 is explained in the image :
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/i524ce8d433e94b44/version/1505323097/image.jpg"">
 
The next sketch shows you what is called the average volumetric radius; it simply corresponds to the earth's radius if it was a perfect sphere while preserving its volume. In a way, it is the true dimension of our planet, because, without any outside influence, it would have that radius.
 
Its computation is somewhat complex and does not correspond exactly to the average of the two radii.
 
More simply, its value is given to us by the WGS: 6371 km
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/iede232aca7876bc8/version/1505323098/image.jpg"">
 
Now we will calculate the proportion between these two figures... why? Because proportion is the universal way to convey information. If the radius of the Earth is 6371 km for a Frenchman, It is 3958,756 miles for an American. By using a proportion, they will both have the same value.
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/none/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/i785eec280f8df529/version/1505323098/image.jpg"">
 
6378.137 km / 6371.008 km = 1.0011189...
 
This geometric proportion is a unique and universal signature of our planet, it is very evolved since, in addition to its dimensions, it includes the exact volume of the earth.
 
Whatever the standard you use, even an imaginary palm, you will find this geometric proportion.
 
To do this, you have to know the exact dimensions of the earth with your standard and know how to calculate the average volumetric radius of the perfect earth, in order to find this proportion.
 
So the Architect has a geometric proportion based, remember, on the exact dimensions of the earth and now he needs a standard [13].
 
What is this standard chosen by our architect?
 
The answer to this question, I found it, and it is extraordinary
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=970x10000:format=jpg/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/i85d41fd94d4d5e21/version/1505778888/image.jpg"">
 
The architect has chosen for standard: the Time !
 
Yes, it's incredible, Time! It sounds insane, but you will understand everything.
 
The architect chose the Time that our planet takes to make a turn on itself in 24 hours, 86,400 seconds [14].
 
This time that our planet makes a turn on itself is indirectly the circumference of the earth but above all, it's flattening! (Time > speed >centrifugal force > flattening.)
 
Earth rotation. (Photo Wikipedia)
 
We will now reduce the scale of this standard of 86400 seconds and divide it by ten million, which is also the official scale used for the meter...
 
We obtain by this principle a percentage of 8.64%.
 
This percentage, I will convert it into multiplier coefficient.
 
To make simple, here an example : 400 + 2% = 408, it is also 400 x 1.02 = 408
 
So we have a coefficient of 1.0864.
 
Here are the dimensions of the Pyramid of Cheops [15] :
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=670x10000:format=jpg/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/id4cc130faa19afb8/version/1506024878/image.jpg"">
 
We have an average perimeter of: 230.357 x 4 = 921.42 m or 0.92142 km
 
I will now take the exact geometric proportion of our planet quoted above: 1.0011189 and divide it by our coefficient 1.0864.
 
Here is the result :
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=640x10000:format=jpg/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/i74ac61c1a3088c4d/version/1506029772/image.jpg"">
 
An accuracy of 8 cm on practically 1 km ! The unit of measure in km does not matter, only the proportion, if we want a result of 921.5m, just multiply the geometric rate, 1,00011189 per thousand. This is what we are going to do to be consistent with the plan of the architect.
 
As a result our standard of 1.0864, becomes a metric standard of 1.0864 m.
 
What can we deduce from it? Two things:
 
 
That the Architect knew perfectly the dimensions of our planet, its factor of flattening of 1/298 or 0.0033528... and of its average volumetric radius computed by the World Geodetic System of the Earth.
 
That the Architect used the time and the 86400 seconds of a 24-hour day.
 
 
We will now enter into a little deeper reflection.
 
Starting from Newton's flattening factor (1/230), I fell practically on the same result, so the stantard of Architect 1.0864 must theoretically correspond to Newton's flattening factor...
 
Here is the rate of Newton: 1/230 or 0.004347
 
I will multiply this rate by 1000 (as the Architect did with the geometric rate), we get:
 
0.004347 x 1000 = 4.3447
 
This rate of 4.3447 is a calculation compared to a circle, and if I seek a relationship with the standard of builders of 1.0864 meters, I must remain consistent and divide this rate by 4, since our meter does not correspond to a circle, But only a quarter of the ""circle"" of our Earth [16].
 
Rate of Newton : 4.3447 / 4 = 1.08617 (1/230)
 
Standard of the Architect : 1.0864 (1/230.117)
 
We have the mathematical link between 86400 seconds and the Newton rate (0.117 of 230.117, corresponds to a microscopic difference of 3 m on Earth...)
 
We have thus made it clear that the architect knew the exact dimensions of the earth, but that he drew our attention to a different configuration of our planet.
 
A scientist would have noticed the strange similarity with the rate of gravitational flattening or dynamic form factor of the Earth, whose official value is 1.0826 (x 1000 as always); to read for the most curious > [C ].
 
To close this demonstration, here is a second way to confirm mathematically the starting hypothesis:
 
Equatorial perimeter of the earth :40 075,017 km
 
Southern perimeter : 40 007,864 km
 
(Note the last three decimal...)
 
40 041 440 m is the average circumference of the Earth.
 
0.0043456 or 1 / 230.117 the geometric flattening rate of 1.0864 [D].
 
40 041 440 / 0.0043456 = 9 214 248 895
 
9 214 248 895 / 10 000 000 (scale of our meter) = 921.42 m !
 
Perimeter of the Great Pyramid of Khéops : 921.42 m !
 
The architect of the Great Pyramid had simply used the average perimeter of our planet of radius 6372.7 km, which is less than 2 km near that of the volumetric radius ( the perfect sphere of radius 6371 km) shown above and that is all my journey that I wanted to share with you. The rate of flattening of 1/230 that the architect wanted to mount us was before our eyes, with the 230 meters side of the pyramid...
 
I had discovered more than two years ago that the Great Pyramid of was the most magnificent memorial dedicated to humanity, but I could never have imagined that this message of memory could go so far, leaving us Representation of the Earth as it was before this disaster.
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=970x10000:format=jpg/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/idc9dad9942c6ff35/version/1506029848/image.jpg"">
 
The pyramid of Cheops is mathematically the Earth or more precisely, the southern hemisphere of our planet with Antarctica closer to the equator.
 
If the top of the pyramid had no pyramidion or it was gilded to symbolize the sun, it was because there was no land at the South Pole and secretly signified by The Founding Fathers on the Great Seal of the United States of America.
 
The aim of the architect was not to impress us with technical and scientific capabilities, but simply to pass on what happened about 11,000 years ago. He thus left us innumerable mathematical proofs, the only ones able to overcome the lies of men and inscribed in stone, to overcome time.
 
A formidable debauch of energy and intelligence at the service of memory and universal compassion.
 
As I said in the introduction, all this is not yet the most extraordinary, for the conclusion for everyone of common sense and logical spirit is simply dizzy...
 
If the tragedy of our planet is mathematically retranscribed by the rate of flattening of 1 / 230.1 and it corresponds to the 86400 seconds of a day on Earth of 24 hours, what does that mean?
 
What would be the conclusion that a scientist of a man endowed with good sense would draw?
 
That it is statistically impossible that 1/230.1 which mathematically represents the catastrophe, corresponds to our 24 hours and its 86 400 seconds by chance!
 
So it was the architect of the pyramid who had to fix these 86400 units as a reference, to mark a day on earth!
 
The architect of the great pyramid has changed our time in memory of the victims, so that one day we can read and understand his message engraved in the pyramid!
 
For those who read me for the first time and think that this is a mere coincidence, know that the architect has left us extraordinary proofs and that you will discover...
 
After the catastrophe, the servants of this great Architect were sent to the four corners of the earth to restore the peoples who had fallen back to the Stone Age and restored to them all the sciences and the knowledge that they had lost. It was at this point that they explained to the men, that they would now divide the day in 24 hours, an hour in 60 minutes and 1 minute in 60 seconds, for their ancestors, for there was the will of this Great Architect.
 
I had revealed in 2015 and confirmed on December 12, 2016, that your everyday life was beating to the rhythm of Atlantis through the meridian of Greenwich, the reference meridian of all the clocks in the world... today I Reveals you, that time was their blood...
 
If man has forgotten his story, if men kept it hidden, know that time, our time, will always remember it.
 
But this is only the beginning of the most beautiful revelations of our time, as I told you, the most incredible is coming...
 
Meaning of the angle of the Pyramid
 
If the standard 86400 of the Pyramid was the factor of flattening of the Earth, about 11 000 years ago and was written in our time, I will explain, that it also modified the circle dividing it in 360° , A value intrinsically linked to the division of our time with the 3600 seconds of an hour.
 
Do you think you can build a small wall of an exact length of 100 m by putting at your disposal all available technical means?
 
You will answer me, of course, yes and I will answer you... no!
 
You have built your wall, it is extraordinarily accurate with exactly 100 m thanks to the use of a magnificent laser. I now ask you to borrow your measuring device and wait until night has fallen to observe the laser light. Unfortunately, contrary to what you thought, your wall is not 100 m but 99.98 m...
 
A little story, to explain more seriously, that a physical dimension is related to its temperature and that it is therefore impossible to transmit a physical dimension through time without this reference.
 
On the other hand, the peculiarity of an angle is that it will retain much more value over time, even if half the building collapses... another example : draw a square with its 45 ° angle on a deflated balloon and then inflated it... You will see that this angle of 45 ° is always present while all dimensions of the balloon have been modified in space.
 
Is not there a good way for this architect to inscribe his standard there?
 
It was, too, before our eyes...
 
Standard of the architect 8640
 
0.86400 hour = 51 '50.40 ""
 
Angle of the Pyramid [17] : 51° 50'34 ""
 
The standard was inscribed in the angle...
 
Now take the two most famous numbers in the universe: The Golden and Pi and divide them.
 
You get: 0.515036 ! exactly 0.515040 with 1.6180 / 3.1415.
 
This mathematical proportion is universal, wherever you are in the universe, you will find this proportion in this numerical form, and in order to make this immutable proportion correspond with the angle of the pyramid, you must draw up a particular graduation of the circle, Made by the architect of the Great Pyramid [E].
 
A reader once asked me why some megalithic peoples of Great Britain and Armorican Britain as well as certain Cretan peoples, used a geometry based on a circle of 366 ° [18] considered sacred and superior to the ours?
 
Today, I want to answer him, that he did not ask the right question, which was: Why do we have a 360° geometry?
 
The 366° was a natural division of time with the 365.25 days composing a solar year and dividing the circle in 366° was a natural sequence. So it was this one that the men used before the cataclysm.
 
It was not her the sacred geometry, but ours...

The plan of the architect. [F]
 
The height of the Pyramid
 
Knowing now that the master word is the Time, you will, I hope, make the link with the height of the Great Pyramid, proposed by Fabien Pardo.
 
A few months before I discovered this famous standard of time of the Architect on 1 August 2017, Fabien had noticed that the height of the Great Pyramid corresponded strangely to the distance between the earth and the sun but in the past.
 
When he showed me his work, I found it very plausible but above all, incredibly coherent at the date indicated, since it corresponded to the one I was giving.
 
Unfortunately it was not possible for me to connect his research because the architect could not interact on so many factors at once:
 
 
A height that gives information.
 
A perimeter that gives information.
 
An angle that gives information.
 
 
In my opinion it was mathematically impossible, unless it were, the Master of the Circle and Time...
 
Fabien's analysis corresponded precisely to the architect's message of showing us the earth as it was in the past.
 
The height between the ground, our earth, and the pyramidion at the top that symbolizes the sun, indicated the distance between the earth and the sun before the catastrophe. In addition to this extraordinary message of memory, the architect gave us a period to be able to date this catastrophe.

This height gives us for the date a range of about -11,000 years to about -15,000 years, or about 9,000 BC and 13,000 BC.
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=970x10000:format=jpg/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/ie3945a890aaa5105/version/1506029980/image.jpg"">
 
The Height is also related to time [20].
 
We will now open a new door...
 
The date that I give in my book is 8900 BC, (visible in this video at 16'49'') , that I made correspond to the arrival of a planet in our solar system, the responsible for this catastrophe. It is slightly different from that of Robert Bauval who is the author of the theory of a dating with the Sphinx [21] .
 
This date may have finally found its archaeological proof, in addition to the confirmation of the arrival of a star in the sky, with a new scientific study on the famous steles of the site of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, summarized in an article Of the magazine L'Obs, published July 21, 2017 [22] and of which the following are excerpts:
 
"" There would have been, according to them, an important event in the sky 12,950 years ago, and the inhabitants of Gobekli Tepe wanted to preserve the memory of the"" worst day of history since the end of the last ice age. ""
 
<img src=""https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=448x10000:format=jpg/path/s55b662ef4a1e632a/image/i45e12de79442ecbd/version/1505329160/image.jpg"">
 
Detail of a pillar of Gobekli Tepe. (German Archaeological Institute / DAI).
 
Except that the date does not stick according to the archaeologists who studied the site:
 
"" The chronology cited does not stick either: 12,950 years, it is almost a millennium older than the oldest dating of the structures in question. ""
 
Do you think that men drew primitive forms on a stele, the position of the stars as they were in the sky more than a millennium ago? Is it not simpler and more logical that these men have engraved the positions of the stars at the time of their observations?
 
In summary:
 
There was the arrival of a star, but the date must be more recent...
 
This date of 8900 BC As I have already said, corresponded to the moment when a planet was nearest to the Earth and which I naturally corresponded with the date of the catastrophe.
 
But, after a new discovery in 2016, I understood that the disaster did not occur at the same time, but a few years later after its passage.
 
For this time lag between the arrival of the planet in 8900 BC and the date of the catastrophe, I had proposed 40 years, based on Biblical references, which perhaps transmitted information, because I had nothing else.
 
And if the date of the catastrophe had occurred two centuries later... a coherent time in the climatic machinery and a melting of the poles that we hear repeated every day in our media...
 
Two centuries later, long after the passage of this planet and which caught the men by surprise, like a last blow of dagger in the back...
 
And if this date was 8640 BC...
 
Do you measure the consequences?
 
You have two choices: close the browser window because this man is crazy, or firmly attach you and continue reading...
 
If the Great Architect has changed the time once, could he have modified it a second time?
 
Those who have read me guess the answer, but here again, I have to prove it, and the greatest proofs with those of the heart, are the mathematical proofs.
 
So I must prove to you that Jesus Christ, Son of God, the temporal marker of our calendar is linked to the Great Architect of the Pyramid and therefore to the standard 86400.
 
What is the number associated with Jesus Christ?
 
It is of course the 33.
 
This 33... I knew deep down in my heart that he had a great secret, that the age of Christ at his crucifixion had a profound meaning and that it was the will of God...
 
This 33, taken up by the Freemasons as the ultimate degree of knowledge, the one whose secret I wanted to know more than any other number.
 
I finally found it...
 
But first of all I would like to remind you of this: I had revealed the symbolic meaning of the famous phrase, ""The Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit"" on June 21, 2016 (it is not invented...)

Triangle = Holy Spirit, Circle = The Father, Square = The Son
 
To remind you of the anteriority of this analysis and that I do not take it out of a hat, you can find this photo on my site, in one of my videos of June 2016 and in a press article [22] published In the United States dated June 29, 2016.
 
I will now apply the standard of the Great Architect, the 86400 employees for the Great Pyramid, on the 33 of Christ, the temporal marker of our calendars:
 
86.400 / 33 = 2.618

Trump's authoritarian streak,"Washington (CNN) When he looks in the mirror, President Donald Trump sees a strongman.
He vows to rain ""fire and fury"" on North Korea, admires the world's toughest leaders, calls for television networks to lose their licenses and roasts critics on an Orwellian Twitter feed.
But he's an autocrat in word rather than deed.
So far, America's political, judicial, military and media institutions have checked most attempts by the President to stretch his power beyond constitutional norms and to question freedoms embedded in the nation's DNA.
The President's struggle to cement long-lasting political achievements along with efforts by his own aides to rein him in have meanwhile tempered fears of some critics when he took office that Trump was a tyrant-in-waiting.
Yet, Trump has slipped easily into some of the imagery, rhetoric and affectations exhibited by dictatorial leaders throughout history and in illiberal societies around the world.
Seeing an American president, of all people, adopt such behavior has not yet lost its power to shock.
Trump's latest posturing came in the Oval Office on Wednesday, when he warned that it was ultimately his call on whether to strike North Korea.
""I listen to everybody, but ultimately my attitude is the one that matters, isn't it?"" Trump said.
""That's the way it works,"" he added, in remarks that came in the context of the Republican chair of the Senate's foreign relations committee, Tennessee's Bob Corker, warning that the President could put the United States on the path to World War III.
Trump's authoritarian streak is at the root of many of the controversies that incessantly batter his administration, from his race-tainted feud with kneeling NFL players, to the turbulence in his inner circle and scorn for his critics.
It's also the personification of the populist "" America First"" nationalism that is as close as the President gets to a governing ideology.
""He is showing clear signs of an authoritarian leader, most notably by blurring the national and the personal, considering (a) critique of him similar to (a) critique of the country, and accepting none of it,"" said Cas Mudde, an associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia who specializes in political extremism.
""He clearly considers dissent as unpatriotic and doesn't believe it should be accepted or protected,"" Mudde added. ""He craves adulation ... and he seems to only respect military leaders and force.""
Identifying Trump as a leader with authoritarian impulses does not mean bracketing him with monsters of history like Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin. And unlike modern day tyrants in Asia or Africa, Trump faces a robust political system of devolved power specifically set up to thwart tyranny.

And while Trump castigates the press, journalists are not being murdered in droves. Officials are not persecuted when they are ousted from the Cabinet. Trump's political enemies do not disappear.
But within Western constraints, Trump has displayed plenty of examples of imperious behavior that raise concerns that his presidency represents a challenge to constitutional norms and civic institutions.
In many ways, Trump is a politician with counter-liberal instincts operating within a liberal society, who uses the rhetorical techniques of authoritarian regimes.
But it is often difficult to tell when he is serious about a strongman power move or is trolling critics and playing up his reality show bombast.
And the line between his trademark anti-establishment politics and a more sinister form of political maneuvering is not always clear.
Dictatorial behavior is also often in the eye of the beholder.
For many Trump supporters, for instance, his duel with the NFL is a simple matter of reverence for the flag.
""It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday
But that tweet could also come across as a culture war attack against mostly African-American players. And to anyone familiar with state-controlled societies, it recalls efforts by powerful heads of state to impose a national definition of patriotism.
In such appeals to his political base, Trump replicates another technique of autocrats from the Philippines to Venezuela: empowering supporters who believe they are marginalized in their own culture.
""Many of these men are disrupters, they come from outside of politics, they start something new, they have a movement,"" said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and cultural critic at New York University who has written extensively about Trump's ""authoritarian playbook.""
Like many strongmen, Trump nurses an ego in need of constant affirmation.
Those who transgress face ritual humiliation -- see the hostage video press appearances by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and fired HHS Secretary Tom Price in recent weeks.
Trump also understands the centrality of the media in a free society, one reason why he brands unfavorable coverage as ""fake news.""
""It's frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it,"" Trump said in the Oval Office Wednesday.
Earlier, he had raised the possibility of contesting television network licenses over an NBC story that said he wanted to boost the US nuclear arsenal 10 times over. A grab for the public airwaves is often the first move of a dictator, though Trump has little power to follow through on his threat.
Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2017
Trump has also shown a penchant for easily debunked propagandizing. His administration opened with alternative reality claims by former spokesman Sean Spicer about the inauguration crowd . This week, Trump tweeted out a misleading video about the state of Puerto Rico following his government's hurricane relief effort.
Militarism -- another obsession of autocrats -- also exercises Trump.
He has surrounded himself with generals and appears to favor the use of force over diplomacy. He has referred to ""my military."" After he was the guest of honor at France's Bastille Day parade, he proposed something similar for Washington.
""We are actually thinking about Fourth of July, Pennsylvania Avenue, having a really great parade to show our military strength,"" Trump said.
Such a show might evoke national pride, or unflattering comparisons to the rumbling tanks and missile launchers watched by fur-hatted Soviet leaders during the Cold War.
In many ways, it is not surprising that Trump has authoritarian reflexes.
He was a strongman in his own company for decades. He became known to most Americans as a dictatorial reality television star. Then, as now, he held his family close in a power cabal -- and had a notoriously thin skin.
""Most authoritarians in history are extremely brittle, they don't take well to criticism so they surround themselves with family and flatterers,"" said Ben-Ghiat. ""All of this is like a syndrome and I must say, he fits in extremely well.""
Trump's instincts are also reflected in his praise for other strongmen, including China's Xi Jinping, Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and most notably Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he has lauded as a ""tough guy"" and a better leader than his own predecessor, President Barack Obama.
While Trump has made no attempt to replicate the repression of modern Russia, his political narrative of national decline and the need for return to law and order seems like a watered-down version of Putinism. His repeated reference to the nationalistic concept of ""sovereignty"" in his address to the UN General Assembly won approval in the Kremlin.
JUST WATCHED N. Korean official: Trump's UN remarks 'bellicose and insane' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH N. Korean official: Trump's UN remarks 'bellicose and insane' 03:58
In some ways, Trump resembles another populist, nationalist leader: former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who, like Trump, is a billionaire, created a personality cult and faced conflicts of interest while in power.
Trump's populist, anti-globalist instincts also resemble Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, charismatic leaders who took power in democracies and have been accused of eroding freedoms.
The question for Americans is how Trump's presidency evolves.
""While things look bad, and could become bad, Trump has barely achieved anything concrete, in terms of policies -- let alone substantial reforms,"" said Mudde. ""Hence, I don't think we are close to an authoritarian turn, but that is largely up to the GOP, and they seem unwilling to truly stand up to him."""
MacArthur Foundation Names 2017 ‘Genius’ Grant Winners,"“We hope that when people read about the fellows, it makes them think about how they might be more creative in their own lives,” Ms. Conrad said. “It does something for the human spirit.”

The honorees include Nikole Hannah-Jones, 41, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine who writes about the persistence of racial segregation in housing and education. Her work, the foundation wrote, “combines analyses of historical, academic, and policy research with moving personal narratives to bring into sharp relief a problem that many are unwilling to acknowledge still exists.”
The foundation also honored relatively well-known figures in the arts, like the playwright Annie Baker, 36, who won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for “The Flick”; the theater artist Taylor Mac, 44, the creator of the 24-hour piece “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music”; and the writers Jesmyn Ward, 40, and Viet Thanh Nguyen, 46.
The youngest fellow is Cristina Jiménez Moreta, 33, a founder and executive director of United We Dream, a national network of advocates for immigrant youths. The oldest is Dawoud Bey, 63, a Chicago-based photographer and educator whose portraits of communities include “Harlem Redux” and “The Birmingham Project.”
Even some fellows who have already achieved substantial recognition described the honor as bringing palpable relief.
“I feel released from a profound, decades-old financial anxiety,” Ms. Baker said by email. “Now my job is just to wake up every morning and ask myself: What do I want to write? What is the most important thing I could be writing?”
Few honors are as wrapped in mystery and speculation as the MacArthur. Potential fellows cannot apply but are suggested by a network of hundreds of nominators from across the country, in a range of fields, and winnowed down by an anonymous committee of about a dozen.

When the winners were informed several weeks ago, more than one wondered if it was a prank call. “I’m still in a bit of a haze,” Mr. Mac said. “It’s ridiculous. It’s wonderful. It’s embarrassing. It’s all of it.”

Some fellows described taking winding paths to their current occupation. Gabriel Victora, 40, a Brazilian-born immunologist at Rockefeller University who studies the mechanisms by which antibodies become more effective over time at countering pathogens, came to the United States at 17 to pursue a career as a concert pianist before pivoting to science.
Njideka Akunyili Crosby, 34, a Nigerian-born painter now living in Los Angeles whose work explores transnational identity, studied both biology and art as an undergraduate, and, as the daughter of scientists, had to grow into the idea of art as a potential career. “I think of my studio as a lab sometimes,” she said. “When I’m working out a new idea, I try to be as methodical as I can.”

Jason De Léon, 40, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan, trained as an archaeologist studying ancient sites in Mexico, before shifting focus to clandestine migration across the United States-Mexico border, which he studies using a combination of oral history, archaeological research and forensic science.
“I wear a lot of different hats in my work,” Mr. De Léon said. “Most of my career has been defined by making it up as I go along.”
Other fellows include Yuval Sharon, 37, a Los Angeles-based opera director who has staged works in a train station and a fleet of moving cars; and Trevor Paglen, 43, a conceptual artist and geographer whose work explores invisible aspects of military and corporate power.

While only individuals are eligible for fellowships, some winners spoke of the intensely collaborative nature of their work and of the ways they might use the money and prestige to benefit collaborators, including nonprofessionals.
“I have worked with such amazing people from outside academia,” said Betsy Levy Paluck, 39, a psychologist at Princeton who has studied the ways social norms and social networks influence behavior in settings like American high schools or post-conflict Rwanda. “Some of my best ideas are really theirs.”
Greg Asbed, 54, a founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which seeks to improve conditions in the Florida tomato industry, said the fellowship money would be used to sustain and expand the group’s Fair Food Program, which enlists the purchasing power of large corporations to compel growers to improve working conditions. (Mr. Asbed added that he hoped publicity from his award would help persuade Wendy’s, the only one of the five largest fast-food companies not to join its agreement with tomato growers, to reconsider.)

Mr. Nguyen, who won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for his novel “The Sympathizer,” said he wanted to use some of the money to hire an editor to oversee the blog he created for the Diasporic Vietnamese Artists Network, as recognition to the broader tradition that made his own success possible.
“I think back to the first Asian-American writers,” he said. “They were really lonely people back then. They deserve this fellowship, too.”
Mr. Nguyen, a professor of English and American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California who has toggled between fiction and scholarship, added that the honor came with something paradoxical: a new opportunity to fail.
“I’ve always been someone who didn’t understand why we had these boundaries between disciplines, but when you try something new it can be humiliating,” he said. “Hopefully that’s something the MacArthur will enable: to continue risking humiliation.”"

Harvey Weinstein 'sent email plea ahead of firing',"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Harvey Weinstein has said he is the victim of ""false and defamatory statements""
Film producer Harvey Weinstein emailed Hollywood associates asking for help to avoid being fired by his own company, US media report
Weinstein was sacked amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations dating back decades.
In the email, he said he was ""desperate"" for help and called for the film industry to support him, the New York Times reported.
Hollywood stars have spoken of their shock at the allegations.
'Heavy therapy'
Meryl Streep told the Huffington Post she was appalled by the ""disgraceful"" news and praised the women who reported the alleged abuse as ""heroes"".
Dame Judi Dench, who won an Oscar for her role in the Weinstein movie Shakespeare in Love, called the claims ""horrifying"".
The email was sent on Sunday to studio executives and agents, the New York Times reported, hours before Weinstein was fired by the board of his company.
According to those who said they had seen it, the email read: ""My board is thinking of firing me. All I'm asking is let me take a leave of absence and get into heavy therapy and counselling.
""Whether it be in a facility or somewhere else, allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance. A lot of the allegations are false as you know but given therapy and counselling as other people have done, I think I'd be able to get there.
""I could really use your support or just your honesty if you can't support me.""
The email adds: ""We believe what the board is trying to do is not only wrong but might be illegal and would destroy the company. If you could write this letter backing me, getting me the help and time away I need, and also stating your opposition to the board firing me, it would help me a lot. I am desperate for your help. Just give me the time to have therapy. Do not let me be fired. If the industry supports me, that is all I need.""
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Streep and Weinstein worked together on films such as The Iron Lady
Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, having co-founded the Miramax and Weinstein Company production firms. His films include Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and Pulp Fiction.
When the claims were first reported in the New York Times last week, Weinstein issued a statement in which he apologised for causing ""a lot of pain"".
However he later disputed the article, with one of his legal team claiming the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"".
Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that the allegations against him were ""patently false"".
Bloom later announced she had resigned as Weinstein's adviser.
The allegations against him, according to the New York Times report, emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan.
Among the accusations levelled against the film producer are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. In return for sexual favours, he promised to help advance their careers, they said."

"Exclusive: Despite sanctions, Russian organizations acquire Microsoft software","Software produced by Microsoft Corp is on display for sale at a store in Simferopol, Crimea September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Software produced by Microsoft Corp has been acquired by state organizations and firms in Russia and Crimea despite sanctions barring U.S-based companies from doing business with them, official documents show.
The acquisitions, registered on the Russian state procurement database, show the limitations in the way foreign governments and firms enforce the U.S. sanctions, imposed on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.
Some of the users gave Microsoft fictitious data about their identity, people involved in the transactions told Reuters, exploiting a gap in the U.S. company’s ability to keep its products out of their hands.
The products in each case were sold via third parties and Reuters has no evidence that Microsoft sold products directly to entities hit by the sanctions.
“Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and we have been looking into this matter in recent weeks,” a Microsoft representative said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.
“We have robust trade compliance processes around the world to help ensure that our partners comply with all conditions including immediate halting of suspected improper sales by partners, and strong measures to try to prevent banned customers from accessing and using our products and services.”
All state organizations and state firms are obliged to disclose purchases they make on the procurement database. People involved in five of the transactions confirmed to Reuters the software had been acquired.
The Reuters review of the database found state entities in Russia and Crimea that are subject to sanctions have acquired more than 5,000 Microsoft products worth about 60 million rubles ($1.03 million).
The sum is relatively small but such software is vital for many firms and organizations in Russia and Crimea to operate. The database also does not include private companies, so the scale of the problem could be much bigger.
Related Coverage Factbox: Entities subject to sanctions that bought Microsoft products
Among entities hit by sanctions that acquired Microsoft products was Almaz-Antey, manufacturer of the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say a BUK missile brought down a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet over east Ukraine in July 2014, though Russia denies its forces shot down the plane.
Other Microsoft buyers, the database shows, include Glavgosexpertiza, a state design agency involved in work on a new bridge from Russia to Crimea and the “Krym” health spa in Crimea owned by Russia’s defense ministry.
The arms manufacturer, Almaz-Antey, did not respond to a request for comment. The defense ministry’s health spa in Crimea declined to comment. Glavgosexpertiza said “the company operates within the Russian legal framework”.
COMPLIANCE CRACKDOWN

One set of U.S. sanctions prohibits the export by a U.S. entity of any goods, services or technology to Crimea.
Other sanctions bar U.S firms from carrying out transactions with companies or individuals on a list of “specially designated nationals” deemed by Washington to be linked to the Russian government and its activities in Ukraine.
Microsoft did not directly respond to detailed questions about specific users of its products and the compliance procedures it has in place.
The products acquired by organizations hit by sanctions include “Open License Program” services, where the user must provide Microsoft with the company’s full name and address.
Almaz-Antey, Glavgosexpertiza and the defense ministry spa acquired “Open License Program” products, the database showed.

After the sanctions were introduced, Microsoft took steps to prevent entities hit by sanctions acquiring its products, according to five sources involved in the software re-selling trade and a former Microsoft employee in Russia.
But people involved in transactions say ways can be found to circumvent obstacles.
The “Morye” shipyard, based in Crimea, bought 150 Windows Server, SQL Server and Office licenses in June 2016 from OOO Web-Potok, a firm registered in Moscow, the procurement database shows. All the products were “Open License Program” services.
The shipyard fell under the general prohibition on transactions by U.S. firms with entities in Crimea and is now on the “special designated nationals” list.
“If we bought directly from Microsoft, there would be sanctions,” a shipyard employee, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said by telephone. “But there were no problems with (buying third-party from) Russian firms.”
The shipyard declined to comment. Reuters called telephone numbers listed for the supplier, OOO Web-Potok, but the people who answered said they worked for a different company.
Another way to circumvent the restrictions on Crimea-based entities is for the user, when registering the product with Microsoft, not to provide a Crimean address, three people involved in the trade said.
They said addresses in Russia’s Krasnodar region, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea, were commonly used instead.
A supplier who worked with a company on the U.S. “specially designated nationals” list said a supplier and a client could circumvent restrictions by registering Microsoft products to a subsidiary or parent company of the end user."
'No more beatings': Sierra Leone's husband schools take on domestic violence,"BOMBALI, Sierra Leone (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Jobless and jealous of his working wife, Brimah Kanu’s short, fiery temper flared every time she paid their bills or put food on the table for their five children in northern Sierra Leone.
The beatings he dished out made him a familiar face to the police in his hometown in the lush and leafy region of Bombali.
One particularly vicious assault - delivered with his fists and belt - left Kanu’s wife of 18 years with bloodied eyes.
“I was totally wicked”, Kanu, 52, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, sitting in a chair in a small meeting room, while his wife Aminata crouched nearby.
“If any of our five children misbehaved and I beat them, she would come to question me about it, and I beat her too,” Kanu said. “She was provoking me because she pays the bills by selling the potatoes and groundnuts she grows. I had no job.”
Persuaded by a social worker to stop beating his wife, and determined to be a better husband, Kanu took an unusual step.
He decided to go to school.
Kanu is one of more than 10,000 men in Sierra Leone to have enrolled at ‘husband schools’ - where they attend monthly classes to learn about gender equality, domestic violence, sexual and reproductive health and female genital mutilation.
FROM WAR TO EBOLA
While domestic violence is a global scourge, women in Africa put up with being beaten - for arguing, refusing to have sex, going out without permission - far more than those in the rest of the developing world, said a 2016 report from the World Bank.
One in two African women say they accept domestic violence, while about a third have suffered such abuse, the report found.
Domestic violence is widespread across the continent because men tend to see women as their property, while enduring a bad marriage is seen by society as a sign of a women’s strength, said Ayodeji Owosobi, executive director of Stand to End Rape.
“That belief does something to a man’s psyche,” said Owosobi, head of the Nigeria-based civil society group.
“It tells him that regardless of what he does, the woman will stay so violence has become normalized,” Owosobi added. “So, children see abuse in the family as a standard of masculinity, and a necessary correctional measure in the home.”
Struggling to get by in a country haunted by civil war and devastated by the world’s worst Ebola outbreak, which infected 14,000 people and killed about 4,000 in Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016, many men are lashing out against their wives.
“Some men are still traumatized by the way they lost their families to Ebola”, said Lois Roberts Simche, psychosocial lead officer of the ministry for social welfare, women and children.
“There is an increase in gender-based violence because most men can’t afford to take care of themselves and their families.”
“NO MORE BEATINGS”
A man hosts a husband school session in Bo, Sierra Leone, September 26, 2017. THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION / Eromo Egbejule
At the three husband schools in Sierra Leone - which opened in 2012 after starting out in Niger - men not only learn about women’s health, but are also actively encouraged to accompany their wives and families for services such as family planning.
The schools collect data on the men and their families to track their visits to health centers relating to antenatal care, sexually transmitted infections, and gender-based violence.
“All we do with the husband schools is all about improving health of the family as a unit,” said Betty Alpha, program coordinator at the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which helps a local civil society group, the Fambul Initiative Network for Equality Sierra Leone (FINE-SL), to run the husband schools.
Community chiefs ensure that the husbands do not shirk their responsibilities, by enforcing the schools’ resolutions as law.
“Because I‘m part of the school, the men are happier to observe the rules,” said 66-year-old Moiwa Balley, a village chief in the southern district of Bo.
“If a woman goes for antenatal care without her husband, she will not be seen until the husband goes, and that brings shame to him,” he added.

The husband schools are paired with another initiative, the ‘pamama program’, which sees men put into practice the lessons they have learned alongside their wives, and discuss issues such as the sharing of household tasks and the use of birth control.
At one of the sessions, 35-year old Saidu Lamine, who used to regularly beat his wife, Fati, and deny her money for food, said the school had changed his life, and made him a ‘good man’.
Listening to her husband, Fati could not contain her joy.
“He has changed - no more beatings,” she said as Lamine held their baby boy. “He is now a good father and a good husband.”
OLD HABITS DIE HARD
While the husband schools strive to change the attitudes and behaviors of their students toward women, victims of domestic violence in Sierra Leone often lack support, and knowledge of their rights and how to seek justice, women’s rights groups say.
The West African nation passed a domestic violence law in 2007, punishing abuse by up to two years in jail and putting in place entitlements for survivors such as free medical care.
Yet the law is rarely enforced, as victims pursuing justice must pay a doctor to produce a medical report to present to the police, and sometimes cover the cost of a lawyer, Simche said.
“Gender-based violence is more prevalent in rural communities ... and it’s rather unfortunate that most people in these rural settings are not aware that domestic violence or sexual abuse are crimes,” the Sierra Leonean civil servant said.
And for some husband school students, old habits die hard.
“He still beats me but not as much as before he joined the school,” said Aminata, Kanu’s wife, her body pocked with scars and welts she insists are a result of her work on the farm.
“If I get the chance, and enough money, I will run away with the children to my hometown,” she added.

Hitler oil painting attacked with screwdriver,"Image copyright Museo della Follia Image caption The painting is among more than 200 works on display at the exhibition, which runs until 19 November
An oil painting by Adolf Hitler hanging in an Italian museum has been attacked by a man wielding a screwdriver.
The untitled work was damaged by a 40-year-old man who was outraged that the painting by the Nazi leader was hanging in a public space, the Corriere della Sera newspaper reports.
It had been loaned by a private collector to the Museum of Salo, on the shores of Lake Garda, for an exhibition called the ""Museum of Madness"" earlier this year.
The exhibition's curator, Vittorio Sgarbi, hasn't changed his view on the Hitler painting, calling it ""a piece of crap"", and has defended its part in the show.
""The exhibition addresses the theme of madness and this picture is perfect. Nothing is as crazy as war, "" he told Corriere della Sera. ""It is not the work of a dictator but that of a wretch, it reveals a profoundly melancholy soul.""
Art attack
Giordano Bruno Guerri, the president of the museum, saw art in the attack on the oil painting as well. ""The show about madness would not have been complete if it did not host an episode of madness,"" he said.
But Mr Sgarbi disagreed, saying that even unpleasant works ""should be viewed with contempt and distance... without reproducing the censorship and hatred expressed by dictators,"" Germany's Deutsche Welle reports.
The painting has been repaired and returned to the exhibition, and its German owner has decided not to press charges against the attacker.

"Song dynasty bowl shatters world record for Chinese ceramics, fetches $37.7 million in HK sale","HONG KONG (Reuters) - A nearly 900-year-old porcelain Song dynasty bowl smashed the world auction record for Chinese ceramics on Tuesday, selling for HK$294.3 million ($37.68 million) at a Sotheby’s sale in Hong Kong.
The small, blue-green item broke the previous record, also set in a sale in Hong Kong, when a 500-year-old imperial “chicken” cup from the Ming dynasty Chenghua period sold for HK$281.2 million ($36.0 million) in 2014, Sotheby’s said.
The 13-cm (5-inch) bowl, used to wash brushes, was fired in the famed Northern Song dynasty (960-1127) kilns in Ruzhou, and was sold to an anonymous buyer after a 20-minute bidding battle.
Such “Ru guanyao” wares -- known for their intense blue-green glaze and “ice-crackle” pattern -- are extremely rare because the kiln in China’s central Henan province had a brief production run of only around two decades.
The bowl, from the Chang Foundation in Taiwan’s Hongxi Museum, is one of only four known pieces of Ru heirlooms in private hands. Since 1940, no more than six Ru vessels have ever appeared at auction, according to ceramics expert Regina Krahl.
“We’ve had in last 20 years a huge sort of influx of mainland Chinese buyers. We’re filling the room with new prices, new interest and that’s what’s really driven the price today,” said Sotheby’s Asia deputy chairman Nicolas Chow, who declined to reveal the nationality of the buyer."
Tesla chief Musk's latest idea: Intercity rocket travel,"ADELAIDE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk on Friday outlined ambitious plans for a manned mission to Mars and a rocket capable of carrying passengers from one continent to another on Earth.
SpaceX plans its first trip to the red planet in 2022, carrying only cargo, to be followed by a manned mission in 2024, Musk, who runs the company and electric luxury car company Tesla Inc, said at a conference in Adelaide.
NASA’s first human mission to Mars is expected about a decade later.
Musk, the chief executive and lead designer of Space Exploration Technologies, said SpaceX has shrunk the size of the rocket ship it is developing to go to Mars, aiming to start construction on the first spaceship in the first half of next year.
As for the intercontinental passenger rocket - a concept familiar to science fiction fans - Musk said, “If you build a ship that’s capable of going to Mars, what if you take that same ship and go from one place to another on Earth? We looked at that and the results are quite interesting.”
He then showed the conference audience a video of images of a rocket taking off in New York City and landing in various places around the world, with words on the screen showing flight times of less than an hour between any two cities on opposite sides of the world. A New York-to-Shanghai trip could be done in 39 minutes, for example.
Musk had previously planned to use a suite of space vehicles to support the colonization of Mars, beginning with an unmanned capsule called Red Dragon in 2018, but he said SpaceX is now focused on a single, slimmer and shorter rocket instead.
The rocket would be partially reusable and capable of flight directly from Earth to Mars, could still carry 100 passengers, and could also be used for fast transport on Earth, Musk said.

Musk’s SpaceX is one of several ventures that have said they want to open up space routes to Mars.
Lockheed Martin Corp announced separate plans for a manned Mars journey on Friday, unveiling concept drawings of a “base camp” space station orbiting Mars and landing craft that would carry four astronauts to the planet’s surface.

“We know its cold, it’s pretty inhospitable, so we start with the robots and then we go down with these landers,” Rob Chambers, Lockheed’s director of human space flight strategy, told Australian Broadcasting Corporation in an interview.
Chambers gave no date, but the planned mission would be a joint expedition with NASA, which aims to reach Mars during the 2030s.
Mars is typically 140 million miles (225 million km) from Earth, and landing the first humans there, after what traditionally has been seen as a six- to nine-month journey, is an extremely ambitious goal.
SpaceX, which Musk founded with the aim of colonizing Mars, is one of several private and government-funded ventures vying to put people and cargo on the red planet, and other destinations beyond Earth’s orbit.
Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin space venture is also designing a heavy-lift vehicle called New Armstrong that will be capable of Mars transport.
Russia and China are each preparing for manned missions to the moon, and Russia has agreed to work with NASA planning a “deep space gateway” space station in lunar orbit, which would serve as a staging post for future missions."

Girl run over by van in Flint as mother delivers water cases,"Authorities say a toddler in Flint, Michigan, has been seriously hurt after being run over by a van driven by her mother, who was preparing to unload cases of water.
Many residents in the city consume bottled water since lead was detected in the municipal water supply. It wasn't clear why the mother bought the water.
Police said Sarah Freshcosy was backing up her van in the family's driveway Tuesday afternoon to unload the water when 2-year-old Jasmine stepped behind the vehicle.
Jasmine is hospitalized in critical condition.
Flint's water was tainted with the toxin for at least 18 months starting in spring 2014, as the city didn't treat river water to reduce corrosion. Experts say tap water is safe to consume, but they recommend filters."
"Arsenal: Mesut Ozil contract talks positive, but he could still leave","Earlier in the season, Ozil said former Gunners criticising his performances should ""stop talking and start supporting""
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says contract talks are ""going well"" with Mesut Ozil, but ""it's possible"" he and Alexis Sanchez will leave in January.
The contracts of both midfielder Ozil and forward Sanchez are due to expire at the end of the season.
When asked to confirm reports negotiations with Ozil's agent were progressing ""positively"", Wenger said: ""That is my understanding.
""The fact we didn't agree last year doesn't mean he wants to leave.""
He added: ""Both players look happy and overall I hope the situation can be turned round, but at the moment we are not close enough to announce anything. Talks are going well.""
However, the Frenchman said the club had not set a deadline to conclude a deal.
And when asked about the possibility of both Ozil and Sanchez being sold when the transfer window opens, he replied: ""Once you are in our kind of situation you have envisaged every solution, yes. It's possible.""
Meanwhile, defender Shkodran Mustafi will be sidelined for up to six weeks with a hamstring injury.
The 25-year-old Germany international limped off with a first-half injury as the World Cup holders completed a 100% record in qualifying for Russia 2018 by thrashing Azerbaijan 5-1 on Sunday.
""We've lost Mustafi for about four to six weeks,"" Wenger said.
""I don't think he will be available before the next international break."""
"Brazil's largest ever corruption probe nearing its end, judge says","Brazilian Federal Judge Sergio Moro speaks as he receives an award from Notre Dame University in Sao Paulo, Brazil October 2, 2017. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal Judge Sérgio Moro on Monday said the Car Wash probe, Brazil’s largest ever corruption investigation, is nearing completion in the southern city of Curitiba, where it started in 2014.
“There are still investigations under way, but a large part of the work has been done,” Moro told reporters in Sao Paulo after a ceremony where he received a distinction from U.S.-based Notre Dame University for his work leading the probe.
Brazil’s largest corruption probe started almost by accident in Curitiba, when investigators went to a local Car Wash to ask owners why the small company had done several international money transfers. From there it spread to several state-controlled companies, politicians, parties and private engineering groups.
But Curitiba remained the host city for almost the whole investigation.

Moro said he is a bit tired due to the workload resulting from the spreading probe, but he ruled out leaving the operation until it is concluded.
He also dismissed suggestions that he could run in next year’s election, despite the huge popularity he gained among Brazilians.

Some pollsters such as Datafolha have included Moro’s name in some early surveys.
“They are losing their time, because this is not going to happen. Simple as that”, he said, adding that he is a professional federal judge and will remain so.
Despite the prospect of work related to the Car Wash investigation to end in Curitiba, Moro said they it will go on in other cities who host higher court instances and also in Brasilia, where several parts of the probe are being conducted by the Supreme Court.

Producer Harvey Weinstein suspended from British film academy,"FILE PHOTO: Harvey Weinstein poses on the Red Carpet after arriving at the 89th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California, U.S., February 26, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo
LONDON (Reuters) - Harvey Weinstein was suspended from the British film academy BAFTA on Wednesday, following allegations that the Hollywood movie producer sexually assaulted several women.
“In light of recent very serious allegations, BAFTA has informed Harvey Weinstein that his membership has been suspended, effective immediately,” the academy said in a statement.
“We hope this announcement sends a clear message that such behavior has absolutely no place in our industry.”
In an article in the New Yorker on Tuesday, Weinstein’s spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister responded to the allegations, saying that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein”.
“Mr. Weinstein obviously can’t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.”
Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Weinstein and several of the women cited in the article have not immediately replied to emailed requests for comment.
Weinstein was one of BAFTA’s New York trustees and regularly threw a lavish party ahead of its annual prize ceremony. His films have been nominated for the academy’s prestigious award four times."

Toyota seeking to halve Japan car models as domestic market shrinks,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is aiming to halve the number of car models it sells at home by 2025, a person briefed on the matter said - the second time this month that a Japanese automaker has emerged with plans to sharply scale back in a shrinking domestic market.
Car sales in Japan have been on a declining trend for more than two decades as the population rapidly ages and young people are losing interest in car ownership. At the same time, global automakers are increasingly focusing their R&D efforts on electric cars and self-driving technologies.
Toyota offers about 60 car models in Japan, where consumers clamor for variety. But it aims to gradually cut that to about 30 by 2025 to make better use of resources, the person said, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak on the matter.
But even halved, the new domestic model portfolio would still beat the 25 models available in North America, Toyota’s biggest market.
The plan comes on the heels of Honda Motor Co Ltd’s announcement last week that it aims to end production at a domestic factory by 2022, cutting output in Japan by 24 percent to focus on electric cars and other technologies.
Toyota spokeswoman Akiko Kita declined to comment on product plans but said the company was pursuing a number of strategies to maintain sales of at least 1.5 million Toyota-branded vehicles annually in Japan. It currently sells around 1.6 million a year.
The domestic line-up for Japan’s No. 1 automaker includes the popular Prius gasoline hybrid and the Aqua compact hatchback, versions of which are also available overseas. It also sells lower-volume models, including the Premio sedan, that are often derivatives of other models.
“As Toyota begins to develop EVs for markets including China, Europe and the United States, they will likely focus on making models which can be sold both at home and abroad,” said Yoshiaki Kawano, manager of Japan/Korea vehicle sales forecasts at IHS Automotive."
Donna Karan Wonders if Women Are Dressing for ‘Trouble’,"Photo
The designer Donna Karan has questioned whether women around the world are asking for “trouble” because of how they dress.
“How do we present ourselves as women?” Ms. Karan said on the red carpet at the CineFashion Film Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday evening. “What are we asking? Are we asking for it? By presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality? What are we throwing out to our children today? About how to dance, how to perform and what to wear? How much should they show?”
The comments came after the designer was asked about a New York Times investigation that found that the film producer Harvey Weinstein had been accused of sexually harassing employees and actresses for decades. Several powerful figures in the film industry who have worked with Mr. Weinstein, including Glenn Close, Kate Winslet and Judi Dench, condemned the Hollywood producer on Monday. He was fired by the Weinstein Company, the film production company he co-founded, on Sunday.
“I don’t think it’s only Harvey Weinstein. I don’t think we’re only looking at him,” Ms. Karan said. “I think we’re looking at a world much deeper than him. I think he’s being looked at now as a symbol.”

In the interview, she restated that thought: “It’s not Harvey Weinstein, you look at everything all over the world today, you know, and how women are dressing and what they’re asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble.”"
Homeland Security Faces Lawsuit Over Warrantless Searches at Border,"By Derrick Broze
The Department of Homeland Security faces a federal class action lawsuit for violating the rights of people crossing the U.S. border by searching their laptops and cell phones.
Attorneys with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday in defense of 10 U.S. citizens and one green card holder in response to warrantless searches at the U.S. border. During the Obama Administration, Customs and Border Protection agents had a bad habit of conducting warrantless searches of cellphones and laptops. Documents released to the American Civil Liberties Union under Freedom of Information Act requests revealed that Border Patrol agents searched over 6,500 people from October 2008 to June 2010.
However, since the launch of the Trump presidency, Homeland Security and Border Patrol have increased their searches. In early March, NBC News highlighted the rise in violations of basic rights, including an increase from 5,000 warrantless searches in 2015 to 25,000 in 2016. This data from the Department of Homeland Security also shows that 5,000 people were searched along the border in February 2017. In response to these searches, four members of Congress introduced legislation that would require border agents to get a warrant before performing a search of someone’s cell phone, laptop, or tablet.
The ACLU and EFF are now asking a federal judge to rule that officers cannot search electronic devices without warrants based on probable cause the devices contain evidence of an immigration or customs violation. The organizations are representing ten different people affected by the searchers, including several Muslims and people of color, a military veteran, journalists, a NASA engineer, and a business owner. All of the defendants were stopped while re-entering the U.S. from business or personal travel. Some of the defendants say their devices were taken into government custody for weeks or months.
“People now store their whole lives, including extremely sensitive personal and business matters, on their phones, tablets, and laptops, and it’s reasonable for them to carry these with them when they travel,” EFF Staff Attorney Sophia Cope said in a statement about the lawsuit. “It’s high time that the courts require the government to stop treating the border as a place where they can end-run the Constitution.”
The complaint lists the experiences of the ten defendants. Diane Maye, a veteran of the Air Force and college professor, said she was “humiliated and violated” after being detained for two hours in Miami after a vacation in June. “I worried that border officers would read my email messages and texts, and look at my photos,” she said. “This was my life, and a border officer held it in the palm of his hand. I joined this lawsuit because I strongly believe the government shouldn’t have the unfettered power to invade your privacy.”
ACLU attorney Esha Bhandari said “the Fourth Amendment requires that the government get a warrant before it can search the contents of smartphones and laptops at the border.”
The Customs and Border Protection believes they have the right to search without warrants as part of their mission to secure the border. The CBP notifies the public of this belief in their tearsheet, which acknowledges that federal agents can search phones and make copies for forensic analysis. The CBP searches are backed by Supreme Court rulings that found people crossing the border have fewer protections under the Fourth Amendment. The court has not specifically ruled on whether or not cell phones are subject to force, although they have ruled that warrantless searches of phones are illegal inside the country.
“Searches of people at the border is an area where there’s a wide gap between what we think people’s rights are and what their facts are on the ground,” Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, told Business Insider. “Various courts haven’t had an opportunity to weigh in on these issues yet, so CBP is operating with a lot of claimed authority and a lot of latitude.”
Until the Supreme Court weighs in, Border Patrol agents will continue to search electronic devices by the thousands. In fact, federal agents along the borders of the United States violate constitutional rights so often that it has come to be known as a “Constitution-Free Zone.” Earlier this year, it was reported that the White House is exploring the possibility of scanning the social media accounts of all incoming visitors to the United States.
In addition, Activist Post recently reported that the Trump administration is using Stingray cell phone surveillance tools to monitor undocumented migrants. When combined with recent plans to scan the face of every person coming in and out of the United States and the growing “biometric wall”, a picture of complete and total surveillance comes into view. The surveillance and police state of America are eerily reminiscent to the post-9/11 plan for Total Information Awareness. This program sought to make every part of American life under the microscope – in the name of freedom and security of course. As of September 2017, it would appear the architects of this surveillance state have succeeded at creating their panopticon.

Kyrgios finds purpose in helping underprivileged children,"(Reuters) - Firebrand Australian Nick Kyrgios believes he has found his life’s purpose in helping underprivileged children and he is planning to set up a facility for them in Melbourne.
The 22-year-old world number 21 said interacting with a young cancer patient at the Australian Open had opened his eyes.
“I think I’ve found my purpose in the last couple of months,” Kyrgios wrote in an essay published in the Players Voice (www.playersvoice.com.au).
“I‘m building something. It’s going to be sick.”
The mercurial Kyrgios is known as much for his volatile temper as his prodigious talent.
He was fined $16,500 by the ATP last year for purposely throwing a game away during his second-round defeat by Mischa Zverev at the Shanghai Masters.
Kyrgios was also docked a point for arguing with the umpire over a close line call in his 6-2 6-1 defeat by Rafa Nadal in the China Open final on Sunday and he has admitted to not being dedicated enough during his rollercoaster career.
“Tennis is a great life – we’re well paid and the perks are pretty good – but it can feel empty if you’re just doing it for the money,” he said.
”I love kids. I get more happiness from helping kids out and watching them succeed than I do from my own wins on the tennis tour. It’s always been that way.
“If my vision is realized, it’s my hope that I’ll be remembered for this more than anything I have done or will do on the tennis court.”

"Waiver Worthy: RB Edition: Latavius Murray, Wayne Gallman Among Must Add Options","Waiver Worthy: RB Edition: Latavius Murray, Wayne Gallman Among Must Add Options
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Week 4 created numerous opportunities for running backs who could quickly emerge as must use fantasy options on a weekly basis. There were some significant injuries (Chris Carson, Dalvin Cook), while others continued to underperform. Let’s take a look at the running backs you are going to want to target off the wire, and which ones you may want to ignore:
Wayne Gallman – New York Giants – Running Back
Paul Perkins has been a bitter disappointment over the first few weeks, with 32 carries for 61 yards (1.9 yards per carry) and 0 TD. You could argue that the Giants need to look elsewhere, even if Perkins hadn’t gone down with a rib injury. Instead that just expedited the process, and Gallman stepped in and showed more upside immediately:
Rushing – 11 carries for 42 yards
Receiving – 2 receptions for 8 yards and 1 TD
A fourth round draft pick, Walter Football compared him to former Giant starter Rashad Jennings prior to the draft. It’s an interesting comparison, as he had some solid seasons in New York and shows that Gallman has the potential to run with the role.
Verdict – Must add in all formats
Latavius Murray – Minnesota Vikings – Running Back
The Vikings lost their dynamic rookie runner, Dalvin Cook, and are now left to try and pick up the pieces. Murray has shown ample potential as a starter in the past, his biggest problem has been more based on injuries than anything (and talk is he’s currently not 100%). In 14 games last season with Oakland Murray averaged 4.0 yards per carry after eclipsing 1,000 yards in 2015. The biggest upside is in the TD department, having scored 12 TD last season, and he’s also shown an ability to catch passes.
There are other options for the Vikings, including Bishop Sankey and Jerrick McKinnon, so Murray will likely share the snaps (though he should dominate the early down work). He may not have elite upside, but we know what he is and the potential for him to contribute. Consider him a must own.
Verdict – Must add in all formats
Andre Ellington – Arizona Cardinals – Running Back
The Cardinals have appeared committed to Chris Johnson over the past few weeks, though it’s obvious that he’s not the running back with the highest potential. Just look at the Week 4 production:
Chris Johnson – 13 carries for 32 yards
Andre Ellington – 5 carries for 18 yards
Obviously Ellington’s 3.6 YPC isn’t going to blow you away, though he was targeted 14 times (team leader) and turned it into 9 receptions for 86 yards. Ellington is never going to be the lead runner, as Arizona looks to limit his touches and keep him healthy, and you also can’t bank on this many targets on a weekly basis. He’s ownable, especially in PPR formats, but he’s not going to be among the top waiver targets.
Verdict – Must add in PPR formats; worth stashing in standard leagues with 14+ teams
Elijah McGuire – New York Jets – Running Back
He exploded for 93 yards and 1 TD on 10 carries in Week 4, and now has taken 23 carries for 156 yards and 1 TD in his rookie season (6.8 yards/carry). He wasn’t the only Jets’ running back who stepped up in the absence of Matt Forte, as Bilal Powell took 21 carries for 163 yards and 1 TD. The question is if McGuire will take on a bigger workload, and if Matt Forte is going to eat into both players touches.
Time will tell how the situation plays out, but for as long as Forte is out (and look for the Jets to be “cautious”) expect Powell to lead the pack with McGuire syphoning off 10-12 touches per week. That brings potential FLEX appeal, and if Powell were to get hurt McGuire would have the opportunity to step in and thrive.
Verdict – Worth adding as depth option, if you have the roster spot
Alex Collins – Baltimore Ravens
The Baltimore offense is in shambles, but Collins was an obvious bright spot in Week 4 as he was by far the best runner:
Alex Collins – 9 carries for 82 yards
Javorius Allen – 2 carries for 7 yards
Terrance West – 4 carries for -7 yards
Allen is going to remain the primary pass catcher, but Collins should get an opportunity to operate as the early down runner moving forward (as long as he can hold onto the football, with fumble issues quickly cropping up). That makes him worth the add as a depth option, but we’ll have to wait and see before plugging him into your lineup.
Verdict – Must add in leagues of 14+ teams
Green Bay Running Backs
The word now is that Ty Montgomery isn’t injured as badly as originally thought, and we know when healthy he’s going to be the lead back. Aaron Jones is the top healthy back is worth adding, while Jamaal Williams is also worth stashing, but neither offer long-term appeal at this point.
Verdict – Jones may be a short-term play, but nothing more
Higher Ownership Options
Alvin Kamara – New Orleans Saints – He exploded for 10 catches, 71 yards and 1 TD, while adding 5 carries for 25 yards. He’s clearly one of the two main parts of the committee, with Adrian Peterson (4 carries for 4 yards) falling out of the mix. Kamara doesn’t offer lead back upside (if Mark Ingram were to get hurt, Peterson will likely assume the opportunities), but in PPR formats he’s a must add.
Thomas Rawls – Seattle Seahawks – He was a healthy scratch in Week 4, but with Chris Carson getting injured Rawls is going to jump back into a prominent role. Of course Eddie Lacy is going to have something to say about that, though Rawls is the preferred addition.
Eddie Lacy – Seattle Seahawks – He was the backup to Carson in Week 4 and turned 11 carries into 52 yards. He’s also hard to trust, and is going to be part of a three or four man timeshare (C.J. Prosise and J.D. McKissic). The Seattle situation remains one that’s best left ignored.

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
A few notes, thoughts and links to previous articles on Gang Green to pass along:
It’s not exactly time to put anyone in Canton after just three games, but the play of the Jets’ rookie safeties have been extremely impressive through two games, especially in coverage. Jamal Adams hasn’t allowed a completion since week one and PFF provided this stat on fellow rookie Marcus Maye earlier today
Marcus Maye played 46 coverage snaps against MIA. He wasn’t targeted once. On the season: 107 cov snaps, 3 targets, 29 yds allowed #Jets — PFF NY Jets (@PFF_NYJets) September 25, 2017
As much as Jets fans knock the play of Matt Forte, he has outperformed Bilal Powell over the past two games, averaging 4.6 yards per carry to Powell’s 2.4. Rookie running back Elijah McGuire has posted an average of 4.8 YPC during that same time period.
You have to tip your cap to Leonard Williams and the rest of the defensive line for an incredible effort on Sunday. There may not have been big sack numbers, but the unit did pressure Jay Cutler while holding Jay Ajayi to 16 yards on 11 carries. Even Mo Wilkerson, who had just one tackle, looked better than he has all season.
If for no other reason, those fans who can attend this week’s game against the Jaguars should do so to honor the great Kevin Mawae, who will be inducted in to the team’s ring of honor.
More important than just getting a win this past Sunday was the fact that so many of the Jets’ young players stood out on both sides of the ball. Take a look at our list here .
. If Brian Winters misses any more time and Dakota Dozier continues to play well in his place, it’s not a good look for Mike Maccagnan who gave Winters a huge contract this off season to avoid having Winters hit free agency.
Defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas got some run at fullback on Sunday.
Defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas played a bit of fullback against the Dolphins, and if you’re wondering if he may see a carry from time to time, it appears unlikely as the Michigan State Spartans used him exclusively as a blocker and receiver in his one season out of the backfield for the Spartans. But….never say never.
For the third week in a row, outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins turned in an impressive performance and seems to have picked up where he left off last season. The same can’t be said for Juston Burris who played well in the opener, but has struggled since.
After facing Marshawn Lynch and Jay Ajayi in back-to-back weeks, it won’t get any easier for the Jets defense as they prepare to take on rookie battering ram Leonard Fournette. After an incredible performance against the Dolphins (11 solo tackles, 3 tackles for loss), Demario Davis and his partner in crime, Darron Lee, may be tested up the middle once again.
Only five days ’til game day, folks!

The Boston Red Sox were looking to make a run deep into the American League playoffs this season, perhaps even a World Series appearance but may already be in big trouble. The team’s addition of Chicago White Sox ace pitcher Chris Sale in a blockbuster deal was supposed to be the catalyst of the run for the hardware. Few pitchers have been as dominant as Sale over the last five years and he was expected to lead the way for a roster stacked with young talent. But in Thursday’s ALDCS opener, Sale was rocked by a power-hitting Houston Astros club that showed itself to be a legitimate title contender in front of a raucous home crowd at Minute Maid Park. .@ABREG_1 and @JoseAltuve27 go back to back off of Chris Sale in the 1st inning to give the @Astros a 2-0 lead! #ALDS #Postseason pic.twitter.com/6adjXOHfb9 — MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) October 5, 2017 Boston’s prized acquisition was shelled for nine hits and seven runs before he slinked off the field in the sixth inning.

Chess in a black box: China's five most powerful people,"(CNN) Unlike the gossipy, open democracies of Western societies, it is almost impossible to know who truly holds power in the opaque world of Chinese politics.
The country is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, in a one-party system, making whoever occupies the highest positions in the party among the most powerful.
Power isn't just held by the politicians either -- influential businessmen and entrepreneurs, the pioneers of China's economic rise, are also fighting for a seat at the table.
As Beijing gets ready for the biggest event in China's political calendar, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party on October 18, we polled 10 experts, asking them to pick who they thought were the top five most powerful people in China.
Their answers on who really pulls the strings were varied, and shed light on the upcoming Congress -- akin to a closed-door election when China's next generation leaders are expected to be unveiled.
Here's who makes up the top five, according to the policy advisers, academics and journalists we spoke to.
5. Li Keqiang
In theory, Premier Li is number two in China's power structure, but his influence is far from assured.
In 2012, he was appointed as the head of government in China, taking over as Premier and second only to Xi Jinping on the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee.
""The general manager of the second largest economy in the world, he has dealt with the complex economic, social, and technological transformation of the largest country in the world,"" China politics expert Zhiyue Bo told CNN, who placed Li third on his list.
So why is he so far down the overall list?
""He's regarded as being a sort of low-profile, not particularly interlinked or interconnected premier. He's got probably the worst job in China. The premier is always going to be taking the rap for stuff,"" Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese politics at King's College London, told CNN.
A former governor of Henan province who earned a doctorate in economics at Peking University, Prime Minister Li was a protege of former President Hu Jintao and rose to power through Hu's power base in the Communist Youth League.
Brown added many of Li's patronage networks, such as the Youth League faction, are believed to have lost their power under Xi Jinping, whose base is mostly made up of the children of former party leaders, or ""princelings.""
""Of course he's got the State Council (the country's primary administrative authority and chaired by Li), of course he's influential, he's trying to get things done, but it's not a sort of political power. It's administrative power,"" he said.
""Power is about initiating, setting frameworks, setting the agenda. Well you can see people doing that, but Li Keqiang is more of an administrator.""
4. Ma Huateng
Living in China, there's only one app you must have on your phone -- because every other person has it.
In a country without Facebook or Twitter, WeChat is a combination of both -- and much more -- and wildly popular.
The company's founder, Ma Huateng, is China's third richest man, according to Forbes , just behind Jack Ma and Dalian Wanda founder Wang Jianlin.
""He wields massive influence because of the ubiquitous use of WeChat ... Several powerful business leaders have had their wings clipped in recent years, but the technology sector has so far escaped relatively unscathed,"" said Tom Rafferty, China regional manager for the Economist Intelligence Unit, who ranked Ma third on his list.
Ma, who is also known by his nickname ""Pony,"" founded Tencent, the company which owns WeChat, in 1998 with his university classmates. Two decades later, he is now the company's chairman and its value has skyrocketed.
Tencent's app, WeChat, is currently the largest and most commonly used messaging system in the world, with almost 1 billion users.
""(China's internet kingpins) have been able to leverage the potential for China to internationalize its internet behemoths to make sure that it remains part of the global internet community -- even with huge restrictions on that global status,"" Rana Mitter, director of the University China Center at Oxford University, said, placing Ma second in his ranking.
It is those restrictions which make working in the world of China's internet so complex and potentially dangerous. Under Xi Jinping, China's Great Firewall is rising higher than ever and new restrictions and censorship on the country's online community are increasing by the day.
""One challenge for tech titans like Ma in the coming years is whether they can keep on the good side of the authorities, as their wealth and influence continue to expand,"" said Rafferty.
3. Wang Qishan
Shortly after taking power in 2012, President Xi boldly announced he was going to tackle China's endemic corruption, warning both low and high-level officials, or ""flies and tigers"" in Chinese parlance, they would be in his sights.
For his tiger hunter, Xi chose former Beijing mayor and 2008 Olympics organizer Wang Qishan.
Since then, Wang has grown to be a powerful, feared figure among Chinese officials.
He's brought down his share of tigers, including the formerly untouchable security tzar Zhou Yongkang and, recently, Chongqing party secretary Sun Zhengcai, a member of China's mighty Politburo and once rumored to be a candidate to succeed Xi.
Rafferty said Wang is often described as the ""second-most powerful"" politician in China.
""He's been an essential lieutenant for Xi ... the president would be a weakened force without him at the top table,"" he said, placing Wang second.
As a result of Xi and Wang's crackdown, conspicuous spending and flaunting of wealth by officials has shrunk dramatically and as a result, Wang's political capital has continued to rise.
But Wang's rise could be complicated by his age. He'll be 69 at the upcoming 19th Party Congress, meaning by custom he should retire.
Additionally, two analysts who didn't rank Wang said his position had been weakened by unproven allegations from exiled businessman Guo Wengui, who has used social media to hurl accusations at China's top leaders from the safety of the US.
Minglu Chen, senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, said while the substance of Guo's claims may or may not be true, they came at a potentially damaging time for the vice-premier, potentially empowering his enemies in the lead up to the conference.
2. Jack Ma
On the surface, he's the flamboyant and personable former English teacher who likes to dance to Michael Jackson tunes.
But Jack Ma is without a doubt one of China's most powerful people and possibly the country's most public face internationally next to President Xi.
Ma, whose Chinese name is Ma Yun, is the executive chairman and founder of Alibaba, China's powerhouse e-commerce site, as well as owning other massive online shopping platforms like Taobao.
His online platforms rake in hundreds of billions of dollars, making him the richest man in China as of September 2017.
Ma has met one-on-one with two US presidents, both Barack Obama and Donald Trump, and single-handedly created a national shopping holiday in China, ""Single's Day"" on November 11.
""(Ma) has displayed vision and gusto in expanding his e-commerce empire,"" Willy Lam, adjunct professor at Center for China Studies at Chinese University of Hong Kong, told CNN, who placed Ma third on his list.
""Even more striking is his determination to leverage Alibaba's massive earnings to spearhead research in high-tech, particularly AI, cloud computing, ""deep learning"" and related know-how.""
But in China no one is untouchable. Just recently billionaire property tycoon Wang Jianlin, Ma's peer on the China rich list, has had to abandon a series of major international deals after coming under scrutiny from Beijing
""Political power trumps everything and anything in the party state,"" Chen told CNN.
But Ma isn't worried, if we put stock in one of his most famous quotes:
""Today is very cruel, tomorrow is crueler. Day after tomorrow is beautiful. Most people can't see the day after tomorrow.""
1. Xi Jinping
When contacted for our piece, Jeffrey Wasserstrom, professor of history at University of California, Irvine, said he wasn't able to pick five different power players in China.
""The five most powerful people are the head of the party, the president, the commander in chief, the author of the book that gets the best display spots in the bookstores these days, and the guy the People's Daily hails as China's most astute commentator on globalization -- in other words Xi, Xi, Xi, Xi, and Xi,"" Wasserstrom told CNN.
China's president and, more importantly, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, analysts say Xi is already the country's most powerful leader since Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and 1990s.
Now with the upcoming Party Congress set to further cement his hold over the Communist Party, Xi's power is only set to grow.
""The President and General Secretary has managed to concentrate more power and demote more rivals than any of his predecessors managed,"" Mitter said, who along with each of the 10 analysts ranked Xi number one.
""That doesn't mean all his opponents are gone,"" Mitter said. ""The next few years will show just how much he can make use of the power he has accumulated.""
A chess game
Perry Link, emeritus professor of East Asian studies at Princeton University, told CNN it was almost impossible to pick the top five most powerful people in China and projecting the mechanics of Western democracies onto China was misleading.
In total, our 10 experts gave us 24 different names who they considered China's most powerful men and women.
Only seven people appeared on more than one list -- the top five as well as Li Zhanshu, director of the Chinese Communist Party General Office , and Guo Wengui, the US-based businessman and perennial thorn in the side of the Chinese Communist Party.
Events of October's party congress in Beijing could change everything -- Wang Qishan could be forced to retire or Li Keqiang might even lose his number two position, the experts said.
But Link said it was impossible to know the thought processes and motivations of China's most powerful men and women given the secretive nature of the Chinese system.
""What people really think is opaque beneath the chess game that they play, and the chess game itself goes on inside a highly impenetrable black box,"" he said."

Denver Broncos President and General Manager John Elway has seen enough after his protest-distracted team lost ugly to the Buffalo Bills in a game that will likely cost them dearly in terms of playoff seeding.
The Broncos were riding high after demolishing the Super Bowl favorite Dallas Cowboys 42-17 the prior week but that was before NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell put his seal of approval on mass protests against President Trump and the nation itself.
32 members of Elway’s own team chose to make their racist political views a priority over doing the jobs that they are paid to do, one of them being $114.5 million linebacker Von Miller who was supposed to be a team leader. One wonders if Elway now has seen enough of Miller’s piss-poor decisions to want to claw back some of that coin.
The result of their stupid anti-Trump tantrum – a 26-16 defeat in a game that should have been an easy win and as a Hall of Famer who actually played the game like Elway understands, it was an unnecessary loss that could not only cost the Broncos the division but a postseason berth as well in the highly competitive AFC West. Thanks to the gang of 32, Broncos fans were also given the middle finger and deserve better in consideration to their fanatical devotion to the men in orange.
As a result of the 32 morons who chose to put their rich black athlete privilege before their teammates, Elway came out and said what needed to be said in a statement sent out through the team’s social media communications channels – “Take the politics out of football” and also strongly emphasized the importance of respecting the flag.
President of Football Ops/GM John Elway to @BroncosTV on players’ National Anthem statements: pic.twitter.com/Q6F9rszh4x — Denver Broncos (@Broncos) September 26, 2017
Elway’s Statement:
I’m one that believes in standing for the National Anthem, and I’ve always believed that. I believe that this is the greatest country in the world. We are very fortunate to live here, but it’s obviously not perfect. There are a lot of things that need to be corrected, and we will continue to work on those things. I’m one that really believes in standing for the flag. I understand the players and the way they felt from the comments that were made earlier in the week. They felt they had to go down and kneel and that’s up to them. Hopefully as we go forward we can start concentrating on football a little bit more. Take the politics out of football. But I think last week was a good show of unity by the NFL and hopefully this week we can move forward.
Now let’s see if his 32 problem children can get their act together before next week’s critical game against the Oakland Raiders (who also lost due to their lack of attention the game plan) or if he needs to start making a list of salaries to dump in the offseason and spend the money on guys with positive character who are team players instead.
Elway’s statement is leadership of the kind that is sorely lacking from the NFL itself and in particularly from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell who is responsible for this entire fiasco.

Asian American rapper's startling comeback,"(CNN) When Jay Park became one of the first and only Asian artists signed to Jay-Z's label, Roc Nation, earlier this summer, the hip-hop world was rattled.
Not that Park, who was born to Korean immigrant parents in Seattle, was overly concerned. In fact, it's the type of thing he's grown accustomed to.
""Me, being Asian-American, I was always looked at as an outsider. I always had to fight for my place,"" Park told CNN during a recent interview.
For an outsider, Park is very much ""in"" at present. The 30-year-old rapper has seen his celebrity status soar in recent months. In addition to working on his debut Roc Nation album, he's also preparing to join the second season of ""Asia's Got Talent"" as a judge. The popular show premieres October 12 across 27 countries in Asia.
""Jay Park has clearly become an icon for those struggling to make a name for themselves,"" said Flowsion Shekar, CEO of Koreaboo, a popular content platform specializing in K-pop with a reach of over 50 million.
""It shows that Asia is not being ignored ... You can be an R&B singer, a rapper, a singer from Asia and have ambitions to takeover a global market. You can be recognized by the greats.""
One can't spin a better comeback story
But success didn't come easy to Park.
Like many Asian families, Park's mom had aspirations for him to be a doctor or lawyer.
""That wasn't happening, because I was skipping school and going breakdancing,"" said Park who joined a b-boy crew named Art of Movement.
Park was curious about hip-hop since the second grade, convincing an older cousin to share music despite the bad words. Counting West Coast gangsta rapper Warren G and the sitcom ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" as inspirations, he started rapping by the fourth grade.
Fortunately for Park, his mom eventually relented and suggested he enter into a locally advertised talent audition, which turned out to be organized by one of the biggest K-pop labels, JYP Entertainment.
Not thinking much would come of it, Park, then 17, skipped out of the audition early to grab fast food at Taco Bell.
It was left up to his mom, who had stayed behind after Park had preformed, to relay the news that he had been selected to travel to South Korea.
And so began Park's entry into the music industry, as the face of K-pop boy band, 2PM.
""I thought I'll go for a couple of years and help my family out,"" said Park.
""At that time, it was just me, and mom and my brother, having money problems. We couldn't pay the electric and water bill.""
But his new life in Seoul proved difficult. Today Park is near fluent in Korean, but back then was only a beginner.
""It was really hard to sacrifice my life in Seattle and do this thing I knew nothing about,"" said Park over the phone from Seoul.
""It was a culture shock, the seniority system, the food and the way they did things. ... For me, it was a hobby and fun, but there, it was training, almost like a job, where you have to practice from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.""
Park complained about the challenges of life in the boy band on his MySpace page. The offensive comments were leaked publicly in 2009 and facing a fan backlash, he left the group.
""We parted ways, and I went back to Seattle ... It is what it is,"" says Park.
New Beginnings
After leaving the K-pop world, Park moved back home to the Seattle area and started working at a used car shop.
While there, he uploaded a cover video of B.o.B's hit ""Nothin' on You"" onto YouTube, inserting his own lyrics and rap.
The video went viral, with more than two million views in less than a day.
""I don't give up,"" said Park. ""I wasn't attached to the fame or the lifestyle ... The main point in the beginning was to support my family.""
Jay Park, originally from Seattle, is now based in South Korea.
The video's success helped him to return to the music business, creating his own label, AOMG. His fourth solo album ""Everything You Wanted"" was released last October, and rose to No. 3 on Billboard's World Album Chart and No. 3 on the iTunes US R&B Chart.
""Me being in the system in a group with the company, I didn't have much to express myself,"" said Park. ""(Now) I finally have the freedom to do what I wanted to do.""
His new album — representing his style of rap, R&B and electronica — is set to come out next year.
""They (Roc Nation) like the image I have now,"" said Park. ""I'm just me.""
In addition to AOMG, he's launched a second label, H1GHR Music Records, with artists from the US and Asia. Through his music, he hopes to reform the image of the Asian male, from being seen as ""people who are good at math"" to be ""sexy too.""
The Korean American rapper is now 30.
He also dreams of working with Rihanna and knows it may be ""farfetched"" to work directly with Jay-Z, but he's ""willing to put in the work to make that happen and one day we'll see.""
""It's still crazy to me that he knows who I am,"" said Park, a longtime Jay-Z fan."
Wait... I Agree With David Ortiz?!,"Wait… I Agree With David Ortiz?!
(Before It's News)
Credit: Matt West.
Time to circle the calendar because this may never happen again….but David Ortiz something that I agree with. Actually, not just one thing. It’s weird, I hope I am not going soft here. Just because he isn’t playing against the Yankees anymore I haven’t forgotten how much of a pain in our side he was for years. Now suddenly I am agreeing with him? This is…..weird. Twilight Zone weird.
He’s right though. We are good, and he even said so in a story by the New York Daily News. “The Yankees look good. Hey, when you’re in (the playoffs), anything can happen. It’s like starting from zero. Cleveland has been playing crazy good, Houston has been playing crazy good. But I always believe in the underdog. The underdog is always my favorite. You never know what can happen.”
Now I am actually interested to hear him when he works for Fox Sports during the MLB postseason games. I was indifferent before but not only did he admit the Yankees are good….but he said he likes the underdog and I have almost cheered for the underdog. I say almost always because 2004 still haunts me and the 2001 World Series I still can’t talk about. But seriously….I love a good story about the underdog.
The Yankees are the underdog. Right now, mathematically the Yankees could still win the division but that looks unlikely. As hot as the Yankees are right now, so are the Red Sox. Both teams won on Wednesday night and the Yankees are still three games out with only four games to play. Counting on the Red Sox to suddenly tank is extremely unlikely.
So right now it looks like the Yankees would play the Twins in the Wild Card game with home field advantage. Assuming that we win and advance to the NLDS then Andrew Miller and the Cleveland Indians scary pitching staff would be waiting for the Yankees. Just like Ortiz said we look good but Cleveland is “crazy good” and no one can deny that.
Photo: New York Post
We would absolutely be the underdog here and with Luis Severino likely starting our Wild Card game that would potentially make him unavailable to pitch until a game four match-up. That part I don’t like so much but….you gotta get to the ALDS first right?
But similarly the Red Sox are also the underdog. Assuming they win the AL East (it hurt to type that) they have to take on the Houston Astros, and they are also “crazy good.” Both the Yankees and the Red Sox will have a tough road ahead of them Dallas Keuchel has had postseason success and they have a strong rotation also. That is a series I would love to watch.
The Yankees have a lot to be proud of this season. We got further than anyone expected and the Red Sox were always considered to be the favorite in the AL East, but our kids have proven everyone that even without the veteran star power we can still win and be competitive….oh and Ortiz was also right when he called Aaron Judge “a beast” who has rebounded big time this month.
The best part about all of this for me is basically reading Ortiz call the Yankees his favorite. He didn’t exactly say it but it was implied. The Yankees are the underdog, and he loves the underdog so David Ortiz loves us.
Yeah……OK that’s weird. Either way, carry on!

Facebook and Google need to own their role in spreading misinformation -- and fix it,"Jonathon Morgan is the CEO of New Knowledge , a cognitive security startup, and founder of Data for Democracy , a global volunteer tech collective. Previously he advised the White House and State Department during the Obama administration about combating terrorist propaganda online. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.
(CNN) Every day we learn more about the scale and effectiveness of Russian influence operations during the 2016 US election. The implications for our political process are ominous, but the problem runs much deeper. For years hostile foreign governments, terrorist groups, and armies of internet trolls have manipulated public discussion, both in the United States and around the world.
We must understand Russia's manipulative attack during last year's presidential elections in a broader context: as a relatively traditional propaganda operation that achieved unprecedented reach because social media companies are either unable or choose not to defend themselves.
Every time our society falls victim to an information attack, we blame the attacker, but not their weapons. It's hard to accept that the platforms we use to chat with friends and share baby photos can have such a powerful impact in shaping democracy. Platforms like Google, Facebook, and Twitter have fundamental flaws that must be fixed if we're going to protect ourselves in the future.
At its peak in 2013, ISIS mobilized tens of thousands of social media accounts to spread their message and radicalize Americans. They created horrific but compelling content, and used their social bot armies to force that content into the mainstream. They were manipulating the underlying mechanics of social media, tricking platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube into amplifying their message to the widest possible audience.
ISIS lit a fuse with its message of hate and violence, but these social media platforms powered the explosion, making it simple to share and spread nearly instantaneously. Years later, tech companies have finally acknowledged the severity of the problem, establishing the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism in June, 2017.
The terrorist group's years-long, highly visible manipulation of our social platforms was a clear warning that hostile actors could use our online gathering places to target Americans. The warning was ignored, and in 2016 we were attacked again. In October, 2016, Obama administration intelligence officials formally accused Russia of meddling in US elections. By March of 2017, New Knowledge, along with independent researchers from our volunteer collective, Data for Democracy, discovered 30,000 accounts that exhibited bot-like behavior in posting on the Trump campaign's Facebook page alone. Fake accounts, run by software programs, are designed to imitate real users and manufacture popular support by repeatedly posting messages to social media.
Yet only now, 11 months after the 2016 election, are we beginning to realize the cost. We have recently learned that millions of Americans were served propaganda by a foreign adversary, disguised as news stories and as persuasive comments by fake neighbors. The tech companies that enabled this continue to accept only limited responsibility, reframing the problem as an issue of free speech rather than admitting that their users were fooled and manipulated.
Yet again, as the country reeled from the deadliest mass shooting in the US history, Google and Facebook promoted fake news about the attacks. 4chan, an anonymous message board infamous for its racist and misogynist content, falsely accused an innocent man of being the Las Vegas shooter.
Despite 4chan's reputation as a hotbed of offensive memes and wild conspiracy theories, Google promoted the content in its Top Stories search results and Facebook promoted 4chan messages on its crisis response page -- which was supposed to be a resource for families checking to see if their loved ones were injured or killed in the attack. Both companies released statements expressing regret for the mistakes and ultimately corrected the issues.
These information attacks continue because manipulating these platforms is cheap and easy. Media platforms like Google, Twitter, and Facebook rely on trust. If enough people trust that a piece of information is valuable, it is promoted to more users. It doesn't matter where the information was published, who authored it, or what it contains.
At one time, this kind of democratic sharing of ideas was the great promise of the internet, where information flowed freely, unconstrained by traditional gatekeepers like government or media companies.
However the internet is not a democracy. Information is controlled by a cartel of media companies, who are not motivated to help their users share information, but rather to profit off of their attention. Google, Facebook, and Twitter know that their businesses profit by deeply understanding their users, and the type of content that captures each individual user's attention.
Their algorithms learn what information attracts attention, then in turn promote that content to exactly the users who are most likely to consume and share it, which in turn gives that content more attention, and generates more profit. As a society, we communicate with each other using products that aren't designed to help us communicate — they're designed to keep us watching.
The flaws in this system are baked into its design. These flaws have been repeatedly exploited, and we're still vulnerable. We're vulnerable to content that grabs our attention, regardless of its veracity or substance. We're vulnerable to targeting systems that understand our preferences, our beliefs, and our politics, and can show attention-grabbing, influential content to exactly the people most likely to be manipulated by it. And we're vulnerable to automation -- fake accounts that invent, share, and amplify information to fool tech company algorithms into believing information will be valuable in capturing their users' attention.
Addressing these complex problems will require significant investment from tech companies, who need to rethink how information is shared and promoted on their platforms. They need new models for promoting content that assess the quality, not just quantity, of user engagement.
In the short term, they need to follow through on promises to flag false or misleading information, and commit to labeling automated accounts so users can distinguish between what real humans believe, and what bots want us to believe.
Most importantly, tech companies need to accept that they don't operate in a vacuum -- Facebook and Google have revolutionized how we communicate as a society. These platforms are where Americans engage in public discourse, and are therefore fundamental to our modern democracy. Every tech worker and executive has an ethical responsibility to protect our democratic ideals.
Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook
It's also time for a sober conversation about government regulation. As a society, we need to decide whether a small number of giant tech companies should be restricted in mining the data they collect about every aspect of lives. We need to decide if we trust these companies to control the information we consume, even when that gives them the control to shape our elections.
Together, the tech industry and government need to deal with the structural problems in our media platforms. Otherwise we can expect to be victims again."

He marched down a damp muddy path, until the forest parted into a poor village named Zangar Town. His message was simple: Vote for me.
Fourteen years ago Mr. Duo did not cast the clean-cut, earnest image voters see today in his campaign posters, which are emblazoned with the word “Transformation.”
During the final throes of Liberia’s 14-year civil war, Mr. Duo was photographed jumping in the air: his torso bare and muscle-carved, his face stretched with excitement after he fired a rocket-propelled grenade at rebels. The picture, taken by the photographer Chris Hondros — who died in Misurata, Libya, in 2011 — became one of the defining images of a conflict that killed an estimated 250,000 people and displaced more than two million.
After more than a decade fighting in the bush, Mr. Duo put down his weapons when the war ended in 2003. Mr. Hondros, who met him two years later, encouraged him to go back to high school and helped him pay the tuition. Mr. Duo then studied criminal justice at a university in Monrovia, the capital, sold wooden planks and pursued roles as an actor. Then he began training unarmed police officers in Paynesville, on the edge of Monrovia."

It’s finally here.
Today starts Game 1 of the ALDS and this is going to be one heck of a tough series. It feels good to FINALLY be in the postseason again, but this is an ugly “welcome back to the ALDS” match-up and the Yankees are gonna have to be on their A+ game to win this series. Here are some key things that have to happen (the most important ones) to get past the Indians.
Photo: MLB.com
1. WIN the first game
I have always liked Terry Francona because he isn’t afraid to take a risk and he is smart. Game one is important to the Yankees because Francona has opted to start Trevor Bauer INSTEAD of Corey Kluber, but don’t be fooled because that is all by design. Normally, managers start their best pitcher one Game one but not this time. Bauer is a good pitcher, but he is no Kluber. Realistically, Kluber is likely to be the AL Cy Young winner at least in my opinion. I think he gets it over Chris Sale.
Photo: MLB.com
Pitching Bauer before Kluber means Kluber could pitch games two and then five on regular rest. Kluber on regular rest is very important to the Indians. They have asked him to pitch on short rest three times last year in the postseason and they don’t want to do that again yet. The Indians ace is lined up for two games in this series. Winning Thursday in Cleveland will give the Yankees momentum, and if you like interesting tidbits like me, teams who win the first game in a best of five series statistically go on to win that series 71% of the time. It’s a nice stat…..and an even better one if Francona knows it and loses. Let’s make the Indians a little uncomfortable and if Sonny Gray pitches a great game and out offense handles Bauer we carry the momentum.

I hate to say it but the first game is basically a MUST WIN. Chad Green and David Robertson will be unavailable for game One, so that will hurt. The last thing the Yankees want to do is drop the first game and have to worry about a potential 0-2 deficit with Kluber on the mound tomorrow.

2. Battle through Kluber & DON’T give up
Game two is going to be hard! This matchup is going to be interesting with former Indians ace CC Sabathia dueling against current ace Kluber. I am intrigued already. The Yankees have a lot of experience with CC on the mound but they have not had much success against Kluber.
Photo: Getty Images
Looking at the Yankee lineup Jacoby Ellsbury has the most success against him at 5-for-19. The Yankees will need to try and drive up his pitch count and capitalize on any of his mistakes which seems unlikely, but so far pitchers have had a rough time in this early postseason so it’s possible. Even if the Yankees manage to get Kluber out early their bullpen is similar to the Yankees and have some great arms like former Yankee Andrew Miller. Luckily in game two Green and Robertson will be available if needed.
3. Rain is in the forecast for Friday
The current forecast has it raining ALL DAY in Cleveland. If that is the case, the game would likely be postponed until Saturday. That would mean three games in a row which could be bad for the bullpens BUT it could be a major advantage for the Yankees. The Indians want to pitch Kluber on regular five day rest as mentioned above…..if game 2 is moved to Saturday and he has to pitch in it he would be starting on short rest. Hmmmm. I like the potential hole in Francona’s masterful plan.

4. Take advantage of Yankee home games
The Yankees have very different splits with home and away games. Their away record this year was 40-41 but at home they are 52-30 if you count their Wild Card win the other night. The Yankees know how to capitalize on their short right porch and have lefty power to send balls over the wall. Not to mention there is nothing like playing in Yankee stadium in the playoffs. Ask Aaron Judge how electric the crowd was Tuesday night. The Yankees can feed off of that energy and use it to their advantage.

5. Arms & bats need to do their jobs
The bullpen is going to be a difference maker here. Both teams have a deep bullpen but there is nothing quite like the combination of Yankee relievers. The reliable Dellin Betances will need to show up and be effective and Joe Girardi will have plenty of arms to mix and match to whatever his binder tells him to do. The bats also need to do their job.
Photo: Getty Images
The Yankees will need Judge, Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius to set the tone and stay hot at the top of the order like the did against the Twins. The rest of the lineup will need to keep the hits going.
The Yankees are the underdog in this series, but anything can happen in the postseason. The Indians had everything go their way in the regular season and want to finish what they started last year with a ring. The Yankees surpassed everyone’s expectations and are hungry to prove everyone wrong.
Who wants it more? We are about to find out….bring it on, Indians!

Iran president defends Guards in show of unity anticipating Trump,"FILE PHOTO - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani listens during a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, U.S., September 23, 2014. REUTERS/Jewel Samad/Pool/File Photo
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran’s moderate president gave a full-throated defense of his one-time rivals in the Revolutionary Guards on Wednesday, as the country’s pragmatist and hardline factions rallied together in the face of threats from Donald Trump.
The U.S. president is expected to “decertify” Iran’s nuclear deal with global powers this week and add its Revolutionary Guards military force to Washington’s black list of terrorist groups under a strategy to increase pressure on Tehran.
The threat of U.S. action has united the two main factions of Iran’s leadership, with the pragmatists led by President Hassan Rouhani who seek greater openness to the West demonstrating their support for the hardline Guards.
During a cabinet meeting shown on state television on Wednesday, Rouhani said U.S. action against the Guards would be a “mistake beyond mistakes”.
“They think that the Guards are a military entity. The Revolutionary Guards are not a military entity. They’re in the heart of the people. The Revolutionary Guards, in all the days of danger, have defended our national interests,” he said.
“We’re one society. We’re Iran. There are no differences between different factions in confronting the plots of our enemies,” he added.
Rouhani, the architect of Iran’s 2015 deal with global powers to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions, won re-election in a landslide five months ago on a platform promising greater openness to the world and reform at home.
During an unprecedentedly bitter campaign, he repeatedly spoke out in public against the political influence of the Guards, accusing them of backing his hardline opponent to defend their economic interests.
In recent days, however, the threat of new action from Washington has prompted a public display of unity from the rival factions among Iran’s rulers.
“Today, the president of America has created conditions where Iran is more united than ever. Today, those who oppose the nuclear deal and those who support it are side by side. We all have one voice,” Rouhani said.
Newspapers on Tuesday ran pictures of the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the guards, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari.
Zarif brief lawmakers on Wednesday about the expected U.S. action and about Iran’s plans for a response, according to members of parliament quoted in state media.
“CRUSHING RESPONSE”
“In the closed session Zarif emphasized that if the Americans take any steps against the nuclear deal that the Islamic Republic of Iran will give them a more crushing response,” Shahbaz Hassanpour, a lawmaker representing the city of Sirjan, told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
Lawmakers did not disclose the specific actions that Zarif had discussed as plans for Iranian retaliation.
Trump’s expected move to decertify the nuclear deal would not by itself withdraw the United States from the agreement, but would pass that decision on to Congress, requiring lawmakers to decide within 60 days whether to re-impose sanctions.
The nuclear deal is supported by Washington’s European allies Britain, France and Germany, as well as by Russia and China, all of which say Iran has complied so far.
Adding the Guards to the terrorism blacklist could have economic consequences, since the elite military force also has a vast business empire in Iran. International banks are required to make sure their clients are not blacklisted.
Washington has already blacklisted other entities and individuals for supporting Guards’ activities, but has not yet blacklisted the Guards themselves.
During the meeting with Zarif, parliament members expressed their support for the Guards, Hassanpour said. Zarif also noted during the session that European countries will continue backing the nuclear deal regardless of what actions the U.S may take, Hassanpour told IRNA."
Turkey could look elsewhere if Russia won't share missile technology: minister,"Russian S-400 Triumph medium-range and long-range surface-to-air missile systems drive during the Victory Day parade, marking the 71st anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two, at Red Square in Moscow, Russia, May 9, 2016. REUTERS/Grigory Dukor
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey could seek a deal to acquire a missile defense system with another country if Russia does not agree to joint production of a defense shield, its foreign minister was quoted as saying on Monday.
NATO member Turkey is seeking to buy the S-400 system from Russia, alarming Washington and other members of the Western alliance, and President Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara has already paid a deposit on the deal.
Turkey hopes that the deal would allow it to acquire the technology to develop its own defense system, and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, in an interview with Turkish newspaper Aksam, said the two countries had agreed on joint production.
“If Russia doesn’t want to comply, we’ll make an agreement with another country,” he said when asked about reports that Russia was reluctant to share the technology. “But we haven’t got any official negative replies (from Russia)”.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked in a conference call with reporters if the deal would go ahead if Moscow did not agree to joint production, said: “Contacts and negotiations at an expert level in the context of this deal are ongoing. This is all I can say for now.”
Cavusoglu said Turkey had initially hoped to reach agreement with producers from NATO allies.
Western firms which had bid for the contract included U.S. firm Raytheon, which put in an offer with its Patriot missile defense system. Franco-Italian group Eurosam, owned by the multinational European missile maker MBDA and France’s Thales, came second in the tender.
Turkey, with the second-largest army in the alliance, has enormous strategic importance for NATO, abutting as it does Syria, Iraq and Iran. But the relationship has become fractious since an attempted coup against Erdogan in July 2016 and a subsequent crackdown.

"This year, The Day of the Girl is marked by a state of emergency","Story highlights Gayle Smith: The International Day of the Girl is an opportunity to appreciate the importance of girls in society
This year, with over 130 million girls out of school worldwide, we must begin to prioritize their education, she writes
Gayle E. Smith is the president and CEO of the ONE Campaign, an organization dedicated to ending extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.
(CNN) Over 130 million girls around the world didn't go to school today. Millions more braved long distances and dangerous conditions to get to classrooms whose teacher never arrived, or where there were no textbooks or other materials to help them learn.
This is not only an injustice, but a crisis with far-reaching and long-lasting consequences.
Gayle Smith
Today is International Day of the Girl -- a day for the world to pause and recognize the importance of girls in society. This year, with so many girls deprived of an education, we're declaring a state of emergency. We've got a long way to go to help hundreds of millions of girls realize their potential. It's critical that world leaders begin prioritizing the education of girls, particularly in fragile countries.
Africa has the potential to seize an extraordinary demographic dividend. By 2050, Africa will be home to more than a billion youth who must be educated and empowered to boost global economic growth and safeguard global stability.
But girls are being left behind. A new ONE Campaign report released this week found that nine out of the 10 toughest countries for a girl to get an education are in Africa. These countries are not just among the poorest in the world, they are all fragile and vulnerable to conflict. According to the report, in the 10 toughest countries, ""girls are 57% more likely than boys to be out of school at the primary level, and the disparity only gets worse as girls get older"" -- rising to 83% at the upper secondary level.

Me? I just assumed the Yankee bats would come alive based on adrenaline and at least fight back against the Indians. But playing in Cleveland is never easy… and winning against the Indians is sometimes impossible.

I really don’t have much to say about last night other than we gotta move forward and go hard tonight. CC Sabathia is a veteran pitcher and no question has found his groove this season to be one of the better, more dependable pitchers on the Yankee staff. But Corey Kluber is a monster too, and playing in Cleveland, there is no question the fans there will try to get into the older, former Indian pitcher’s head. CC knows this… but CC is a gamer, and I hope he can right the ship for the Yankees tonight.

Sure, it seems so simple, but it’s damn true. They HAVE to hit! They HAVE to pitch well. The Indians really don’t make many mistakes.

And so, it’s Sabathia vs. Kluber at 5pm today.
It’s an intense series already, but wouldn’t it be a hoot if the Yankees could find a way to dominate Kluber, because ultimately, that is the hardest obstacle to climb in Cleveland. The Indians play best behind solid pitching, but if we are able to cut the head off the snake, maybe that puts the Tribe on their heels… and maybe the Yankees confidence will surface.
It is a tough challenge, but the Yankees aren’t here because they were a bad team… they are not! They are solid and they have the tools to pull through. Ultimately though, they need to dig deep and get the job done. This is the playoffs… we’re not playing the Mets here… this is important.
Go Yanks! Do the job! Grind.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, whose new conservative party is challenging Japan’s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 election, said on Friday there was no need for a major change in the Bank of Japan’s hyper-easy monetary policy and there should not be any sudden change under the next central bank chief.
In an interview, Koike told Reuters the BOJ had adopted a hyper-easy monetary policy, adding: “Unfortunately, this has not cured deflation. But I think there is no need for a big change in direction.”
Asked about desirable policy under the next BOJ governor, she said, “There will probably be parts that are an extension of current policy. If there were a sudden change, I think that would have an impact on the stock market.”

India rape: Child's baby 'was fathered by second uncle',"Image copyright NOAH SEELAM/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Campaigners say 50% of abusers are known to the child or are ""persons in trust and care-givers""
A 10-year-old Indian rape victim, who gave birth to a baby girl in August, had been made pregnant by one of her uncles, police say.
Police are filing charges against the suspect - who is the second uncle of the girl's to be accused of raping her.
The first uncle has already been held and charged with raping the girl.
But police began looking for a second suspect after forensic tests revealed that the baby's DNA samples did not match those of the first accused.
Chandigarh senior superintendent of police Neelambari Vijay told the BBC that police were now rushing to also file charges against the second uncle - who is the younger brother of the first uncle.
""It's true the Baby's DNA sample has matched that of the [second] uncle,"" she said.
The next hearing in the case will be held at a local court later on Tuesday.
The first uncle will remain in custody as he is believed to have also abused the child.
The harrowing case of the 10-year-old has made headlines for weeks, both in India and globally, says the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi.
Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of a stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital.
A local court in Chandigarh turned down the abortion plea on the grounds that she was too far into her pregnancy after a doctors' panel advised that termination of the pregnancy would be ""too risky"". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds.
Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger.
The girl was not aware of her pregnancy, and was told her bulge was because she had a stone in her stomach, our correspondent adds. She gave birth in August and the baby was given away to child welfare authorities for adoption.
The girl initially told police and child welfare activists that she had been raped several times in the past seven months by the first uncle to be placed under arrest, who is in his 40s.
She had also testified to the court by video link and very clearly named the uncle and revealed facts about her abuse.
The girl's father had told the BBC that the first uncle had not denied the charges against him. Police also said he had admitted to the allegations.
But after his DNA test results did not link him to the baby, police began searching for more suspects - and arrested a second uncle of the girl's in September.
Image copyright AFP Image caption India is home to 400 million children
The country's courts have received several petitions in recent months, many from child rape survivors, seeking permission to abort.
In most cases, these pregnancies are discovered late because the children themselves are not aware of their condition.
Earlier this month, a 13-year-old girl was given court permission to terminate her pregnancy at 32 weeks. The boy she was carrying was born alive in Mumbai but died two days later.
In May, a similar case was reported from the northern state of Haryana where a 10-year-old, allegedly raped by her stepfather, was allowed to abort. She was about 20 weeks pregnant, doctors said.
None of the girls can be named for legal reasons.
The scale of abuse in India
A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours
More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015
240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18
53.22% of children who participated in a government study reported some form of sexual abuse
50% of abusers are known to the child or are ""persons in trust and care-givers""

BlackBerry details patent deal with Android maker BLU,"FILE PHOTO: A man holds the new BlackBerry Key One during his presentation event before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2017. REUTERS/Albert Gea/File Photo
TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO) said a licensing deal it signed with low-end Android handset maker BLU Products Inc will bring it recurring revenue, ending a legal dispute over patents that rival Google has asked the U.S. government to revoke.
BlackBerry did not disclose financial terms and its shares were little changed after the news, rising 0.5 percent in late Thursday morning Nasdaq trade (BBRY.O).
BlackBerry filed two lawsuits against Miami-based BLU in June 2016, part of an effort by the Canadian company to generate revenue from its trove of technology patents.
Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google responded to lawsuits against a maker of phones running its Android operating system by challenging six of the patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
In late August and early September, a patent office appeal board said that Google had a “reasonable likelihood” of winning the invalidation of four patents in a full review.
The deal between BlackBerry and BLU was likely secured prior to a July 19 memorandum of understanding filed with the court hearing their patent dispute. The two firms have declined to disclose financial terms of that agreement.
BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen said on a Sept. 28 earnings call that his company had received revenue from BLU, but did not elaborate.
It was not clear if that payment was included in that quarter’s earnings, which beat analysts’ forecast on a jump in licensing fees that includes patent payouts and royalties on BlackBerry-branded devices and software sold by others.
Patent licensing deals are typically structured with an upfront payment to cover past sales and ongoing royalty payments tied to future sales.
Market intelligence company IDC estimates that BLU accounts for less than 1 percent of global smartphone market share.
BlackBerry said in its statement on Thursday that the completion of the BLU deal allows it to focus on other licensing targets in the mobile communications industry.
“Anytime you have royalty-bearing licenses, you are setting a market rate,” said David Pridham, chief executive of Dallas-based patent consulting firm Dominion Harbor Group, which recently analyzed BlackBerry’s patent portfolio on behalf of a group of handset manufacturers.
“Doing so with a smaller player will be helpful as BlackBerry turns its attention to larger market incumbents,” he said.
BlackBerry is also waging two other patent lawsuits, one involving Nokia Oyj’s (NOKIA.HE) mobile networking technology filed in February and another broadly targeting Avaya products that was filed in July 2016."

The Jets were granted a roster exemption for wide receiver Jalin Marshall but it looks like they’ve made a move that will clear the way for his return by cutting ties with tight end Neal Sterling. A local product, Sterling was singed after being let go by the Jacksonville Jaguars and had just one catch for 8 yards.
The Jets have waived TE Neal Sterling. His roster spot could be used for WR Jalin Marshall. It also means rookie… https://t.co/JR7p99iJjK — Rich Cimini (@RichCimini) October 5, 2017
If Marshall is added to the roster and made active, it will give the Jets two very similar receivers in Marshall and Jeremy Kerley, with rookie Ardarius Stewart also competing for reps. Marshall had a down rookie season after grabbing headlines in the preseason for making one outstanding catch after another. He would finish 2016 with just 14 receptions for 162 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
Despite the lack of production, head coach Todd Bowles didn’t appear to lose any faith in the promising receiver, getting him plenty of work as the team’s third receiver in training camp even with his four game suspension looming.
It looks like Marshall has been working overtime to keep himself in shape if he does in fact get the call.

Credit Agency Equifax Threatened To Pay Up In Bitcoin Or Else,"By Aaron Kesel
Credit reporting agency Equifax was hacked, potentially endangering 143 million Americans’ social security numbers, birth dates, and other private information. Unless, according to the alleged hackers who hacked them, Equifax pays the 600 BTC ransom (2.6 million dollars) by September 15th, according to a Darkweb onion site.
The supposed hackers note that they won’t publicly post credit card numbers of the credit agency, suggesting they may pawn them on Darkweb carding forums.
“We are two people trying to solve our lives and those of our families,” the group explains. “We did not expect to get as much information as we did, nor do we want to affect any citizen. But we need to monetize the information as soon as possible.”
The hackers appear to have a sense of humor, and how they arrived at that amount is even funnier. Here’s how they claimed to have arrived at the number.
“Three Equifax executives sold 3 million dollars in shares taking advantage of their insider information after the attack,” notes the site. “We believe that 600 BTC is a fair amount.”
Three Equifax Executives Sold Stock Before the Company Revealed Cyber Hack — story on @TheTerminal — Anders (@MelinAnders) September 7, 2017
Ransoming hacked data isn’t new; in fact it’s becoming more and more common with the WannaCry ransomware being one of the bigger giant attacks, recently affecting 300,000 computers in 150 countries, according to Kaspersky Lab.
#WannaCry #ransomware used in widespread attacks all over the world via @Securelist https://t.co/zh012F9lCC pic.twitter.com/UzJVqUwbT6 — Kaspersky Lab (@kaspersky) May 12, 2017
The hackers of WannaCry netted $140,000 gains in Bitcoin from three wallets from their encrypted malware, CNET reported.
Earlier this year in March, Home Depot agreed to pay $27.25 million to affected financial institutions after it had its own breach in 2014. The retail giant isn’t the only business to have been affected by a financial breach. Target was also the “target” one year prior which cost the company an estimated $252 million, according to SEC filings.
If this threat is legitimate, which the hackers warn they can prove, it is up to Equifax whether nearly half of America may have their private data leaked on the Internet September 15th.
“Request a specific part or a specific data from an email that corresponds to Equifax and we will send it to you,” The hackers said.
The irony of this is if the credit agency or any of these businesses dealt in cryptocurrency in the first place they wouldn’t be dealing with this problem because crypto lacks a pull method; you can not automatically withdraw without the wallet owner’s consent, and it also does not label each wallet with its users personal details. Instead, you have a string of numbers and letters that identify each user as a wallet address that can only send or receive cryptocurrency.

"As Sanctions on North Korea Ramp Up, War on Cryptocurrencies Heats Up","By Stefan Gleason
The dangerous provocations between North Korea and the United States haven’t yet escalated enough to rattle financial markets. The U.S. stock market notched another new record high last week, helping to blunt safe-haven demand for gold and silver.
The North Korea situation is, however, causing political reverberations in the crytpocurrency markets. Following China’s recent crackdown on crytpocurrency exchanges, U.S. officials may be gearing up for a regulatory attack on Bitcoin as part of an economic sanctions package.
Enter Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey (D). In an interview on CNN last Friday, Markey said, “The only answer is to go to final sanctions on the North Koreans… The cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which they are using to supply funding to their economy – all of it should be shut off.”
It’s hard to believe the regime needs bitcoins in order to keep its nuclear weapons program up and running. But U.S. politicians have lots of other reasons to launch a crackdown on the cryptocurrency. Chief among them are bringing home tax revenue and defending the U.S. dollar and banking system from free-market competition.
As with the National Security agency’s backdoors into encrypted smartphones, we may not know the U.S. government’s full technical capacity to track or disable cryptocurrency transactions until it is actually deployed (or leaked).
The U.S. possesses sophisticated cyber warfare capabilities. It is widely believed that teams of U.S. and Israeli hackers sabotaged Iran’s fledgling nuclear program through cyber attacks. It is likely that government agencies possess some sort of cyber “nuclear” weapon with which to sabotage cryptocurrency markets.
That advantage of “low-tech” free-market currencies such as gold and silver coins is that they can remain completely off the grid. They aren’t vulnerable to cyber attacks or electro-magnetic pulses.
Precious metals could be subject to conventional regulatory attacks, to be sure. The U.S. has a sad history of banning the private ownership of gold.
But in the era of digital currencies, online banking, and smartphone-enabled day trading, physical gold coins aren’t even a drop in the bucket. They’re more like a drop in the ocean relative to the tens of trillions of dollars in wealth that could be seized digitally.
It’s not the 1930s anymore. Today’s cyber economy offers previously unfathomable financial opportunities…as well as risks.
It’s not a question of whether or not to participate in the digital economy. Almost all of us do to some extent (including whenever we use debit or credit cards). The question is whether or not or to be 100% reliant on digital finances without any grounding in tangible wealth.

Swiss woman abducted in Sudan by criminal gang for ransom: official,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudanese authorities believe a criminal gang is responsible for the abduction of a Swiss humanitarian worker who disappeared outside her home in Sudan’s troubled Darfur region on Friday.
Authorities have intensified the search in and around the city of al-Fashir and believe the gang is looking for a ransom, North Darfur’s Deputy Governor Mohamed Birama told Reuters on Monday.
“We expect that she will be found very soon,” he said.
Switzerland on Sunday called for a rapid and unconditional release of the woman but did not give any other details about her.
Sudan will extend a unilateral ceasefire with rebels until the end of December, state news agency SUNA reported on Sunday, days after the United States lifted 20-year-old sanctions tied to progress on resolving ongoing conflicts.
The conflict in Darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-Arab tribes took up arms against Sudan’s Arab-led government.

SF 8 SD 0
The Giants break out at home behind Chris Stratton and shut out the Padres for their 63rd win. The worst the team can do now is lose 99 games. They won’t repeat the ignominy of 1985?s 100-loss season. It’s a small comfort in a wretched campaign but it is something. I’m happy. It’s the one thing I was clinging to, and it came to pass. The Giants get their fifth team shutout. The nice thing about tonight’s win is that is takes the pressure off Matt Cain tomorrow. He’ll likely be on a short leash anyway so now the only thing that matters is the fans getting their sentimental send-off.
Nick Hundley was this year’s Willie Mac Award recipient. He seems to have made a great impression on the organization and I expect they will push hard to re-sign him. I thought Jeff Samardzija deserved consideration–he never missed his turn in the rotation and was one of only eight pitchers in baseball to log 200 innings. But Hundley, despite a .272 OBA, was a worthy awardee with his timely slugging (23 doubles, 9 homers) and solid work backing up Buster.
Go Giants!

Is it too late to buy stocks?,"The biggest question in money today: Is it too late to buy stocks?
After all, the stock market has rallied for eight years, notching record high after record high. The S&P 500 has almost quadrupled from the low during the financial crisis to top 2,500 for the first time. The bull market is the second strongest and the second longest in history.
There are plenty of risks, of course. Stocks don't go up forever. There is always the chance of what stock market pros call ""an exogenous shock"" -- an unpredictable factor that roils markets. And there is a long list of known risks around the world: North Korea, Brexit, a slowdown in the global economy.
History can be a helpful guide. To match the epic market run from 1987 to 2000, stocks would almost have to double from here, and run almost four more years.
Related: Obama-Trump bull market is second longest in history
So is it too late to buy stocks? It's never too late.
Don't try to pick highs and lows, or time the market. That's best left to the professionals. Instead, buy stocks monthly or quarterly through what's known as dollar-cost averaging to smooth out the fluctuations and risk of buying stocks.
Intimidated by the stock market? Consider legendary investor Warren Buffett's advice: Buy a low-cost index fund tracking the S&P 500.
Ignore peaks and valleys and business headlines. Instead, consistently add to your stocks.
The younger you are, the more stocks you should own in your portfolio. As you near retirement, you need to pare back on stocks and add other less risky investments.
Only about half of Americans own stocks, either outright or through a tax-advantaged retirement plan. That means half the country isn't building wealth in this epic stock market rally."

"Google uncovered Russia-backed ads on YouTube, Gmail, source says","FILE PHOTO - The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Picture
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company’s probe told Reuters on Monday.
The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc (FB.O), but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of Google’s confidential investigation.
The revelation is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year’s election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow’s goal was to help elect Donald Trump.
Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.
Both Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election.
The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called “trolls” who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European, according to lawmakers and researchers.
Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted.
Google’s review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said.
Russia’s ad purchases on Google were first reported by the Washington Post.
Google, owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion.
“We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,” a Google spokeswoman said on Monday.
‘DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY’
Google, which runs the world’s largest online advertising business, had largely evaded public or congressional scrutiny until now. On Sunday, the Daily Beast news website reported that the Kremlin recruited at least two black video bloggers to post clips on YouTube during the campaign. They posed as Black Lives Matter sympathizers who were sharply critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Though the videos were only viewed hundreds of times, they demonstrated for the first time that Russia allegedly deployed real people, not just fake online accounts or bots, to further spread propaganda.
Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into Russian interference, but concern about Silicon Valley’s role has surged over the past month against the backdrop of a cascade of revelations about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda.
A study published on Monday by researchers with the Oxford Internet Institute, which is affiliated with the British university, found that current U.S. military personnel and veterans were targeted by disinformation campaigns on Twitter and Facebook over the past year by a nexus of pro-Kremlin, Russian-oriented sites, along with conspiracy theorists and European right-wing ideologues.
Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms.
“If Vladimir Putin is using Facebook or Google or Twitter to, in effect, destroy our democracy, the American people should know about it,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday on MSNBC.
Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter. While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not.

‘Trump White House’ Reality Show Recap: An Ex-Wife Claims First Lady Title,"Such media fisticuffs were, until Monday, an unusual move for Melania Trump’s placid, and somewhat sparsely populated, East Wing. But they are second nature to certain members of the Trump family, purveyors of high-profile marital drama since 1992, the year Mr. Trump and Ivana Trump, a former model, ended their marriage in what she called “brutal” divorce negotiations. Mr. Trump’s second wife, Marla Maples, ensured another dizzying round of media attention. (The first Mrs. Trump said in the interview that she does not refer to Ms. Maples by name: She is instead known as “The Showgirl.”)
Melania Trump, a former model born in Slovenia, has been somewhat of a departure because she does not court attention and tends to choose her words carefully. She is also becoming a more visible first lady. In the past few weeks, Mrs. Trump has ramped up her appearances and will travel on Tuesday to Huntington, W.Va., to visit Lily’s Place, an infant recovery center that supports families dealing with addiction.

In recent weeks, Mrs. Trump, who once emphasized that her platform will focus on combating cyberbullying, has shifted her focus to learning more about the opioid epidemic. More than two million Americans are estimated to have problems with the drugs, and Appalachia has some of the highest overdose rates in the country.
“She has stated many times that she wants to utilize her role as first lady to help as many children as she can, with the many issues and challenges they face as they are growing up,” Ms. Grisham said. “The opioid crisis is one of those issues, and is affecting children and their families nationwide.”
In August, Mr. Trump said that the opioid epidemic was a “national emergency,” but the White House has so far not made a formal declaration on the matter. When asked about the first lady’s plans for cyberbullying, Ms. Grisham said that Mrs. Trump’s focus “includes many different aspects of what children face today.”
Ms. Grisham did not respond when asked why Ivana Trump’s interview warranted the East Wing’s response. Among other revelations, the first Mrs. Trump said that she uses her phone calls with the president to encourage discretion — “Sometimes I tell him just not to speak that much,” she said — and that she did not mind if her children engage in the sort of Twitter taunting their father enjoys.
“If they are losers,” Mrs. Trump said of potential Trump family Twitter targets, “they are losers, O.K.? And I don’t mind it.”"

Fourth ex-governor from Mexico's PRI arrested on corruption charges,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A former Mexican governor wanted on corruption charges was arrested on Friday, officials said, marking the fourth detention of an ex-governor from the country’s ruling party so far this year.
Eugenio Hernandez, who served as governor of the northern border state of Tamaulipas from 2005-2010, was arrested in the state capital of Ciudad Victoria. He is accused by both Mexican and U.S. authorities of embezzlement and money laundering.
Hernandez served as a member of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which for decades has been battered by corruption scandals.
Corruption promises to be one of the major issues in Mexico’s July 2018 presidential election, with public discontent widespread over a spate of conflict-of-interest rows that have dogged the Cabinet and Pena Nieto himself.
The rows could play into the hands of leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a two-time runner-up who presents himself as an anti-corruption crusader and is the front-runner in the polls.
Prosecutors alleged that in 2007 Hernandez bought a state-owned 1,600-hectare property through an associate, allegedly paying 16 million pesos ($862,730) for the land despite an estimated value at the time of slightly more than 1 billion pesos.
The land was previously sold in 2002 to an associate of Tomas Yarrington, Hernandez’s predecessor as governor of Tamaulipas, for 14 million pesos, while at the time its value was pegged at 866 million pesos, the prosecutors said.
Hernandez and his lawyer could not immediately be contacted for a response and have not made a public statement.
Yarrington himself was arrested in April in Italy and has been charged in the United States for presumed ties to drug trafficking. He has not made a public statement since his arrest.
Two other former PRI governors were also arrested earlier this year.
In April, Javier Duarte of Veracruz state was arrested in Guatemala, accused of siphoning off millions of dollars from state coffers. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Meanwhile, Roberto Borge of Quintana Roo state was arrested in Panama in June just as he was about to board a flight to Paris. Mexican authorities have requested his extradition.
Borge is accused of illicit enrichment, embezzlement and abuse of public office. He has denied the allegations.

DHS explores transforming immigration without Congress,"Washington (CNN) Even as the Trump administration is asking Congress to approve a tough overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, the Department of Homeland Security is also quietly exploring ways it could transform the US immigration system on its own.
The department has been examining a range of subtle modifications to immigration policies that could have major consequences, including limiting protections for unaccompanied minors who come to the US illegally, expanding the use of speedy deportation proceedings, and tightening visa programs in ways that could limit legal immigration to the US, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans.
None of the policies being explored are finalized, according to the sources, and are in various stages of development. Any of them could change or fall by the wayside. Some of them are also included at least in part in the wish list of immigration priorities that President Donald Trump sent to Congress this week, and it's unclear whether the administration will wait to see the results of negotiations over the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that President Donald Trump has chosen to end.
Still, the proposals under consideration illustrate the extent to which the administration could attempt to dramatically change immigration in the US through unilateral executive action.
""Do you think Obama did a lot? That's my answer,"" said one former DHS official when asked how transformative the change could be. ""They could do quite a bit.""
DACA itself was an example of how former President Barack Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction, sought to use executive authority to take action on immigration, putting in place the program to protect young undocumented immigrations brought to the US as children from deportation in 2012.
But the administration is now exploring rolling back more Obama-era policies, and changing even older systems.
DHS did not respond to a request for comment about the policies being explored or its process.
Targeting protections for unaccompanied minors
One effort underway is exploring what can be done about unaccompanied children (UACs), a category of undocumented immigrants who are caught illegally crossing the border into the US, are under age 18, and are not accompanied or met by a parent or guardian in the US. Those UACs, by law and legal settlement, are handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services for settling in the US, given protections from expedited removal proceedings and given special opportunities to pursue asylum cases in the US.
DHS and the Department of Justice have been exploring options to tighten the protections for UACs, including no longer considering them UACs if they're reunited with parents or guardians in the US by HHS or once they turn 18.
In a previously unreported memo , obtained by CNN, the general counsel of the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which manages the nation's immigration courts, wrote in a legal opinion that the administration would be able to decide a UAC was no longer eligible for protections -- a sea change in the way the 2008 law granting those protections has been interpreted.
The Trump administration has portrayed the UAC protections as a loophole in the law that can be exploited by gangs, though experts have testified before Congress that the minors under the program are more likely to be victimized by gangs in the US due to a lack of a support network than to be gang members. The administration also has sought to crack down on parents who pay smugglers to bring their children into the US illegally, even to escape dangerous situations in Central America.
The White House also asked Congress to amend the 2008 law to restrict UAC protections.
In previously unreported comments made last month at a security conference in Washington, acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan said that ICE is actively looking at the adults HHS places UACs with, and if they are in the US illegally, they will be processed for deportation -- and if a smuggler was paid, they could be prosecuted for human trafficking.
""You cannot hide in the shadows, you can't be an illegal alien in the United States, have your undocumented child smuggled at the hands of a criminal organization, and stay in the shadows,"" Homan said. ""We're going to put the parents in proceedings, immigration proceedings, at a minimum. ... Is that cruel? I don't think so. Because if that child is really escaping fear and persecution, he's going to stand in front of an immigration judge to plead his case, his parents should be standing shoulder to shoulder with him. I call that parenting.""
DHS is also continuing to weigh its options to expand the use of expedited removal more generally -- a speedier process of deportation that bypasses a lengthy court process in particular cases -- as authorized by Trump's January executive order on immigration.
Legal immigration tightening
Other efforts in the works include ways to tighten legal avenues to come to the US.
Two policies being looked at are the subject of litigation in the DC Circuit court -- work authorizations for spouses of high-skilled visa holders and an expansion of a program that allows STEM students to stay in the US an extra two years for training.
Both policies were challenged in the courts, and now the administration is considering whether to roll them back.
On the spousal authorizations, DHS told the court as much in a filing last month, asking for extra time for the DHS review to finish.
That filing points to a DHS review of ""all"" of the agency's immigration policies, citing the President's Executive Order to ""buy American and hire American.""
""Executive Order 13,788 is an intervening event necessitating careful, considered review of all of DHS's immigration policies to ensure that the interests of US workers are being protected,"" the attorneys wrote, citing the order's instructions to create new rules, if necessary, ""to protect the interests of United States workers in the administration of our immigration system.""
DHS has also moved to tighten asylum claim credibility thresholds, and is exploring asking Congress for more authority to do so. Another target is reportedly cultural exchange visas, which according to The Wall Street Journal are also under scrutiny after the ""hire American"" order.
Further unilateral moves wouldn't even require policy changes, immigration attorneys fear. Attorneys who represent immigration clients fear that simply by slowing down the visa process, DHS could substantially decrease the number of immigrants admitted to the United States. US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced this summer it would begin requiring interviews for all green card applicants on employment and refugee grounds, and that it would roll out required interviews for other categories over time, adding a substantial and potentially lengthy hurdle to achieving legal permanent residency.
""If the wait time for naturalizations increases by three months, USCIS can naturalize 25% fewer people per year, which would mean millions of people over a four-year period,"" said Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney and former Obama administration DOJ official. ""Even without a policy change, the administration (can accomplish) dramatic reductions to legal immigration through increases in processing times and taking a hawkish approach to finding reasons for denials of immigration applications.""
DHS pointed CNN to statistics showing no increase in the rate of denials of immigration applications, though the backlog of pending applications has grown steadily over the past two years.
Internal jockeying
Sources familiar with the inner workings of DHS describe an environment where political appointees and policy staff with strongly held opinions circulate ideas that sometimes reach the press before front office and secretarial staff are even aware of the discussions.
While political appointees and career officials are not described as butting heads, some of policy ideas do end up moderated by career employees on practical grounds. One source also described some employees of USCIS, which administers DACA, as getting emotional when the plan was made to end the program.
""Once it gets to a senior level, there are pretty robust discussions,"" another source familiar said. ""And once it gets to that level there are folks with ideas, and then folks who have been around for a while who say, 'That won't work.'""
Those competing ideas are then ultimately decided on by the secretary and high-level decision makers, though sources say political appointees are sometimes in a position to have influence over what information flows to the front office and top officials.
""The secretary and the decision makers end up with that (dynamic),"" the source said."
"Ravens Fall to Steelers, 26-9 at Home","Ravens Fall to Steelers, 26-9 at Home
(Before It's News)
The Ravens fell to 2-2 today, losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-9 at M&T Bank Stadium. RSR Staff react to the loss here…
Derek Arnold
I was fine burning last week’s tape. But to lose like this, at home, to your bitter rival? That’s just inexcusable. It was the Steelers’ first win in Baltimore since 2012, and the 17-point margin of victory was their highest here…ever. Yup, ever. Second-most is now 13 in 2002. Great job, guys!
What is this team doing? The injuries are a legitimate factor, especially against playoff-caliber opponents, but the injuries aren’t making Joe Flacco throw off his back foot, nor are they making passes bounce off guys’ hands, nor making the offensive scheme resemble something from the stone ages.
As for the defense, they obviously aren’t as good as they looked playing the likes of Andy Dalton and DeShone Kizer, but I’d like to see what they can do when the offense doesn’t force them to be on the field for 20+ of the first 30 minutes of every ballgame.
The Ravens once again look like a rudderless ship. Those Jaguars that they made look like world-beaters a week ago? Yeah, they just lost to the Jets.
Ryan Jones
There a lot of things about this Ravens team that make you shake your head this week. How was this team not ready to play at home after last week’s embarrassment? How does the play calling remain something that resembles a high school team? How has a coach not addressed Joe Flacco‘s predictable cadence which would help keep opposing defenses off balance?
I catch a lot of flack for my consistent criticism of John Harbaugh and I understand the injuries. But this team will continue to exist in a state of mediocrity as long as Harbaugh is on the Ravens sideline. Harbaugh can’t find an offensive coordinator who can consistently put points on the board and he’s let Dean Pees stick around far too long. Enough with the excuses, this team is on its way to missing the playoffs for the third straight year and the fourth time in the last five years. That would get a coach dismissed from any other team in the NFL. The standard shouldn’t be different for Harbaugh.
Joe Polek
Injuries are decimating this team. They can’t stop the run without Brandon Williams and they can’t keep Flacco off the ground without Marshal Yanda. Flacco looks awful and I sure hope it has something to do with his back and this is not just because he is terrible. It doesn’t help that Ozzie hasn’t done anything to give Flacco help on the offensive of side of the ball for years. The defense gave up a lot of points but I still believe the offense is the reason we lost this game, and the reason this team will not go to the playoffs.
We’ll have more knee-jerk reactions as they roll in…ugh.

Eminem attacks Trump in freestyle rap at BET Hip Hop Awards,"Eminem has brutally criticised US President Donald Trump in a new video.
The rapper calls him a ""racist 94-year-old grandpa"" and slammed fans who back the president during a four-and-half minute freestyle.
""Any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against,"" he raps in the film, shown during last night's BET Hip Hop Awards.
Twitter users can't wait to see whether Mr Trump will respond.
In the video for freestyle The Storm, Eminem is shown in a car park, stepping towards the camera to rap directly to viewers.
""If you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this,"" he says, raising a middle finger.
The 44-year-old slams Trump for focusing on NFL players who ""take a knee"", and causing drama on social media.
""This is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada,"" he says.
""All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.""
The rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, also calls the president racist.
""Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange.""
And he praises former president Barack Obama.
""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops,"" he says.
American footballer Colin Kaepernick, basketball player LeBron James, Snoop Dogg and J. Cole are among those tweeting their appreciation for the freestyle.
But it didn't go down well with everyone.
This isn't the first time the Detroit rapper has criticised Mr Trump.
Last year he released the nine-minute freestyle Campaign Speech in which he calls the president a ""loose cannon"" who ""doesn't have to answer to no-one"".
Cardi B was the big winner at the BET Hip Hop Awards, taking five trophies including Single of the Year for Bodak Yellow.
Kendrick Lamar took four awards, including Album of the Year and DJ Khaled, Nicki Minaj and JAY-Z were also successful.

""I think they prevented a thousand deaths, and I think it's important for the American public to understand that,"" Lombardo said.
Lombardo had traveled to Mumbai, India, after the November 2008 terrorist attacks on hotels and other sites that left 164 people dead. The sheriff gleaned insight from the trip, he said, and the department now reacts more quickly to such shootings, forming a team to ""cease the action'' of the assailant.
""Before we were trained to form a perimeter and hope for the best,"" Lombardo said. ""Now we're trained to gather up and go get it.""

Detective Matthew Donaldson was doing paperwork when radio calls went out reporting an active shooter. He jumped in a car and drove 9 miles to the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, he said in the ""60 Minutes"" interview.
Donaldson ran the last few blocks to the hotel, he said, but he ditched the cowboy boots he was wearing in the casino because they hurt his feet.
""I was faster barefoot and I was going to be more effective barefoot,"" he said.
Not far away, K-9 officers Dave Newton and Sgt. Joshua Bitsko were training dogs when they heard the radio call.
""I just yelled to these guys, 'Let's go. There is an active shooter,'"" Bitsko recalled saying.
The pair drove to the scene. At the hotel, they met up with Levi Hancock, a SWAT officer who was armed with explosives, and zeroed in on the 32nd floor, where other officers had pinpointed the shooting. Bitsko thought there might have been more than one gunman.
By that time, Paddock had shot through the door at Jesus Campos, a Mandalay Bay security officer who had gone to respond to an alarm, striking him in the leg. Police said that Paddock stopped firing on the crowd after Campos approached his door.
'Hurry but be quiet'
The four-man team found the stairwell door to Paddock's hallway barricaded.
""He had screwed shut the door with a piece of metal and some screws in the stairwell going out to the hallway right by his door,"" Bitsko recalled.
The SWAT officer used a pry bar to pop the door open, Newton said.
Down the hall, the door to Paddock's room was riddled with bullet holes.
""It looked like Swiss cheese,"" Newton said.
The SWAT team member quietly set explosives to blow open the door, hoping not to arouse the shooter's suspicions, said Newton.
""Hurry, hurry -- hurry but be quiet,"" Newton remembered saying.
JUST WATCHED Las Vegas gunman's gambling under scrutiny Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Las Vegas gunman's gambling under scrutiny 03:05
They didn't know where Paddock was in the room. It was just over an hour after the last shots had been fired. Bitsko said it was like a ""deadly game of hide and seek.""
""I remember thinking, 'Man, I wish I had my dog with me because it's nice to have him lead the team,'"" Bitsko said.
""Breach. Breach. Breach,"" someone said on the police radio.
The explosion set off alarms. The door was open, and the group swarmed the room.
Inside, the officers found drills and other tools, along with drill bits, phones, laptops, guns and ammunition. They also discovered Paddock's body.
'Tripping over guns'
The room smelled like gunpowder, Bitsko recalled.
""We were tripping over guns,"" he said.
Authorities recovered 23 guns from Paddock's room, police said.
Officers also found a handwritten note with calculations of distance and trajectory from his window to the crowd below, Newton said.
Authorities have received more than 1,000 tips, but are still struggling to determine what motivated Paddock, who didn't have a criminal record, to carry out the attack.
""He had tool boxes and power tools to run wires for his surveillance system. Everything that he had, it took him days to finish,"" Bitsko said.
'Blood dripping on my hand'
The FBI searched Paddock's Mesquite, Nevada, home early Sunday, Mesquite Police Chief Troy Tanner told CNN. In the evening, the lights along the famed Las Vegas Strip dimmed for 11 minutes to honor the victims and heroes of the attack at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, which left 58 people dead and injured nearly 500.
Las Vegas Detective Casey Clarkson was not part of the team that breached the hotel room, but he was among those injured in the shooting, he told ""60 Minutes.""
Crouched below on the street, Clarkson recalled the bullets were like white sparks, ""like powder almost ... hitting the concrete, hitting the van."" Clarkson was grazed in the neck.
The rounds rained down next to the officers at street level. Clarkson wondered how the shooter could be so accurate, he said. He remembered becoming lightheaded.
""It was already ... blood dripping off my hand,"" he said.
But he wanted to help as many people as possible, he said. So he stayed.
This story has been updated to reflect the latest timeline of the shooting and response put out by police."
Ravens Again Abandon Running Game,"Ravens Again Abandon Running Game
(Before It's News)
REALITY: The Baltimore Ravens fell to their arch-rival Sunday and it was never close.
Unless I’m missing something, pretty sure 17 points is Pittsburgh’s largest ever margin of victory in Baltimore vs. Ravens. — Derek Arnold (@BMoreBirdsNest) October 1, 2017
Perception: Yes, there was a point in the 4th quarter that the Ravens pulled within one score (if they had made the 2-point conversion), but it really was never that close. But was it just me, or did this game not feel like the normal Ravens-Steelers rivalry game?
I refuse to talk about any of the non-football things in my articles, and I truly believe that it has nothing to do with the “protests.” Maybe it’s just that the Steelers and the Ravens both played terribly the previous week. Maybe it’s because it was a 1 pm, non-national game. Maybe it’s because… well, I don’t know what it is. But there was no “Steelers Week.” There was no build up. And there was no aggression, no trash talking… it was just another game, and I didn’t like it. I miss the rivalry.
REALITY: Quarterback Joe Flacco has thrown at least one interception in 10 straight games, the longest active streak in the NFL.
Amid valid uproar over Flacco, consider QBs of Ravens next 4 opponents OAK, CHI, MIN, MIA- all using backups. Count your blessings #NFL — Mark Viviano (@MarkWJZ) October 3, 2017
Perception: Man, Flacco looks terrible. I really wonder if his back is much more of an issue than he wants to admit… or at least I hope it is. If it’s not, then Flacco and the Ravens are in much worse shape than we realize.
When I watched the 4th quarter of the Oakland Raiders game on Sunday, against the Denver Broncos, I saw something that I really liked… a quarterback who looked comfortable and stepped into his passes, putting on in the right spots. No, I’m not talking about Derek Carr… I’m actually talking about EJ Manuel.
Is Manuel a great QB? No, but when I watched him throw, I thought, “I have never seen Flacco throw a pass like that.” If Joe Cool would stop throwing off his back foot, a lot of his issues would be fixed.
Everyone wants to blame the Offensive Coordinator. Fans want him fired. But how many OC’s can you go through before they admit there is a different issue?
I had a job once where seven staff members changed, and there was still an issue. Finally, it was realized that he only constant during all the change was the real issue. I feel the same way with the Ravens. When you keep having new OC’s come in and nothing changes, maybe it’s not the OC?
But then again…
REALITY: The Ravens have run the ball 114 times in the first four games: 40 times in Game 1, 21 times in Game 2, 15 times in Game 3, 11 times in game 4.
What happened to the Week 1 and Week 2 commitment to the run????????? #RavensFlock https://t.co/EfKgst07c2 — Joe Polek (@JoePolek) October 1, 2017
Perception: The Ravens brought in Greg Roman to help get the running game back to where it used to be and needs to be. After game one, it looked like it was going to work, but then the commitment to the run game has gone away. From 40 runs, to 21, to 15, and now just 11 in the last game. Don’t say “it’s because they were playing from behind,” because if you go back and look through the game play logs, you’ll see that even in the first half, they went pass first.
I really hope it has nothing to do with Flacco saying that Game 1 “wasn’t fun”… because a win is fun, no matter how you get it. Losing by 30+ is not fun, even if you throw for 400 yards.
The Ravens running backs aren’t game-breakers, but they can do the job. Even with a poor offensive line, Alex Collins has shown he can still be a quality running back. Buck Allen and Terrance West can break tackles and make good plays. So why aren’t they being given a chance? Stop trying to force a passing game that clearly is NOT working.
The couple of times they have tried to run the ball worked and then opened up the passing attack, but they aren’t doing it enough to make it work fully. Is that on the OC or John Harbaugh? We may never know.
REALITY: The Ravens are not a good road team.
Ravens 11 – 23 on the road since 2012 SB win. (3 of those wins vs Browns) Only road wins outside AFC North: MIA, DET, TAMPA, NO, JACS. — Dan McDermott (@NFLDAN) October 3, 2017
Perception: Under Harbaugh, during the regular season, the Ravens are just 32-42 on the road, and since their Super Bowl win in 2012, they are just 11-23 on the road. As Dan McDermott of the NFL Network pointed out, their 11 road wins during that time are against terrible teams.
Why is that, well, I can go back to my previous point. You must establish a run game, especially on the road, to grind it out, take the crowd out of the game, and run the clock… all things the Ravens are not good at going. Now, if 3-and-outs won you a game, we’d be undefeated.
REALITY: The Ravens lead the all-team series with the Oakland Raiders 6-3.
Without Carr #Raiders now listed as 4-point favorites over the #Ravens in Oakland. — Tony Lombardi (@RSRLombardi) October 2, 2017
Perception: The Raiders have won the last two meetings, including a one-point victory last September in Baltimore. But if you are like me, then you remember one meeting specifically against the Raiders… January 2001, when the Ravens went into Oakland as an underdog and tore the Raiders apart, 16-3. That’s the game that Trent Dilfer connected with Shannon Sharpe over the middle for a 96-yard touchdown in the second quarter. I was on the island of Trinidad watching on satellite and I will never forget it.
The Ravens received good news when Carr was named “out” for Sunday’s game. Manuel is a decent back-up who can win them games, but I think the Ravens defense might be able to force some turnovers too. But the Ravens will have to stop Marshawn Lynch, and without Brandon Williams, it will be tough.
Ravens defense rushing yds given up: CIN 77, CLEVE 93, *JAX 166, *PIT 174. *No Brandon Williams (foot). — Morgan Adsit (@MorganAdsit) October 1, 2017
When it comes to the defense, the Raiders rank 22nd in the NFL while the Ravens are 23rd. Offensively, the Raiders are 27th, while Baltimore is 30th. So by looking at those stats, this game might be an ugly one to watch… but we are used to that in Baltimore.
Raiders win 17-13.

Automated farm in England grows barley crop,"(CNN) A farm in the United Kingdom is the first in the world to successfully plant, tend and harvest a crop without a single person ever setting foot in the field, according to researchers and developers involved in the project.
From sowing the seeds to picking the grain, human workers were replaced with automated machines operated from a control room. The project, called Hands Free Hectare, was completed last month with a yield of 4 1/2 tons of barley, according to news releases.
The automated farm was a joint venture by Harper Adams University in Shropshire, England, and Precision Decisions, a farming specialist company in York.
""Previously, people have automated sections of agricultural systems, but funding and interest generally only goes towards one single area,"" said Kit Franklin, an agricultural engineer on the project.
Experts agree that automation technology has been available for some time now, but in recent years its implementation has been accelerated by decreasing costs and changing demographics in the workforce.
An automated tractor worked in the barley field.
""The rising cost of labor is a huge driver in the field of agriculture technology,"" explained Matt Nielsen of Autonomous Solutions, a Utah-based company that converts vehicles from manual to robotic control. ""It makes sense when you compare the cost of technology to the cost of labor.""
Harbinger of what's possible
However, there are limitations still to be assessed. For example, fresh fruits and vegetables are more delicate than sturdy grains and may be more susceptible to bruising in a harvest void of human touch.
There are also social and country-specific considerations. In Japan, for instance, agricultural automation may be a necessity; in India, it could mean unemployment for millions.
""Technically, complete automation is feasible everywhere, but economically and socially it only makes sense in certain situations,"" said David Zilberman, a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley.
Nonetheless, the complete mechanization accomplished in the UK is a harbinger of what's possible in agriculture production, according to experts.
At Hands Free Hectare, agronomists and engineers used customized tractors and drones to cultivate the barley from an area roughly equivalent to two and a half acres.
Drones with multispectral sensors took aerial images of the field, while smaller machines at crop level took samples to assess what fertilizers to apply and where. Live camera feeds were used to detect invasive weeds or disease.
Earlier this year, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization stressed the need for technological innovation to create alternatives to high-input and destructive farming practices -- methods that are unsustainable to meet global food needs, the FAO warned.
Engineer Martin Abell monitors an automated spraying operation from the control room.
""Automation will facilitate a sustainable system,"" said Hands Free Hectare's Franklin. ""Different areas of the field, and possibly even individual plants can be treated separately.""
The success at Hands Free Hectare also demonstrates the economic feasibility of complete automation, researchers say.
The project was funded in part by Innovate UK, a government agency that helps British economic sectors transform from low-tech to high-tech. The whole enterprise cost around $250,000, Innovate UK said in a statement.
""The project itself was incredibly good value for money,"" said Martin Abell, a mechatronics researcher at Precision Decisions. ""This was only possible through the use of open-source software, allowing us to program our vehicles through low-cost drone-based autopilots.""
Skill set shift
Researchers maintain that even machinery produced commercially -- as opposed to the prototypes used at Hands Free Hectare -- would be priced comparatively to traditional agricultural equipment.
""Just as computers used to be expensive, the cost of automation technology is decreasing and won't be a barrier for even small farms,"" explained Michael Boehlje, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University.
Hands Free Hectare says the project is not about putting farmers out of work but instead modernizing their position.
""A change in skill set is inevitable,"" said Abell. ""Roles would transition, enabling the farmers to better use their time managing their farm and crops, opposed to carrying out the seemingly robotic task of driving up and down a field in a straight line.""
By leaving the ""robotic"" jobs to the robots, agriculturalists say farmers could create more efficient work-flows free of burdensome labor.
""A farmer once told me he adopted robotic farming systems so he could have a life,"" recalled Boehlje.
With the success of the summer harvest, Hands Free Hectare plans to continue its research into farming without any human tillage. At the end of October, the team plans to plant a full crop of winter wheat.
But first, they plan to celebrate their success -- by brewing their own beer, made from the spring barley harvested last month."
Ten people charged for Louisiana State University hazing death,"Image copyright Family Handout Image caption Maxwell Gruver died from excessive alcohol consumption, a coroner ruled
Louisiana police have announced arrest warrants for 10 people accused of a role in forcing a university student to drink himself to death last month.
All the suspects are affiliated with the social club that police say 18-year-old Maxwell Gruver was attempting to join when he died.
One Louisiana State University student is charged with negligent homicide and nine others are charged with hazing.
Police believe Gruver died after a fraternity ritual called ""Bible study"".
According to a police affidavit, on the night of 13 September, Gruver had been forced to drink during a Phi Delta Theta initiation each time he incorrectly answered questions about the university's all-male club.
Gruver died of ""acute alcohol intoxication with aspiration"", according to a post-mortem examination by the East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner.
The Georgia-native had a blood alcohol level that was over six times the legal limit for driving.
""Today's arrests underscore that the ramifications of hazing can be devastating,"" said university president F King Alexander on Wednesday.
""Maxwell Gruver's family will mourn his loss for the rest of their lives, and several other students are now facing serious consequences - all due to a series of poor decisions,"" he continued.
One suspect, Matthew Naquin, is charged with negligent homicide, which could carry a five-year prison sentence.
The others face charges of hazing, which carry a 10-30 day jail sentence:
Matthew Alexander Naquin, 19, of Texas
Elliott Eaton, 20, of Louisiana
Patrick Forde, 20, Massachusetts
Sean Paul Gott, 21, of Louisiana
Zachary Hall, 21, of North Carolina
Hudson Kirkpatrick, 19, of Louisiana
Sean Pennison, 21, of Louisiana
Nicholas Taulli, 19, of Texas
Ryan Isto, 18, of Canada
Zachary Castillo
All 10 suspects are affiliated with the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, but two are not currently enrolled at the school.
The charges now go to a grand jury, which will determine if there is enough evidence to warrant a criminal trial.
In September, a judge in Pennsylvania dismissed all the serious charges that had been filed against Pennsylvania State University fraternity members after a student there died during an initiation event."

High Ranking CIA Agent Blows Whistle On The Deep State And Shadow Government,"By Aaron Kesel
A CIA whistleblower, Kevin Shipp, has emerged from the wolves den to expose the deep state and the shadow government which he calls two entirely separate entities.
“The shadow government controls the deep state and manipulates our elected government behind the scenes,” Shipp warned in a recent talk at a Geoengineeringwatch.org conference.
Shipp had a series of slides explaining how the deep state and shadow government functions as well as the horrific crimes they are committing against U.S. citizens.
Some of the revelations the former CIA anti-terrorism counter intelligence officer revealed included that “Google Earth was set up through the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and InQtel.” Indeed he is correct, the CIA and NGA owned the company Google acquired, Keyhole Inc., paying an undisclosed sum for the company to turn its tech into what we now know as Google Earth. Another curious investor in Keyhole Inc. was none other than the venture capital firm In-Q-Tel run by the CIA according to a press release at the time.
Shipp also disclosed that the agency known as the Joint Special Ops Command (JSOC) is the “president’s secret army” which he can use for secret assassinations, overturning governments and things the American people don’t know about.
FBI warrantless searches violate the Fourth Amendment with national security letters, which Shipp noted enables them to walk into your employer’s office and demand all your financial records and if he or she says anything about them being there they can put your supervisor in jail or drop a case against themselves using the “State’s Secret Privilege law.”
“The top of the shadow government is the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency,” Shipp said.
Shipp expressed that the CIA was created through the Council on Foreign relations with no congressional approval, and historically the CFR is also tied into the mainstream media (MSM.) He elaborated that the CIA was the “central node” of the shadow government and controlled all of other 16 intelligence agencies despite the existence of the DNI. The agency also controls defense and intelligence contractors, can manipulate the president and political decisions, has the power to start wars, torture, initiate coups, and commit false flag attacks he said.
As Shipp stated, the CIA was created through executive order by then President Harry Truman by the signing of the National Security Act of
According to Shipp, the deep state is comprised of the military industrial complex, intelligence contractors, defense contractors, MIC lobbyist, Wall St (offshore accounts), Federal Reserve, IMF/World Bank, Treasury, Foreign lobbyists, and Central Banks.
In the shocking, explosive presentation, Shipp went on to express that there are “over 10,000 secret sites in the U.S.” that formed after 9/11. There are “1,291 secret government agencies, 1,931 large private corporations and over 4,800,000 Americans that he knows of who have a secrecy clearance, and 854,000 who have Top Secret clearance, explaining they signed their lives away bound by an agreement.
He also detailed how Congress is owned by the Military Industrial Complex through the Congressional Armed Services Committee (48 senior members of Congress) giving those members money in return for a vote on the spending bill for the military and intelligence budget.
He even touched on what he called the “secret intelligence industrial complex,” which he called the center of the shadow government including the CIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA.
Shipp further stated that around the “secret intelligence industrial complex” you have the big five conglomerate of intelligence contractors – Leidos Holdings, CSRA, CACI, SAIC, and Booz Allen Hamilton. He noted that the work they do is “top secret and unreported.”
The whistleblower remarked that these intelligence contractors are accountable to no one including Congress, echoing the words of Senator Daniel Inouye when he himself blew the whistle on the shadow government during the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987.
At the time Inouye expressed that the “shadow government had its own funding mechanism, shadowy Navy, and Air Force freedom to pursue its own goals free from all checks and balances and free from the law itself.”
Shipp further added that the shadow government and elected government were in the midst of a visible cold war.
So who is Shipp and is he credible as a whistleblower, does he have credentials for the CIA? Aim.org wrote:
Shipp held several high-level positions in the CIA. He was assigned as a protective agent for the Director of Central Intelligence, a counterintelligence investigator, a Counter Terrorism Center officer, a team leader protecting sensitive CIA assets from assassination, a manager of high-risk protective operations, a lead instructor for members of allied governments, an internal staff security investigator, and a polygraph examiner. He was tasked with protecting the CIA from foreign agent penetration and the chief of training for the CIA federal police force. Mr. Shipp functioned as program manager for the Department of State, Diplomatic Security, and Anti Terrorism Assistance global police training program. He is the recipient of two CIA Meritorious Unit Citations, three Exceptional Performance Awards and a Medallion for overseas covert operations. He is the author of From the Company of Shadows–CIA Operations and the War on Terrorism.
Shipp noted he was working with former NSA whistleblower William Binney but didn’t state what the two were working on together. Shipp is highly credible and may just be the highest level whistleblower. This leak is huge. He has been previously mentioned in the New York Times for blowing the whistle on the mistreatment of him and his family when they were put in a mold-contaminated home. He is also mentioned in a WikiLeaks cable during the GiFiles that I was able to dig up. Is this the beginning of whistleblowers coming forward to end the shadow government and deep state? You can watch Shipp’s full explosive presentation below.

Investors boo cinema stocks after 'Blade Runner 2049' underwhelms,"FILE PHOTO: Cast members Ryan Gosling (L) and Harrison Ford (R) attend a photocall for the film ""Blade Runner 2049"" in Paris, France, September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of cinema stocks dropped on Monday after domestic opening weekend ticket sales for science fiction sequel “Blade Runner 2049” fell short of expectations, the latest disappointment following an underwhelming U.S. summer movie season.
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, Regal Entertainment Group and Cinemark Holdings Inc were all down, with price target cuts by Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also weighing on the shares.
Third-quarter domestic box office sales would be lower than previously expected, Pachter said in a report, “as several titles in the summer release slate failed to resonate with moviegoers.”
AMC fell 7.7 percent to $14.02, Regal Entertainment was down 4.4 percent at $16.04 and Cinemark lost 3.53 percent to $36.35.
“Blade Runner 2049” starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford pulled in $33 million in North America, according to Warner Bros.
That compared to an expected range of $45 million to $50 million, despite positive reviews and the popularity of the original 1982 “Blade Runner,” according to a report by Variety.com.
Other recent movies have fallen short of expectations, including “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” and “Baywatch,” in a slow U.S. summer movie season that underscored the trend of more consumers watching entertainment online.
Wedbush’s Pachter cut his price target on AMC to $20.50 from 22.75 and lowered his target for Regal Entertainment to $19 from $23. He cut his target for Cinemark to $42 from $44."

Thirteen people have been killed in a riot at a Mexican jail, authorities in the northern state of Nuevo Leon say.
Eight others were severely injured in the disturbance at Cadereyta prison. Local media report that 250 inmates battled security forces.
A spokesman for the state government said lethal force had been used to regain full control of the facility.
It is the latest in a string of bloody clashes in Mexico's jails, which are often dominated by drugs gangs.
Tensions also rose outside the jail, near Monterrey, as prisoners' friends and relatives clashed with police.

Authorities say an initial fight - reportedly between rival gangs - was quashed on Tuesday morning but violence re-erupted later when prisoners started fires.
Black smoke was seen rising over the facility and helicopters were sent to dampen the flames.
One inmate died in the initial fire.

Can Ravens Bounce Back vs. Rivals?,"Can Ravens Bounce Back vs. Rivals?
(Before It's News)
Perception is Reality
REALITY: The Baltimore Ravens continue to deal with crushing injuries.
Football is won in trenches, & losses of Williams & Yanda are evident. Ravens overall look sluggish. Injuries continue. Give Jags credit too — Sarah Ellison (@sgellison) September 24, 2017
Perception: Brandon Williams did not make the trip to London and he was missed. Corey Grant and Leonard Fournette ran through holes that Williams might have clogged. The Ravens paid Williams this offseason because he is one of the best and they needed him to anchor the D. And how we see what could happen with him not there. But how long will he not be there? The only thing we have heard from Coach John Harbaugh is that it is not a long-term injury. But we heard the same about Breshad Perriman’s his rookie year and we saw how that turned out. Hopefully John learned his lesson on that one.
With games against the Steelers and Raiders on the horizon, Williams will be needed.
Not having Marshal Yanda was killer on Sunday too. Joe Flacco did not have the protection that he needed and it showed.
Brent Urban got injured Sunday and will miss the rest of the season. That puts 17 players on injured reserve, two more players on IR than anyone else in the league, according to ESPN. Our own Brian McFarland reports that the Ravens have 81 players on their Salary Cap (53-man roster, 16 on IR, 10 on practice squad), and that is five more than the next closest team. It’s also more than they had all of last year, and it’s only Week 3.
The question may not be how good can the Ravens be, but will they be able to field a team for a whole season?
REALITY: Flacco threw another interception (two, actually) and now has thrown one in nine straight games.
This morning’ against the #Jaguars, Joe Flacco finished with -1 yards in the air, meaning 29 of his 28 total yards came after the catch — Lorin Cox (@CoxSports1) September 25, 2017
Perception: I have been a big supporter of Joe Flacco. When you look around the league, Flacco stacks up as a Top 10 QB. When you look at the success he has had over his career, you could say that he is a very good quarterback. In 141 games, Flacco is 85-56, has thrown for over 33,000 yards, has 185 touchdowns, but has 121 interceptions. The playoffs are where he has earned his money, going 10-5 with 25 TDs and 10 INTs and most importantly a Super Bowl win and a Super Bowl MVP award.
There are not many QBs in the league that have that kind of resume… but that is in the past. We need to look at now and the future, and right now, Flacco stinks. Since Flacco led the Ravens to a championship in 2012, he has thrown 70 TD and has 61 INTs. That is NOT good.
It doesn’t get much worse for a quarterback then what Flacco did on Sunday morning. 8-for-18 for just 28 yards, no touchdowns, and two INTs. And as Lorin Cox said… those 28 yards were all receivers. Flacco had -1 yards in the air. That is just awful. So awful that you can’t even comprehend that a starting NFL QB did that.
Flacco admitted after the Week 2 win against the Browns that he is not fully healthy. Flacco has been struggling with injuries over the last few seasons, and missed all of training camp and preseason due to back issues, but he wouldn’t even want to use that as an excuse. Those things happen, and if you are on the field, then you are responsible for your play. If you are hurt, then sit and let someone else do it.
Should the Ravens let someone else lead this team while he rests his back? I guess we’ll find out by how he plays Sunday.
REALITY: It’s Steelers Week in Baltimore.
Steelers Week. Enough said. #RavensFlock pic.twitter.com/3LhGqIdktA — Patrick Gleason (@PMGleason) September 26, 2017
Perception: The Ravens were not going undefeated, so it really doesn’t matter if they lost by 37 or 1 – it’s just one game, during a week that saw a lot of things we didn’t predict. Steelers losing to the Bears? Broncos losing to Bills? Jets beating the Dolphins? Raiders losing to Washington?
Teams will have a bad day and it’s time to shake it off and beat up on someone else this week, and that team happens to be our arch-rival.
Pittsburgh leads the all-time series 25-21, but Baltimore has won four of the last five meetings. The Steelers are listed as 2.5-point favorites for this game in Charm City, after both teams lost last week.
The Ravens don’t get blown out often, but when John Harbaugh’s team does, they usually bounce back, as they are 7-2 in games following losses by 20 or more points, according to ESPN. And if you need a little encouragement, the Ravens lost in Houston by 30 points in October 2012, but came back and won the Super Bowl a few months later.
Pittsburgh comes into Baltimore struggling on offense, ranking 21st in the league in yards, while the Ravens are 30th. Defensively, the Ravens were great the first two weeks of the season, but after laying an egg last week, they rank 20th in the league, while the Steelers D is 3rd in yards allowed.
The Ravens need to go back to what they did in Week 1 and Week 2 with a concentration on running the ball effectively. Can they do that without Yanda, and against a strong Steeler defense? If not, Baltimore will have to rely on Flacco to throw it downfield, and that hasn’t worked out so well this year.
But the records, stats, and past performances all get thrown out this week. It’s time to beat someone up and the toughest, most aggressive team will win this game. Let’s hope it’s Baltimore… 23-17.

Superheroes Are Real,"From Yellowstone National Park to the Bitterroot Mountains, Erik Vermaas says, ""Fires are volatile because of us."" One morning last August, he and two fellow jumpers discovered just how surprising danger could be.
It took three days for Vermaas and his crew to get their fire contained. They used chainsaws (to cut down trees that the fire would have otherwise used as fuel) and that Pulaski (to dig into the soil so there would be nothing on the ground for the fire to feed on). Hoses can factor into a jumper crew’s firefighting plan if a blaze is conveniently close to a river. Usually, it’s not—so instead of soaking their fires, smokejumpers starve them to death.
It’s nonstop work over rough terrain, and all the while the smokejumpers have to ensure they don’t let fatigue cloud their situational awareness. Though jumpers tout their safety record, there are still plenty of ways to get hurt in the woods—particularly when those woods are on fire: grizzlies, falling trees, flames that change direction and burn back toward you. When the fire settled down on the evening of the third day, Vermaas and the two other jumpers retired to their campsite. On fires with a bigger crew, rookies will sometimes engage in cooking competitions to see who can make the most back-country gourmet meal featuring the smokejumpers’ No. 1 staple of nutrition—Spam—as the star ingredient. (You’d be surprised: Spam tempura; Spam with a Ritz Cracker crust; Spam with wild huckleberry glaze…) With only three jumpers, though, this particular campsite was a bit more subdued. On their second night in the woods, the jumpers watched as a storm cell passed over them, strobing with lightning. One bolt sounded as though it had struck right above their heads. “Hope that didn’t start a fire,” one of them joked.
The next day, just after sunrise, the jumpers surveyed the perimeter they’d cut around the one-acre blaze and made sure any spot fires were extinguished. Then they began the unglamorous—but crucial—chore of mopping up: crawling on their knees over the blackened, burnt ground, feeling with their bare hands for any remaining spots of heat. “Fire is just dirty, sweaty, shitty work,” Vermaas says. “The fun part is when you're actually on the front and you're chasing, you're racing the fire. That's what we all crave. That's why we're all here.”
At nine that morning, a pilot flying overhead radioed the crew: You guys know you’ve got a fire-start right next to you? One of the other jumpers volunteered to bushwhack up the ridge to check out what was going on. It was slow going; the jumpers had been working in the thick, 20-foot-high brush that made walking a quarter-mile feel more like walking four. When the scout made it to the top of the ridge, he immediately radioed back: Let’s get out of here.
The fire had crowned—that is, started burning in the tops of the trees. The wind was pushing it toward the jumpers, and it was moving fast. In other circumstances, maybe the jumpers would have radioed for a plane to dump a tanker of retardant on the flames to slow things down, but by around 11 a.m., all those little fires had merged into a big one, and the smoke was so thick the helicopters couldn’t see a damn thing. Vermaas and the other jumper waited anxiously for the scout to fight through the brush back to them. The other jumper with Vermaas, a guy with decades of experience, barked into the radio: We do not have a safety zone, and our escape route is threatened. “That means,” Vermaas explains, “you basically are running out of options.”
“I wouldn’t compare us to the Navy SEALs—those guys get shot at—but it’s similar.”
— DAN COTTRELL
Vermaas heard the loud, gunning sound of what he thought was a helicopter; he watched the treetops sway and felt a momentary surge of relief—until he realized that it wasn’t a chopper making that sound, or all that whooshing wind. The danger was the fire itself, ripping its way through the treetops toward them. No plane or rescue vehicle could make it anywhere near them; they’d have to get themselves out of this mess, and fast.
By the time the third crew member showed up, Vermaas says, “it was already fucking go time.” The jumpers ditched their gear—“We made the decision, ‘Fuck the gear, fuck everything, leave it, we're going’”—and made their way through the brush, racing the fire down toward the river. Vermaas tried not to think about what would happen if the fire spotted and caught below them—fire burns fastest uphill, and when it gets going even the most fleet-footed smokejumper doesn’t stand a chance. All three jumpers made it down to a creek and safe haven, but it was close.
Vermaas stood in the creekbed, then watched as the trees swayed with the energy only a fire could create—when wildfires burn hot enough, they can generate their own weather. Half an hour or so more and those flames would’ve burned right over them. Days later, a salvage crew went in to look for the jumpers’ gear. The only remnants they found were metal grills from their jump helmets and six fasteners from their parachutes. Everything else had been reduced to ashes.
“No person should have ever been down there,” Vermaas says. “It was stupid.” Not necessarily because conditions were dangerous but because the traditional tasks of smokejumpers have become increasingly incompatible with forest science in recent decades. When the program first started, smokejumpers were charged with putting out every fire they parachuted into by 10 a.m. the following morning. U.S. Forest Service smokejumpers were an offshoot of World War II-era paratroopers, and so it should be no surprise that early jumpers took a militaristic approach to firefighting. Wildfire was the enemy, and they attacked every stray spark with ferocity. The small fires that mid-century smokejumpers rushed to put out served several important functions, including thinning forests out; when that natural cleansing process doesn’t occur, you end up with overgrown woods and wildfires that burn hotter and bigger. And you end up with three jumpers caught in the middle of it.
“We've only done more harm to the forest by suppressing these fires that are supposed to happen because they're a natural part of the ecosystem,” says Vermaas, who has a degree in forest management and fire science from Oregon State. “Fires are volatile because of us.” He acknowledges that his philosophy of the beneficial ecological role of wildfires does not exactly align with his chosen profession. “I’m a total hypocrite. But they don't pay you to watch them burn.”
“Smokejumping was never meant to be a real job.”
— HARDY BLOEMEKE
As our understanding of fire has evolved, so has the role of smokejumpers. Though they still parachute into some of the nation’s most remote areas, often a lightning-sparked fire in a national park will be allowed to burn itself out naturally. These days, smokejumpers are deployed more strategically, on fires that need to be put out quickly because there are nearby homes, or other resources that need protecting. “I’ve jumped on fires in suburbs, fires right next to highways,” says Cottrell, one of the Missoula smokejumpers.
Hardy Bloemeke, an air attack pilot in West Yellowstone, started jumping when he was 21 and kept going until he reached the mandatory smokejumper retirement age of 56 a few years ago. Back in the day, he said, if there weren’t enough jumpers on base when a fire call came in, dispatchers had a trick: call the bars in town. On Bloemeke’s first fire jump in Yellowstone National Park, National Park Service employees met his crew after its job was done and foisted cases of beer on them. “I can only tell you that because all those guys are dead or retired by now,” Bloemeke says. “Today, that would get you fired.”
Pilot David Crisp (left) and retired smokejumper Hardy Bloemeke, with more than 350 jumps behind him, now staff a plane to help coordinate air attack efforts in the West Yellowstone area.
Smokejumping used to be a job college kids with an appetite for adventure would try for a couple of summers before moving on to do something else. These days, most jumpers are career firefighters, though the seasonal nature of the work means they aren’t entitled to benefits and only get subsidized healthcare for the months they’re working fires. The job also used to not be particularly conducive to family life, but the Missoula base now has day care. “It seems like they’re a lot more professional than we were back then,” Bloemeke says. Not far away, jumper Knute Olson’s bleach-blond twins are toddling around the tarmac. “We had a lot of fun. Probably too much fun. Most of us were single—once somebody started a family, they usually moved on. When people wanted to settle down, they’d go find what we called ‘a real job.’ Smokejumping was never meant to be a real job.”
T
he rookie-induced delay turned out not to be a problem for the West Yellowstone Smokejumpers: “Our jump ops all went really smooth, just like procedure,” says Hill, the jumper-in-charge, when he calls me that night from the campsite. The eight-man crew spent the day cutting fireline into the smoldering timber to stop the half-acre fire from growing. The forecast was for overnight temperatures near freezing, which would likely subdue the smoke and turn the jumpers’ main tasks into staying warm and watching out for bears.
The next few days, the jumpers will wake up and deal with any still-burning logs before crawling through the black on their hands and knees. Once they’re confident the fire is well and truly extinguished, they will load their chainsaws and their Kevlar jumpsuits and candy bar wrappers and those extra pairs of socks they brought with them into their packs and begin the long trek to wherever the nearest road may be. They will have endured five days of being alternately hot, cold and tired; their bellies will be full of Spam, their bodies pushed to the limit. Back at the base, they’ll distract themselves with Razor-scooter races around the tarmac and coin-flip games, snagging whatever entertainment they can as they await the next call from dispatch. In a few weeks, the season will wind down and they’ll head to their offseason jobs on ski patrol or as pilots or teachers or emergency room doctors. But for now, they’re just happy to be exhausted in the woods with a fire smoldering in the distance.
“This,” Hill says, “is the thing we work all summer for: jumping on fires.”"

How these 3 artists are looking past Trump,"Washington (CNN) At a time when racial divisions appear more dire and there is no shortage of bad news in America, thousands of music lovers gathered in a moment of unity and celebration in the nation's capital over the weekend at the fourth annual ""All Things Go Fall Classic"" music festival.
The three-day event, which draws fans of diverse music genres -— from rock and EDM to hip-hop -— included headliners Swedish electronic dance duo Galantis , Atlanta rapper Young Thug and Foster the People , the indie rock band from Los Angeles.
In the wake of the Las Vegas shooting last week, the band did not perform its most popular song, ""Pumped Up Kicks,"" which is about a boy who fantasizes about shooting up his school.

Australian pop star Betty Who performs on day three of the ""All Things Go Fall Classic"" music festival at Union Market in Washington. The event, held from October 6-8, 2017, draws artists from diverse genres.
""'All Things Go' is about connecting music fans through one of a kind live experiences. Our focus is on what's next in music, collaborating with forward-thinking artists from all backgrounds and genres,"" festival co-founder Stephen Vallimarescu told CNN.
In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre that left 58 dead at the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival last week, Foster the People decided not to play their most popular song, ""Pumped Up Kicks"" — a song about a boy named Robert who has dreams of committing a school shooting — at either the Austin City Limits festival or at ""All Things Go.""
""Playing something like 'All Things Go' this weekend in DC, the festival experience for me has changed a little bit, especially on the heels of Vegas and what just happened over there. That hit us really deeply,"" Mark Foster, the band's lead singer, told CNN. ""But, I think that it's more important than ever to get on stage in that setting and to not be afraid,"" he added.
CNN's #GetPolitical caught up with Foster, Chicago rapper SABA and pop star Betty Who — three musicians who are looking beyond the divide and a news cycle dominated by President Donald Trump to lift up their fans and their communities.
Mark Foster on weaponizing joy
Mark Foster, lead singer of Foster the People, is pictured at the CNN Washington bureau ahead of his performance at the ""All Things Go"" festival on Oct. 8, 2017.
Foster the People released their latest album, ""Sacred Hearts Club"" over the summer and Foster said that while watching a tense political situation ""rip families apart, rip friends apart and really just divide us,"" it was important for the band to make ""joyful"" music.
""Walking into the studio making 'Scared Hearts Club,' it was important for us as artists to write a joyful record, but using joy as a weapon because joy is the best weapon against oppression, it's the best weapon against depression,"" Foster said.
""Going into the studio every day writing a song, I would wake up, I'd read the news in the morning and I would get a knot in my stomach because it felt like there would be a tragedy that happened somewhere in the world, there would be a shooting somewhere, there would be a bombing somewhere,"" Foster added.
""In the words of Tom Petty, 'I won't back down,' ... if we don't let fear stop us from what we're doing, then we're winning."" Mark Foster
Foster said that the band's guitarist Sean Cimino had family members at the Route 91 Harvest Festival who ran to take cover when the shooting took place. The band also had friends who ""barely escaped"" the terror attack at the Bataclan theatre in Paris in 2015, which killed at least 130 people.
But Foster said that while entertainers are meant to entertain, an artist has a responsibility to connect people and speak out during trying times.
""I think artists throughout the history of time have always been controversial and have been a voice to speak to public culture in a way that a politician can't because they'll lose their constituency,"" Foster said. ""But artists I think historically, have always shined a magnifying glass on culture and talked to it whether it's helping give people words to sing about or feel something they might not know how to articulate themselves.""
And at a time when concerts around the world have become the target of deadly violence and terror, Foster said that artists should stand strong: ""In the words of Tom Petty, 'I won't back down,' ... if we don't let fear stop us from what we're doing, then we're winning.""
Betty Who's great escape
Betty Who is pictured following her performance at the ""All Things Go"" festival at Union Market in Washington, DC, on Oct. 8, 2017.
Australian pop star Betty Who, whose full name is Jessica Newham, makes music that empowers her fans with messages about self-love and songs that celebrate human connection. Her biggest hits include the upbeat dance jam ""Human Touch"" and her cover of ""I Love You Always Forever"" off her 2017 album, ""The Valley.""
""More than anything, I feel my biggest responsibility is to stay joyful and present in the face of despair,"" Betty told #GetPolitical. ""I think a lot of the communities that come to my shows are really affected by what's going on in the world right now and I think that I would so much rather create an environment where they felt like they could be themselves and where they felt like they could have a really good time even if it is an escape.""
More than anything, I feel my biggest responsibility is to stay joyful and present in the face of despair. Betty Who
The pop singer, who toured with Katy Perry, said that when she first started to sing her mother told her that eventually, she will have to use her platform for something good and pick a cause. But the 26-year-old did not have to look far to find her calling.
Betty said that she grew up in a community where gay rights were respected and ""people married the people they loved because they loved them,"" but it wasn't until she got older that she realized how oppressed many LGBTQ communities are around the world.
She described the first time she performed as Betty Who in New York and her audience was largely a group of 90 gay men and immediately she knew what her message would be.

""I remember playing the first show and saying, 'this is my cause.' I don't have to think about it. I didn't have to search for it,"" Betty said. ""I don't feel like I'm tied to the LGBTQ community, i just feel like they are so many who come to my shows who are a part of that community that I have an opportunity to be a voice for them.""
She added that the more women come to her shows, the more she gets offers to play shows for Planned Parenthood — a mission she is also passionate about.
Betty said that while she feels a ""responsibility"" to speak out, it never feels like a ""burden."" But when she performs, she wants to give her fans a burst of positive energy and a much-needed escape.
""I don't really want to shove it in their faces when they come to a show, I don't want to be like we should talk about politics now,"" she said. ""It's like no, I want you to come to the show and enjoy it. I want you to forget all the horrible stuff that's going on. I want you to be able to let loose and have fun especially in trying times like these.""
SABA and the Chicago 'renaissance'
SABA performs at the ""All Things Go"" festival at Union Market in Washington, DC, on Oct. 7, 2017.
SABA hails from the West Side of Chicago — ""the part of the city that they don't be talkin' about"" — as he raps in ""Westside Bound 3,"" a song off his latest album, ""The Bucket List Project.""
He was featured on Chance the Rapper's 2013 ""Acid Rap"" mixtape and the 2016 hit, ""Angels.""
Everything in me wants to do do good and give back. SABA
""I have always loved creative writing and I think that's why I got into open mics because they were poetry based,"" he told #GetPolitical. ""A lot of the writing that's on 'Bucket List Project' is more so focused on creative writing.""
SABA, whose full name is Tahj Malik Chandler, learned to love music from his father and his work is inspired by two disparate yet equally authentic experiences of Chicago — a city plagued by gun violence and poverty and a city that is bustling with creative energy, art and activism.
His most recent release, ""Where Ideas Sing,"" was inspired by ""the creative renaissance that's happening in Chicago ... just the innovation and me trying to inspire others the way the city inspired me,"" he said.

Other songs like ""Church/Liquor store,"" featuring Noname, touch on the darker side of the city. The song describes SABA's experience going home on a bus in Chicago and lists exactly what he sees along the way — ""funeral home, church, church, liquor store, corner store"" -— taking the listener on a stroll through the impoverished streets.
The 23-year-old rapper lost his cousin John Walt in February after he was shot and killed in Chicago and SABA said that his cousin's death ""got me writing way different.""
He is currently working on the longest song he's written so far, which chronicles his relationship with his cousin, the pain of losing him and how this experience relates to the city of Chicago.
Came to visit @dinnerwithjohn #foreverjohnwalt A post shared by SABA (@sabapivot) on Sep 24, 2017 at 2:39pm PDT
""It started off me rapping about prom because that's how me and my cousin got cool,"" SABA said. ""He asked me who I was talking to prom when I was a senior in high school and I didn't have anybody to take to prom, so he knew some girl and said 'here, you can take her to prom,' and after that me and him were like super close. So it starts off super innocent and then it keeps going.""
SABA is starting a foundation in his cousin's name to help young artists in Chicago pursue their dreams. He said that while you ""can't be mad"" at artists who don't speak out on social issues, ""everything in me wants to do do good and give back."""

Top 75 Asian Innovative Universities Methodology,"To create our ranking of the Asia Pacific region's most innovative universities, Reuters News relied on data compiled by Clarivate Analytics and several of its research platforms: InCites, Web of Science, Derwent Innovations Index, Derwent World Patents Index and Patents Citation Index.
The process began by identifying approximately 150 academic and government Asia-Pacific organizations, a subset of the 600 such organizations globally, that published the greatest number of articles in scholarly journals from 2010 to 2015, as indexed in the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection database. The list was cross-referenced against the number of patents filed by each organization during the same time period in the Derwent World Patents Index and the Derwent Innovations Index. Patent equivalents, citing patents and citing articles were included up to March 2017. The timeframe allows for the articles and patent activity to receive citations, thereby contributing to that portion of the methodology.
The list was reduced to those institutions that filed 50 or more patents, the bulk of which were universities. Each candidate university was then evaluated using various indicators including how often a university’s patent applications were granted, how many patents were filed with global patent offices and local authorities and how often the university's patents were cited by others. Universities were also evaluated in terms of how often their research papers were cited by patents and the percentage of articles that featured a co-author from industry.
Since some university systems centralize their patent administration, it may not be possible to identify which of the various campuses was responsible for the initial research, so in these cases the entire system was ranked, as opposed to an individual campus.
Further complicating matters is the fact that not all universities publicly list their names on their patents or use complex name variants. For example, patents by the University of Oxford are filed under the name ISIS Innovations Ltd. In such instances, the name of the entity administrating patents for a university was identified and the patents then associated with the university by the Clarivate analysts.
The following are the criteria that contributed to the composite score, which in turn determined the ranking of the universities according to innovative capacity and achievement.
Patent Volume
Source: Derwent World Patents Index, Derwent Innovations Index
The number of basic patents (patent families) filed by the organization. This is an indication of research output that has a potential for commercial value. The number is limited only to those patents that are registered with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
Patent Success
Source: Derwent World Patents Index, Derwent Innovations Index
The ratio of patent applications to grants over the assessed timeframe. This indicates the university’s success in filing applications that are then accepted.
Global Patents
Source: Derwent World Patents Index, Derwent Innovations Index
The percentage of patents for which coverage was sought with the U.S., European and Japanese patent offices. Filing an international patent is an expensive and laborious process and filing in multiple countries or regions is an indication that the invention is considered to be nontrivial and has commercial value.
Patent Citations
Source: Patents Citation Index
The total number of times a patent has been cited by other patents. As part of the patent inspection process, the patent office examiner will cite significant prior art. The number of times a patent has been cited is an indication that it has an impact on other commercial R&D.
Patent Citation Impact
Source: Patents Citation Index
This is an indication of how much impact a patent has had. Because it is a ratio (or average), it is not dependent on the size of the organization. Note that the indicator Percent of Patents Cited (listed below) is closely related to this indicator, therefore these two indicators are given half the weighting of all others.
Percent of Patents Cited
Source: Patents Citation Index
This indicator is the proportion of patents that have been cited by other patents one or more times. As mentioned, it is closely tied to the Patent Citation Impact indicator.
Patent to Article Citation Impact
Source: Patents Citation Index, Derwent World Patents Index, Web of Science Core Collection
Similar to Patent Citation Impact, this indicator measures the average number of times a journal article has been cited by patents. This unique indicator demonstrates that basic research conducted in an academic setting (as recorded in scholarly articles) has had influence and impact in the realm of commercial research & development (as measured by patents).
Industry Article Citation Impact
Source: Web of Science Core Collection
Article-to-article citations are an established indicator of influence and research impact. By limiting the citing articles only to those from industry, this indicator reveals the influence and impact that basic research conducted in an academic setting has had on commercial research.
Percent of Industry Collaborative Articles
Source: Web of Science Core Collection
The percentage of all articles of a university that contain one or more co-authors from a commercial entity. This indicator shows the percentage of research activity that is conducted in collaboration with industry, suggesting potential future economic impact of the research project jointly undertaken.
Total Web of Science Core Collection Papers
Source: Web of Science Core Collection
The total number of journal articles published by the organization. This is a size-dependent measure of the research output of the university.
Final Score
The indicators were used to rank each of the universities and the composite score was achieved by summing the ranks for each criterion for each university. Each indicator was weighted equally with the exception of Patent Citation Impact and Percent of Patents Cited, which received 50 percent weighting each since they are closely related in measuring the same phenomenon. If two or more universities tied in their final score, then the number of Patent Citations was used to separate them, since that indicator is closely related to demonstrating the continuing utility of an invention or process."
Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 20 Tight Ends: Does Anyone Want To Emerge As Trustworthy?,"Week 4 Rankings (2017): Top 20 Tight Ends: Does Anyone Want To Emerge As Trustworthy?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
How many tight ends can we truly trust on a weekly basis? Whether it’s due to health issues or simply a lack of production, the position appears to consistently be in flux. It makes having those truly top options that much more valuable, as we cross our fingers and try to predict which tight end is going to produce and which will disappoint. Let’s take a look and see how the rankings currently stand for Week 4:
Rob Gronkowski – New England Patriots – vs. Carolina Zach Ertz – Philadelphia Eagles – at Los Angeles Chargers Travis Kelce – Kansas City Chiefs – vs. Washington Delanie Walker – Tennessee Titans – at Houston Jimmy Graham – Seattle Seahawks – vs. Indianapolis Jason Witten – Dallas Cowboys – vs. Los Angeles Rams Eric Ebron – Detroit Lions – at Minnesota Jordan Reed – Washington Redskins – at Kansas City Cameron Brate – Tampa Bay Buccaneers – vs. New York Giants Jack Doyle – Indianapolis Colts – at Seattle Kyle Rudolph – Minnesota Vikings – vs. Detroit Jared Cook – Oakland Raiders – at Denver Evan Engram – New York Giants – at Tampa Bay Charles Clay – Buffalo Bills – at Atlanta Martellus Bennett – Green Bay Packers – vs. Chicago Jesse James – Pittsburgh Steelers – at Baltimore Benjamin Watson – Baltimore Ravens – vs. Pittsburgh Coby Fleener – New Orleans Saints – at Miami Julius Thomas – Miami Dolphins – vs. New Orleans Hunter Henry – Los Angeles Chargers – vs. Philadelphia
Thoughts:
Zach Ertz has been targeted at least 8 times in each of the first three games, including 10 targets in each of the past two. We’ve long been waiting for the breakout to come, and finally we’re seeing it. He has 21 receptions for 245 yards and 1 TD and it’s only a matter of time before he finds the end zone a few more times. He’s going to be one of the elite each and every week.
The New York Giants have allowed 23 receptions and 3 TD to opposing tight ends over the first three weeks of the season. While Cameron Brate hasn’t done much thus far this season, this could be the week that he finally puts up some strong numbers. Consider him a viable TE1 in all formats.
After struggling over the first two weeks Jimmy Graham was one of the biggest benefactors of Russell Wilson’s breakout performance turning 11 targets into 7 receptions and 72 yards. With Doug Baldwin banged up there’s a good chance Graham posts another strong day.
The Baltimore Ravens watched Mercedes Lewis score three TD in Week 3, and we know Jesse James has the potential to find the end zone (2 TD in Week 1). It seems like the perfect opportunity for a sleeper to emerge, though he’s still a pretty big risk. Consider him high risk, but high reward.

They were wearing some very creepy, strange masks.
 
As the two got closer, the group of kids could see that they were both armed.
 
The two continued to stalk the group of kids. Whether it was a sick joke or a real couple of psychos, is still unclear.

Using the New iPad Apps Dock,"Photo
Q. I just upgraded my iPad to iOS 11, and while I liked dragging my favorites into the little bar of apps across the bottom of the screen, the bar itself doesn’t stay there consistently. Why?
A. The new “dock” in Apple’s latest version of its mobile software is similar to the tool bar that has been a part of its Mac operating system for years. Like the desktop version, the iOS 11 dock is designed to hide when you do not need it. The auto-hide behavior in macOS is optional and can be changed in the System Preferences, but the iOS 11 dock is designed to disappear to minimize screen clutter when you open an app on the iPad.

However, if you want the dock back because you want to open (or switch to) another app without having to press the iPad’s home button to go back to the Home screen, just swipe up from the bottom of the screen to make the dock reappear. You can then tap an app in the dock to open that program.
To switch between other running apps, drag your finger up from the bottom of the screen when the dock is showing. You then see small preview windows of open apps and the iOS 11 Control Center, a panel of icons that serve as shortcuts to common system settings. Swipe the screen to the left or the right to see all the open app windows. (You can also double-click the home button to see this “app-switcher” screen.)
You can switch to another app by tapping its preview window. And, if an app is frozen or misbehaving, you can force it to close by dragging its preview window off the top of the screen."

Search ends for bodies in Mexico City after earthquake,"Wreaths hang on a building that collapsed in an earthquake, after rescue teams retrieved the last body trapped in the rubble on Wednesday, in Mexico City, Mexico October 4, 2017. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The search for victims of an earthquake that killed hundreds in Mexico City ended on Wednesday as rescue workers recovered the body of the last person known to be missing beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Deputy Interior Minister Roberto Campa said all the bodies had been recovered from the ruins of an office building in the upscale Roma district of the capital. The search at other buildings that collapsed ended several days ago.
In total 369 people died in the Sept. 19 earthquake, the most deadly in a generation, with almost two-thirds of the fatalities in the capital. Earlier that month, 98 people died when an even more powerful tremor hit the south of the country.

The “Magic Tricks” Science Information Performs,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
Have you ever seen new or updated scientific information published on the Internet and then try to find it again, only to realize it’s disappeared or probably been “sanitized” from the net?
The above happens quite often from what I know and have experienced personally, being a researcher/journalist. At first when I would report those findings to colleagues, they thought I was imagining things. However, more and more colleagues and friends now are complaining about the “magic tricks” happening online to science information. What’s the reason?
There’s only one apparent answer, in my opinion, and it is censorship, i.e., keeping derogatory and impugning scientific information from common knowledge and, more importantly, being used against corporations and the “consensus science club(s)” that now run the world (really!) in just about every aspect of our daily lives. Check out weather geoengineering and genetic engineering for starters.
Einstein, Edison, Faraday, Newton, Galileo, Archimedes and other prominent real science pioneers must be turning over in their graves or, at least wondering in the hereafter, how the suppression of FACTUAL science was allowed to come about. I bet Copernicus is totally ‘gassed’ that the same scientific BS still goes on. However, now it’s not the Church, which knew absolutely nothing about the ‘astrophysics’ of that time, but currently it’s at the behest of vested interests commonly calling themselves “consensus science.”
Vaccinology and microwave technology are two of the most prominent “consensus sciences” we are forced to live with today, in my opinion.
All the above being considered, we now learn someone has taken notice and done something about preventing science from doing disappearing “magic tricks.” The State of California passed legislation – Senate Bill 51, the Whistleblower and Public Data Protection Act – which “directs California agencies to protect scientific data.” [1]
Furthermore,
The Union of Concerned Scientists — which published a scathing report in July that found the Trump administration had undermined the role of science in public policy, altered scientific content on websites and created a hostile environment for federal scientists — backed the bill. “Science is the foundation of a strong democracy,” said Jason Barbose, Western states policy manager for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “That’s why it is important to protect scientists and their research. SB 51 takes concrete steps to protect federal scientists and scientific data from the Trump administration’s efforts to sideline it from important policy decisions that affect our health and communities.” [1]
Oh, California! You don’t know what you just did by passing such legislation. Now you legally have to publish and confirm all the REAL science regarding vaccines, so-called ‘immunizations’, and the pseudo-science about aluminum and ethylmercury non-impacts upon human biochemistry and neurology—but more than anything—the suppressed information about vaccine adverse effects not being given to prospective vaccinees, parents and children’s guardians.
California, you cannot hold medical and ‘vaccinology science’ up to a double standard such as spewed forth by Senator Pan, the sponsor of the infamous SB 277 [2]. That unscientifically-based legislation now has to be rescinded due to the importance California now believes, mandates and enforces by legislation that real science information should not be removed from public accessibility.
When will the California Department of Public Health publish the real science about mandatory vaccines?
Come on now, you can’t wiggle your way out of this one! Californians now have the law on their side to demand the true, factual, real scientific facts about the suppressed adverse health effects of all vaccines, plus what genetically-modified vaccine ingredients do in human biochemistry.

"Battered by the Dodgers, Diamondbacks Turn to Plan Z - Zack Greinke","That Greinke stands in the Dodgers’ path to a second straight appearance in the National League championship series is a story line with a nice Hollywood twist. The last time Greinke appeared in the postseason, he was a Dodger, losing in Game 5 of a 2015 division series against the Mets. Six of his teammates in that game also graced the Los Angeles starting lineup in the first two games of this series.
After the 2015 season, Greinke, who won the American League Cy Young Award in 2009, opted out of the final three years of his Dodgers contract to sign with the Diamondbacks. He was lured to Arizona by a six-year, $206.5 million deal — which is one of the most lucrative in baseball and also has the highest annual value of any contract in the sport.
In dashing toward that canopy of cash, Greinke, intentionally or not, was also moving away from the human sun shade that is Clayton Kershaw. As teammates they were good friends, but Greinke was always going to be known as the other Cy Young winner in that rotation.
In 2006, Greinke had considered retiring from baseball after he was found to have social anxiety disorder and depression. He didn’t retire, a lot of success followed — including four All-Star Game appearances — and now in the Valley of the Sun he has added to his accomplishments, although without the glare of Los Angeles (consider that three of his home wins this season, including one on Aug. 31 against the Dodgers, were in front of crowds of fewer than 20,000).
Photo
The local fans didn’t turn Greinke into a public piñata in 2016 when a torn left oblique muscle limited him to 26 games, even though as Greinke went, so went the Diamondbacks. They finished with 93 losses that season, a pretty poor initial return on the franchise’s $34-million-a-year investment in their ace.
This year, a healthy Greinke went 17-7 with a 3.20 E.R.A., and the Diamondbacks flipped their 2016 record, winning 93 games.
Against the Dodgers, Greinke was 1-2 this season with a 3.65 earned run average. But in his last two starts against his former team, he was credited with the win after pitching six innings in an 8-1 victory, and then he absorbed a no-decision during a seven-inning outing in an eventual 3-1 Arizona victory.

View all New York Times newsletters.
This is Greinke’s fifth division series, and he also has been in the N.L.C.S. twice. All of that experience could act as a calming influence on teammates like Jimmie Sherfy, who allowed three runs without recording an out on Saturday, or Ketel Marte, who made a fielding error that led to an unearned run.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Diamondbacks’ lineup has provided little support as well, stranding too many base runners and lacking any hitters as footloose and fret-free as the Dodgers’ tongue-flapping, bat-flipping Yasiel Puig.
Like Roger Federer when he is serving, Greinke has a delivery that does not telegraph the type or location of his pitches, which is why he is one of the best at baiting hitters into swinging at balls outside the strike zone. On Monday he will go up against a disciplined Dodger team that is collectively disinclined to chase pitches outside the strike zone. Something will have to give.
At the start of the season, Greinke’s meticulous preparation earned him the nickname Casper, because, as his teammates explained to Fox Sports Arizona’s Diamondbacks broadcasting crew, he is prone to disappearing into some back room to study opponents’ hitting tendencies.
On Saturday, Greinke declined to talk about his upcoming start. He said he would save all questions for his scheduled news conference during the Diamondbacks’ practice on Sunday in Phoenix. But before his wild-card start, he explained his approach to must-win games.
“I just focus on what you do getting ready and do your normal scouting report and just try to make good pitches,” he said. “And hopefully, the results work out good, but you can’t guarantee that.”
No, but he will be on the mound in Game 3, trying to invigorate this series before it is too late."
Exclusive: Russian-linked group sold merchandise online,"""Young, gifted and black."" ""Melanin and muscles."" ""Our sons matter."" The slogans on the clothing that a group called ""Blacktivist"" offered for sale through Facebook were supposed to look like they came from American Black Lives Matter activists. But they were in fact being promoted by a Russian-linked group working to amplify political discord in the U.S. before the presidential election.
CNN first reported last week that ""Blacktivist"" accounts on Facebook and Twitter had regularly shared content intended to stoke outrage in an apparent attempt to amplify racial tensions during the U.S. presidential election. The accounts have been suspended and are among those handed over to Congress as part of its investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
The page appears to have sold fewer than 100 items of Blacktivist-branded merchandise, but the actual amount of clothing sold is less significant than what the effort represented: A move by the people behind Blacktivist to go beyond social media and spread their influence into the physical world. The Blacktivist Facebook page also promoted at least seven rallies and demonstrations around the U.S. in 2016.
Related: Exclusive: Fake black activist accounts linked to Russian government
Jonathon Morgan, the founder of New Knowledge, a company that tracks the spread of misinformation online, says the promotion of events and the sale of merchandise is straight out of the Russian misinformation handbook, and that it ""fits a pattern of Russian propagandists' attempts at appearing as authentic Americans participating in politics.""
""The Russian objective the entire time has been to pit Americans against each other and to prey on divisions that already exist and to capitalize on the hyper-partisan environment that already exists in the US,"" Morgan said.
""It's one thing to get people arguing with each other on the internet but if you can get Americans marching in the streets that escalates conflict and further destabilizes the country.""
Users on Blacktivist's Facebook page who clicked to buy one of the products there would have been taken to a website called Represent, which allows users to upload designs and place them on items like t-shirts and sweatshirts. Merchandise is only produced after an order is placed. Represent handles the payment for and production and shipping of each item and takes a cut on each sale.
Represent pays sellers their cut through PayPal. Asked by CNN about Blacktivist, PayPal had no immediate comment.
The Blacktivist store on Represent, which CNN found while reviewing a cached version of the Blacktivist Facebook page, featured 84 items of clothing. It is not possible to say for certain whether the Russian group behind the Blacktivist Facebook and Twitter accounts started the Represent page, or whether it took advantage of someone else's work, but the Represent page appears to have been started after the Facebook and Twitter accounts, and the branding is consistent across the accounts. Many of the designs that were on offer appear to have been lifted from pre-existing designs, a practice seemingly not uncommon among some sellers of apparel online.
The Blacktivist store on Represent was taken down on Tuesday after CNN contacted the company. Represent would not say if it had been contacted by federal authorities investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election.
Every product on Represent's website includes an ""items sold"" count. Eighty-seven items were sold through the Blacktivist store, a CNN analysis of Represent's website found.
In a statement provided to CNN on Tuesday, Represent did not indicate whether it would inform customers who purchased apparel from the Blacktivist store that the group may have had ties to Russia. ""The campaign has now ended, but if any customers would like a refund, we'd be happy to provide one,"" the company's statement said.
Like Blacktivist's accounts, which went undetected by Facebook and Twitter for months, the store on Represent did not arouse suspicion. ""Our guidelines prohibit illegal or offensive content, but nothing in this campaign appears to have violated those guidelines,"" Represent said in a statement.
Blacktivist publicized its merchandise on its Facebook page using a feature Facebook calls a ""shop section,"" cached versions of the now suspended page show.

Facebook offers two ways for page owners to sell products. With the first option, Facebook acts as the e-commerce platform, and users buy the product on Facebook. The second option, which Blacktivist used, allows users to view products on Facebook, then takes them to another site to check out. Any user who clicked to buy an item on the Blacktivist Facebook page would have been taken to the Represent store.
Facebook does not take a cut of sales generated through this feature, the social network says. It also says products added to shop sections are reviewed to ensure they comply with company policy.
Represent did not confirm if any of the Blacktivist store's 87 sales were the result of Facebook users using this functionality.
Facebook would not comment on the Blacktivist page, and pointed to its chief security officer's statement on September 6 that announced some of the company's findings from its investigation into Russian meddling on its platform. The statement did not mention any merchandise sold.

By Donn Marten -
Nowhere does the loony left show their incredible ignorance than in their comparisons of President Donald Trump to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Anyone who has an inkling of history understands that there is absolutely no comparison to a legitimately elected president of a country in which even the most radical elements such as Antifa and Black Lives Matter are still allowed to have free speech and political opponents aren’t targeted for internment and murder.
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
None of these morons have ever bothered reading William L. Shirer’s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or any other fact-based accounts on the Nazi regime – to many on the left, books are useless unless they require crayons. Godwin’s Law – the rule that the first person invoking the Nazis immediately loses an argument – has been completely trampled by the angry and dangerous mouth-breathers who can’t accept the results of the election but the longer that they continue invoking Der Führer as a way to trash Trump, the more asinine that they look.
It’s now gotten to the point where the Hitler analogies that were effective only months ago are now backfiring as the sheer ridiculousness of it all is starting to create blowback on Hillary’s hate brigades.
For example, the genius in Chico, California who mistakenly believed that a Trump as Hitler billboard would be a great way to promote the Rouse and Revolt recycled clothing store.
The sign lasted less than 24 hours due to intense backlash and the business itself probably will soon follow it out of existence.

Blackhawks at Detroit - 4-2 Win Recap,"Blackhawks at Detroit – 4-2 Win Recap
(Before It's News)
“First Game at Little Caesars Arena”
As we inch closer to the regular season, we saw a nice win for the Blackhawks in the preseason. In their second to last game of the preseason, we saw them play a young Detroit team missing many of their big-name players. The Blackhawks were also missing key players like Kane, Saad, Seabrook, Keith, and Crawford. In their first appearance at Little Caesars Arena the Red Wings new facility, the ‘Hawks won 4-2.
The first period started a little slow and with some sloppy plays, but things would start to get better pretty quick. At 4:54 we saw the first of 10 penalties in the game when Red Wing Robbie Russo slashed Gustav Forsling. The power play was just ok early on but got better in the later periods of the game. Shortly after at 8:23 we would see the first of the Blackhawks penalty kill unit because of a Laurent Dauphin tripping penalty. On the PP, the Red Wings had what looked like a sure goal when Ben Street shot at a sprawling Anton Forsberg. With a wide-open net, the shot went high and hit the crossbar. Later, The Blackhawks would go on the penalty kill 2 more times after a David Kampf interference call and a Tomas Jurco slashing call.
The second period started with the Red Wings on the power play, where they scored the first goal of the game. Justin Abdelkader had the puck down down low, and passed to Niklas Kronwall at the blue line. Kronwall would let a shot go that Red Wings rookie Michael Rasmussen nicely redirected past Anton Forsberg. The period went on seeing a couple good shifts from the makeshift second line of Artem Anisimov, John Hayden, and Vinnie Hinostroza. We saw Anisimov put the puck through a defenders legs to a stuff attempt, and John Hayden have a good shot attempt which resulted in Artem Anisimov getting robbed on the rebound, with a wide-open net. No scoring would come till late in the period.
At 13:50 Richard Panik got the Blackhawks on the board and tied the game. Alex DeBrincat held the puck at the line and tapped it to an open Jonathan Toews, who would make a great cross-ice pass to a wide open Richard Panik. Panik sent a one-timer past Petr Mrazek. The Wings would take the lead back about two minutes later when Libor Sulak put a shot past a sliding Connor Murphy to the glove side of Forsberg.
The third period is where the Blackhawks hit their stride. At the 1:41 mark of the third period, Tanner Kero chipped a pass to a streaking Vince Hinostroza, who weaved through two defenders. Hinostroza then sent a slick backhand pass to Tommy Wingels on the back door, who put a well placed one-timer past Petr Mrazek. Next, the highly anticipated Alex DeBrincat would score his second preseason goal on the power play, as the Wings’ Sulak was given a two-minute minor for hooking against Laurent Dauphin. After taking a pass from Gustav Forsling, DeBrincat then made a nice backhanded pass to defenseman Cody Franson. Franson looked to pass the puck to Jonathan Toews but the pass went all the way through the crease to back to DeBrincat, who let go a nice wrist shot over Mrazek. The Red Wings would challenge the goal for offsides but failed resulting in the ‘Hawks going on another power play. For those unaware, new this year, a failed off-sides challenge results in a two-minute minor for delay of game, instead of just losing a time-out. The final goal of the game would come at 18:35 when Laurent Dauphin made a nice steal at center ice and backhand the puck into the empty net.
The Good
Alex DeBrincat- The kid is looking more confident with the puck and is usually in the right position at the right time. While still getting pushed around a bit, it seems DeBrincat is learning how to win his battles. Two points on the night
Artem Anisimov – While not finding the score sheet Anisimov proved his worth with a few good shot attempts and his line created some good chances.
The Penalty Kill – The ‘Hawks would go five for six on the PK. They seem more aggressive and have better cycling better than we saw last season, so far.
John Hayden – Hayden very well may play himself into a roster spot. While not scoring in this game, he would end up with three hits and 2 shots on net. The more Hayden plays, the more he shows his skill, speed, and physicality. He also seems to cause a little disruption when he is on the ice, almost starting another fight in front of the goal.
Vinnie Hinostroza – While I don’t know if he will make the opening night roster, watching Vinnie was fun tonight. As we know Hinostroza is fast, he is really starting to show the offensive upside. He is starting to make more smart plays and is also seeing the plays much better.
Anton Forsberg – Forsberg would have another good night in goal, saving 32 of 34 shots. As of now expect Forsberg to be the backup. The Bad Power Play – Not horrible but the ‘Hawks went one for four on the power play. Seeing a couple more shots and some more zone time would be nice, but they were also missing some major pieces on the power play. The Ugly Tomas Jurco – Yet again another game where he was invisible. Other than occasionally touching the puck Jurco had zero shots on goal, one hit, and a giveaway. Can we please get rid of this failed experiment.

Colin Kaepernick: From one man kneeling to a movement dividing a country,"Colin Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since March when he opted out of his San Francisco 49ers contract
""This is what lynchings look like in 2016.""
A video accompanies Colin Kaepernick's Instagram post. It begins as two white police officers wrestle a black man to the floor.
One officer appears to cuff the man's hands behind his back. Another, positioned by the man's shoulders, tightly presses his head to the ground.
The same officer moves one hand away, reaching for his gun. He points it to the man's chest, and fires.
Alton Sterling, 37, died of gunshot wounds to the chest and back.
Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first protested against racial injustice and police brutality by kneeling down during the United States national anthem in the summer of 2016. Since then, a whole movement has grown around that gesture.
BBC Sport's Richard Conway, David Lockwood and Simon Clancy travelled to the US to investigate. Listen again to BBC Radio 5 live's programme, On Bended Knee, and watch a special Newsnight report.
""Another murder in the streets because of the colour of a man's skin, at the hands of the people who they say will protect us,"" Kaepernick writes.
""When will they be held accountable?""
The next day, 6 July 2016, another black man is shot dead by a police officer.
Philando Castile, 32, is shot seven times during a traffic stop. He died in the driver's seat with his girlfriend beside him and her four-year-old daughter in the back.
Police dashcam footage shows officer Jeronimo Yanez firing several times into the car. He pulled it over because of a broken brake light.
Media playback is not supported on this device Police dashcam has been released of the Philando Castile shooting
The microphone on Yanez's uniform picks up this exchange:
Yanez: ""You have a licence and insurance?""
[pause]
Castile: ""Sir, I do have to tell you I have a firearm on me.""
Yanez: ""OK, OK. Don't reach for it then. Don't pull it out.""
Castile: ""I'm not pulling it out.""
Yanez: ""Don't pull it out.""
After the shots were fired, Castile's girlfriend Diamond Reynolds took out her mobile phone and livestreamed from inside the car as the officer screamed for her not to move.
""Please don't tell me my boyfriend just went like that,"" she says.
""Please officer don't tell me you just did this to him. You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his licence.""
Reynolds is handcuffed and held in the back of a police car with her daughter, who says: ""Please stop cussing because I don't want you to get shooted. I can keep you safe.""

A black former member of the US Army Reserve kills five police officers as a Black Lives Matter march is held in Dallas. The march was organised to protest against the shootings of the previous two days.
Micah Johnson, 25, is himself killed following a stand-off with police, who sent remotely detonated explosives into the car park where he had taken refuge.
The city's police chief David Brown reveals Johnson told a negotiator he had wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, because he was angry about the recent shootings of black men by police.
He is said to have shouted: ""How many did I get?""

'A very deep thinker'
The tattoo across his chest reads: ""Against all odds.""
Kaepernick was adopted, a mixed-race baby raised by a white family. The Kaepernicks had two young sons who died because of heart defects. They wanted another child.
Their boy grew up to become a superstar, and one of the most divisive figures in the United States.
At high school he was a brilliant baseball pitcher, but the NFL was his focus. He could throw the ball. A quarterback.
Kaepernick posted this photo with his mum Teresa with the caption: ""She showed me how my heart was supposed to radiate! Love you!""
First, he had to reach the college game. It wasn't easy. Scouts from the University of Nevada - the only one to eventually offer him a scholarship - watched the clips his older brother had burned to DVD, but even they were not convinced.
They took a gamble because they saw him dominate a high-school basketball game he really should have missed, having been struck down with fever the same day.
He went to college. He studied for a degree in business management, excelled on the pitch, and opened his curious mind wide to the world.
Dr Reginald Stewart spent 19 years at the University of Nevada, and knew Kaepernick during his time there.
He told USA Today: ""He is very, very smart and very intellectual. He's a very deep thinker. What he's doing is absolutely and directly in line with how he's always communicated.
""It's not like I turned on the TV and was like: 'Wow, where did this come from?' I was like, you know what, he has been thinking about these issues for at least the time I've known him. At some point, he made the decision that this was important enough for him to act.""
Kaepernick is drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in 2011. He leads them to the Super Bowl two years later, but they lose to the Baltimore Ravens.
He continues to read widely - about the civil rights movement and post-colonial theory, Malcom X's autobiography and Franz Fanon's The Wretched Of The Earth.
He begins to attend classes at the University of California, Berkeley, having befriended Ameer Hasan Loggins, who is working towards his doctorate in African Diaspora Studies.
In August, Loggins wrote an article for The Athletic about their relationship. He compared Kaepernick to Ella Baker, the civil rights activist who died in 1986, aged 83.
""She was a civil/human rights leader that was invested in developing a leaderful movement,"" Loggins wrote. ""She pushed the folks to politicise and mobilise the people via group-centred leadership.
""Here I am, taking leadership cues from Ella Baker, and next thing I know I am in the inner circle of a passionate, intelligent and conscious NFL star with a tremendous heart and a righteous indignation over the treatment of the oppressed.
""I met Kaepernick before he became a cultural icon and a lightning rod for both hope and hatred.
""People that trace our connection to UC Berkeley assume he became politicised in my class. But Colin was aware, focused, well-read, eager to learn.""
And then came three days in July last year.
The perilous fight
The singer pauses, hanging between verses. He knows - like the thousands standing around him in the stands, on the pitch and on the stage - that the Star-Spangled Banner, the American national anthem, is about to reach its highest point.
Kaepernick is on the team bench. Sandwiched between two giant soft-drink barrels, he sits alone as thousands roar and whoop in appreciation.
""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,"" he says after the pre-season match in August 2016.
""There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.""
Kaepernick, with his shirt number slightly obscured, is by the orange drinks cart
This is not his first protest. But it is his first protest in team kit. And it is the first time he is asked about it.
His silent, solitary gesture of solidarity makes a lot of people very angry. One of those is Nate Boyer. He used to be in the US Army Special Forces and is a former NFL player.
""When I saw that, I felt like I was betrayed. It just hurt. It was extremely disgraceful for me. In my eyes you might as well burn the flag,"" he told the BBC.
""That was my initial reaction before I stopped and thought: 'What is he so upset about that he would want to protest the symbol of what our country stands for - which is freedom of rights?'""
Boyer decides to write an open letter to Kaepernick. And they meet.

The NFL star - in 2014 he signed a contract that would have been worth up to $126m (£95.8m) over six years - actually sends a taxi to take Boyer from San Diego to San Francisco, about an eight-hour drive along the California coast.
""I wanted him to stand - but I wanted him to stand because he feels like we are going in the right direction, like things are changing,"" Boyer says of their meeting.
""I wanted him to understand the implications of what he was doing, and he listened. That was important, because we are at a time when people just shake their fists instead of trying to fix something together. We reached a position of consensus.""
A week later, Kaepernick protests again. This time he is joined by his team-mate Eric Reid, and both men kneel while the national anthem plays.

Boyer stands next to them. On the same night, at another match, Jeremy Lane of the Seattle Seahawks remains seated for the anthem. The movement is growing.
""It took courage for him to sit initially. It took more courage to bend his position a little bit,"" Boyer adds.
""I told him if they knelt I would be next to them with my hand on my heart, because I support your right to peacefully protest in this country. That is what I fought for.""
'I guess that makes me a proud bitch!'
Media playback is not supported on this device Mr Trump attacked dissenting players at a rally in Alabama
In late September, two matches in to the 2017 NFL season, President Donald Trump makes a speech.
He says players who refuse to stand for the national anthem are ""sons of bitches"" who should be fired by their teams.
The reaction to his words could not be more divided.
There is support from many - who find the protest disrespectful - and there is condemnation from many others.
Kaepernick's mother tweets: ""I guess that makes me a proud bitch!""
NBA star LeBron James describes Trump as a ""bum"".
Over the weekend of 24-25 September, never before had the protest of refusing to stand during the national anthem attracted such attention. Scores of athletes, managers and coaches - across several sports - performed some kind of protest or gesture of solidarity while the national anthem played before their games.
Some linked arms, some stayed in the dressing room, many knelt. Travis Kelce of Kansas City Chiefs became the most prominent white player to kneel.
""I will be proud of it until the day I die,"" he told BBC Sport.
""Hopefully it creates talk and creates change. It's very important for this to actually become a change in society instead of it just being a badge on NFL players for making a protest.""
But players find themselves having to explain what their actions mean.
Many NFL supporters and the US public in general view the players as being unpatriotic, disrespectful of American values and/or the US military, and they agree with what Trump said.
Media playback is not supported on this device Chiefs fans divided over players kneeling
Outside the stadiums, fans tell the BBC:
""I'm 100% against it and 100% behind Trump. I don't come out to the football games to see political views. This is not the venue for the protest. I will boo them.""
""They need to respect the flag.""
""The message was never about the anthem, the message is about police brutality against African-Americans and that seems to have been lost.""
Eric Reid, who first kneeled with Kaepernick a year before, writes in the New York Times: ""It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel. We chose it because it's exactly the opposite.
""It has always been my understanding that the brave men and women who fought and died for our country did so to ensure that we could live in a fair and free society, which includes the right to speak out in protest.""
But Kaepernick himself is absent. Why?
'A prisoner of the moment'
Two NFL players walk into a computer game shop. It's not a joke, this really happened:
Keith Marshall and Rob Kelley of the Washington Redskins were in Dulles, just outside the nation's capital, when they saw a young boy wearing Kaepernick's number seven San Francisco 49ers jersey. They complimented him on it.
In conversation, the 10-year-old Jaden explains why he is there. He has been saving up for an Xbox, and is keeping tabs on the price - he can't yet afford it.
So they buy it for him - with his grandma's permission of course.
Jaden explains why he has a Kaepernick jersey.
""I liked how he wasn't afraid to show what he thought. He risked getting fired, which was a big thing. I wouldn't even do that, but he did, and I really like him for standing out.
""I don't know if people agree with it, but he just doesn't care what people say and that's inspired me and probably inspired other people.""
Marshall and Kelley also bought Jaden a game - but it wasn't Madden, the official NFL computer game.
Had it been, Jaden would not have found his favourite player. Kaepernick is no longer in the game. In March, he opted out of his contract with the 49ers. He is now 29 years old and a free agent. But off the pitch, he is busy.
""His family is probably able to do whatever they want, but not everybody is able to have the stuff that we have the luxury of having,"" said Kelley (right)
He has been donating money to various charities and projects across the United States - he has pledged to donate $1m (£750,000) in total - and has helped set up an educational campaign called Know Your Rights.
In late September, Sports Illustrated published a front cover on how sport has united following Trump's speech.
There was no Kaepernick there either.
He is not injured, and should still be capable of performing at the highest level. He has not spoken to the media for months. There are reports that team owners are refusing to sign him - despite coaches wanting to.
NBA star Steph Curry was featured on the cover, after he said he would not accept an invitation to the White House. Trump later said Curry had been 'uninvited'.
Colin Kaepernick was not featured on the front of this month's Sports Illustrated magazine
When he was asked about Kaepernick's omission from the Sports Illustrated front cover, Curry described him as ""a prisoner of the moment"".
""That was terrible,"" he said. ""The real people who are understanding exactly what's going on and who's really been active and vocal and truly making a difference, if you don't have Kaepernick front and centre on that, something's wrong.""
Boyer, who was there when Kaepernick 'took a knee' for the first time, has not spoken to him for a while either - not since the Super Bowl, in February.
He says that ""there was never any falling out as such"", but he does worry about him ""being pulled so far in one direction that there is never going to be any room to grow and really move forward"".
He believes Kaepernick ""may never play again"" but adds: ""I don't fear that, because he is in a much more important position now.
""If he is able to embrace those who disagree with him and love them, much like Martin Luther King did, then Colin has the potential to be something like that.
""He could be the face of something and really move this conversation forward - if he is willing to listen.
""It is going to take swallowing of pride and humility, but I would rather see him move into this realm than play again, because he has been quiet for a long time.
""We need you to be a part of this because you started this.""

It is a small agricultural town, inland from the opulent coastal resort of Palm Beach, where Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence is situated.

On Friday night, 17-year-old Kortney Ware was among the Glades Central Raiders lining up to face a team from Lake Worth, down on the coast. They won 50-8. Before the match, as the anthem played, Ware took a knee.
""I did it for the police brutality,"" he told BBC Sport's Richard Conway.
""People have got to speak up. I am tired of seeing us black people killed, especially young people. Every day somebody black getting killed for little stuff. It's tough for us black people. So we're standing up.""
Some schools in the United States have vowed to punish players who refuse to stand for the national anthem.
And on Tuesday, reports suggested NFL owners, at a league meeting next week, are planning to introduce rules to force players to stand.
The Raiders' coach, Jessie Hester, himself a former NFL player, says he ""fully supports"" the protests, and his players' right to do the same.

""There is social injustice in this country that we need to address and the guys in the NFL have a platform. People listen to them.
""These players here will want them to continue to speak out and be heard, because that's the only way change can happen.""
Ware says Kaepernick was ""definitely"" an inspiration, and he hopes the influence of his kneel gesture will continue to grow.
""A lot of people are doing it now. Even the managers doing it too. That's amazingly successful,"" he adds.
""This will lead to better things, open people's eyes. We need even more people doing what we doing. Everybody speak up. Please. It's not always about the football.
""It's supposed to be the land of the free. But it's not been free.""

Puerto Rico recovery: Hamilton creator releases charity song,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Lin-Manuel Miranda has family in Puerto Rico
A group of music stars have come together to create a song in aid of relief efforts for the hurricane-battered island of Puerto Rico.
Almost Like Praying has been written by Lin-Manuel Miranda, musical creator of the hit Broadway show Hamilton.
Stars who have taken part include Gloria Estefan, Rita Moreno, Jennifer Lopez and Despacito singer Luis Fonsi.
Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico with high winds and heavy rain and much of the island remains without power.
Mr Miranda's parents are from the US territory. He said the song's inspiration came from his own efforts to contact loved ones after the storm, and also by the slow pace of relief efforts.
""I thought I could work all 78 towns in Puerto Rico into the lyrics of this song and if we did our job right, these towns will never be forgotten again,"" he told Billboard magazine.

Almost Like Praying mixes Spanish and English lyrics and takes its tune from elements of the song Maria from the hit musical West Side Story. A video of the recording has been released on YouTube.
Mr Miranda has been a strong critic of the US government's relief efforts.
""I think it's been well documented that it's been slow and it's been insufficient, commensurate to the challenge ahead,"" he told Billboard.
All proceeds from the song will go to the Hispanic Federation's Unidos Disaster Relief Fund for Puerto Rico."
Trump attacks ESPN's Jemele Hill with misleading tweet,"President Trump attacked ESPN host Jemele Hill one day after she was suspended.
ESPN suspended Hill for two weeks on Monday for criticizing Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones on social media. She had said he ""created a problem for his players, specifically the black ones. If they don't kneel, some will see them as sellouts.""
Her post was in reference to Jones's statement that any Dallas Cowboys player who ""disrespects the flag"" during the National Anthem will not play.
Some players have taken to kneeling instead of standing during the anthem to protest police killings of African-Americans, a movement started by Colin Kaepernick, formerly of the San Francisco 49ers.
On Tuesday morning, Trump questioned the NFL's ""massive tax breaks,"" then weighed in with another tweet: ""With Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have 'tanked,' in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!""

But have ESPN ratings really ""tanked""?
On Fox News and conservative talk radio, it's a popular talking point that the subscriber losses are due to rampant liberal bias. But there's little evidence to support that theory.
ESPN had 90 million subscribers as of September 2016, the most recent numbers it has reported. That's down 2 million from a year earlier and down from a high of 100 million in 2010.

So the vast majority of U.S. homes continue to pay for cable, including ESPN. But as the monthly cable bundle has become more and more expensive, and streaming has become more popular, some homes have dropped the big bundles that include ESPN.

The cutbacks have put pressure on ESPN and other sports networks. To address this, ESPN is planning to roll out a direct-to-consumer streaming service next year.

ESPN suspends Jemele Hill after tweet on NFL protests,"The ESPN logo is seen on an electronic display in Times Square in New York City, U.S., August 23, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Segar
(Reuters) - Cable sports network ESPN on Monday suspended broadcaster Jemele Hill for violating its social media guidelines for a second time in the past month after she tweeted on NFL player protests.
Hill on Sunday said football fans should boycott advertisers of the Dallas Cowboys if they were offended by team owner Jerry Jones’ threat to bench players who did not stand during the national anthem.
ESPN said in a statement it had suspended Hill for two weeks for the second violation. It said she “previously acknowledged letting her colleagues and company down with an impulsive tweet” last month in which she called U.S. President Donald Trump a “white supremacist” who has surrounded himself with other white supremacists.
Hill is one of the hosts of ESPN’s sports news program, SportsCenter. In a series of tweets on Sunday and Monday, she responded to Jones’ comments about not playing anyone who was disrespectful of the U.S. flag.
“Change happens when advertisers are impacted. If you feel strongly about JJ’s statement, boycott his advertisers,” Hill wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
On Monday, before her suspension was announced, Hill wrote, “Just so we’re clear: I‘m not advocating a NFL boycott.”
She went on to say that an unfair burden was being placed on players whose owners directed them to stand for the anthem."

"Israel’s Foreign Agents Don’t Register, Why Should Russia’s?","By Grant Smith
Can Russia Use Israel Lobby Tactics To Skirt FARA Order?
The Department of Justice has ordered Russia’s U.S.-based RT news network to begin registering as Russian foreign agents under the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law requires US-based agents of foreign principals to disclose financial information and activities in regular public filings overseen by a designated DOJ office. Over the years FARA has been amended to exclude bona fide news organizations. The Department of Justice order breaks a long period of unfettered access to the U.S. by foreign press agencies, many directly and indirectly financed by foreign governments.
Although RTs viewership in the United States is minuscule compared to major domestic broadcast and cable news outlets, over the years RT has made many enemies in Washington. The network’s slogan, “Question More,” and financial resources allowed it to televise stories that US networks, under the perpetual threat of loss of “access” to newsmakers, boycotts and organized pressure campaigns, cannot. Nowhere was this more evident than RT’s relentless coverage of Israel and its US lobby. RT covered Benjamin Netanyahu’s connection to the Arnon Milchan nuclear trigger smuggling ring, the diversion of weapons grade uranium from a toxic plant in Pennsylvania to Israel, and details of a massive Israeli-lobby orchestrated propaganda campaign in the United States. A FARA order could mean RT’s departure from the American scene. This could reduce the number of news packages on topics prohibited in America – located in the triple-digit channel nether-region of the cable lineup, but archived and well-viewed online with 2.2 million YouTube subscribers – to zero.
With new scrutiny of Russian activities following allegations of meddling in the U.S. electoral process, the FARA order should come as no surprise. The Department of Justice can be expected to deploy resources far in excess of the meager 9-person team working in the FARA department in order to finally “get Russia.” However, RT could attempt to use the tactics of another FARA target – the Israel lobby – to avoid registering.
Delay, delay, delay The American Zionist Council (and AIPAC, which was AZC’s unincorporated lobbying committee) were ordered by the Kennedy administration to register in 1962. This followed a massive propaganda campaign targeting congress and the American public funded with foreign money aimed at winning unconditional foreign aid and diplomatic support for Israel. AZC strung along the Department of Justice until 1965, long enough to orchestrate a paper “restructuring” of its operations that led to the incorporation of AIPAC as a separate entity. Politically pressure DOJ and political elites into a special exemption Whether trying to avoid an espionage prosecution (like the Anti-Defamation League) or ignoring seven separate orders to register under FARA (like the Zionist Organization of America), sometimes it takes a visit with the Attorney General himself (or in the case of Janet Reno, herself). ZOA was ordered to register in 1938 as a subsidiary and “subject to the direction” of the World Zionist Organization. Like AIPAC, it strung along the enforcement process, in its case until 1960. The registration effort was serious. An internal DOJ memo ten years into the lengthy effort noted, “…if ZOA is to be exempted from registration, DOJ might as well forget its entire campaign…” However, Justice Department employees began detecting political push-back, (PDF) “..the pressure was on somewhere in the government… it would be unwise to do anything further…under the circumstances do not desire for the moment to write to the Zionist Organization of America…” Multiple Israel affinity organizations ordered to register simultaneously refused to comply with FARA orders, citing a “certain high official in the Department of Justice” had assured them that (PDF) “the Department would not require any Zionist group to register and need not fear prosecution.” Clarify that Russia is not the Soviet Union Early in the drive to register AZC/AIPAC as foreign agents, their lead lawyer made an appeal for “prosecutorial discretion.” Maurice Boukstein argued that the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act had been crafted to target and expose Nazi and Soviet propaganda efforts in the United States. “While the language, of course, comprehends everybody,” lobbying for Israel should not be treated the same, he argued. RT, like advocates coordinating with and on behalf of Israel, could similarly argue that the Soviet Union is dead and gone, and that Russia now only wants to be friends. Reconstitute The Jewish Agency’s American Section, which had funneled millions of foreign funds into AZC/AIPAC, faced a FARA order that seemed unbeatable. The Jewish Agency’s direct ties to the Israeli government and Knesset were exposed in 1969 when the Jewish Agency was ordered by the DOJ to file its secret 1953 covenant agreement. After a 1970 Justice Department review, the American Section of the Jewish Agency filed its final FARA disclosure in 1971. It then “reemerged” three months later, claiming to be the American Section of the World Zionist Organization, an entity with no Israeli government covenant. The Department of Justice, noting that the physical address, leadership, staff, and functions of the “new” entity had not changed, labeled the reconstitution “sketchy,” but did nothing. Meanwhile, overseas, the Jewish Agency continued to funnel support to its US agents. Dennis Ross served as Chairman of the Jewish Agency’s “Jewish People Planning Institute” in Jerusalem until entering the Obama administration to head-up the fatally flawed “peace process” in 2009. Volunteer to spy for the CIA and FBI In the 1940s and 1950s the Jewish Telegraphic Agency came under heavy scrutiny to file as a foreign agent by the FBI and Department of Justice. An internal 1950s DOJ report found that, “The Israeli Government, which is seriously short of dollar credits, is supposed to be underwriting the operations of JTA to the extent of $5,000 per month…” The JTA was never ordered to register, and it is unclear whether it was JTA’s intense efforts to ingratiate itself with the FBI that finally provided the leniency it needed. In 1942 the head of JTA proposed the FBI pay $540 per month to leverage JTA’s network of correspondents in Latin America as an intelligence gathering service. To bolster the appeal of the offer, the proposal noted that the OSS (predecessor of the CIA) was already paying $300 per month for similar services. In 1950 JTA’s Milton Friedman volunteered to spy on the Soviet Union using his JTA press credential as non-official cover. JTA also offered to spy on Ukrainians residing in the United States.
Ultimately, RT may find it does not have the required number of sympathizers inside and outside the US government, the requisite moral character, or enough money to pull off such FARA avoidance shenanigans. However, the RT FARA order may reignite broader American interest in the selectivity with which FARA is enforced. The key question has long been, “if Israel’s foreign agents working tirelessly to influence the government and public opinion aren’t registering, why should anyone?”
Grant F. Smith is the author of the 2008 book, newly released on Kindle, America’s Defense Line: The Justice Department’s Battle to Register the Israel Lobby as Agents of a Foreign Government. He is the director of the Institute for Research: Middle Eastern Policy in Washington, D.C.

Maya Moore Leads Lynx to 4th WNBA Title in Team History with Win over Sparks,"Hannah Foslien/Getty Images
The Minnesota Lynx are WNBA champions once again.
Minnesota won its fourth title in franchise history Wednesday with an 85-76 victory over the Los Angeles Sparks in the decisive Game 5 of the WNBA Finals at Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota. The win continued the Lynx's pattern of championships every other year, as they prevailed in 2011, 2013 and 2015 as well.
The victors can thank a balanced scoring effort for the glory, as all five starters scored in double figures, with Sylvia Fowles leading the way with 17 points and a head-turning 20 rebounds. Maya Moore added 18 points and 10 boards, while point guard Lindsay Whalen directed the show with 17 points and eight assists.
According to ESPN Stats & Info, Minnesota joined the Houston Comets as the only WNBA franchises with four championships. It also joined the Golden State Warriors and North Carolina Tar Heels as basketball teams that avenged a 2016 loss in the championship with a 2017 title since the Sparks beat the Lynx in last season's WNBA Finals.
Los Angeles didn't go down without a fight even though it trailed 79-67 with less than two minutes remaining. Its pressing defense forced multiple Minnesota turnovers, and a 9-0 run made it 79-76 with 34 seconds left before Moore's running jumper in the lane sent a wave of relief through the stadium.
Moore coming through in the clutch was no fluke given her incredible resume, as Richard Deitsch of Sports Illustrated shared:
It was no surprise the contest came down to the end given their previous 12 head-to-head matchups:
Even with Moore's heroics, Fowles won the WNBA Finals MVP. According to espnW, she became the first player to capture the regular-season and Finals MVP since Lauren Jackson did so in 2010.
In a parallel to the NBA Finals rivalry between the Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers, there were a number of MVPs on the floor with the trophy on the line. Fowles won the award this year, while Moore captured it in 2014. Los Angeles' Nneka Ogwumike was last season's MVP, while Candace Parker won in 2008 and 2013.
The Fowles and Moore pairing prevailed, although it was no fault of Parker's. She finished with 19 points, 15 rebounds, five assists, four blocks and two steals, while Chelsea Gray tallied 15 points and eight dimes. Ogwumike fouled out but still posted 11 points.
Even with Parker, Los Angeles ultimately couldn't overcome Minnesota's advantage inside. The Lynx grabbed 46 rebounds to the Sparks' 29, which helped them control the pace throughout.
They wasted little time doing just that when they scored the first seven points and built an 11-point lead in the first quarter, but the Sparks demonstrated their championship mettle and cut the deficit to 21-19 following Parker's buzzer-beater in the lane:
However, it became clearer during the second quarter Los Angeles missed its best chance to close the Finals in Game 4 when it was at home. Minnesota extended its advantage to double digits again before taking a 41-35 lead into halftime thanks largely to its dominance down low.
The Lynx outrebounded the visitors 27-15 in the first half, and 10 of those rebounds came on the offensive end. In addition to creating second-chance points for her team with five of those offensive boards, Fowles patrolled the lane on the defensive side as an enforcer:
Minnesota started playing with style in the third behind its floor general Whalen:
Still, the pattern of mini spurts continued as the lead vacillated between double and single digits for much of the quarter before Los Angeles seized momentum when Gray's jumper cut the deficit to 60-56 heading into the fourth.
Keeping up with the home team was challenging enough for the Sparks, and things became even more difficult when Ogwumike fouled out in the fourth. That put more of the onus on Parker and Gray to fuel the comeback, which was a daunting task against the balanced Lynx.
Parker's three cut the lead to four with less than seven minutes remaining, but it was the closest Los Angeles would come until its late run as Minnesota's defense—behind Fowles' imposing presence in the paint—stifled the Sparks stars down the stretch.
The Sparks went four minutes without scoring a point in crunch time and fell behind by double digits again before their desperation charge in the last two minutes, but they dug too deep a hole to overcome against the new champions."
Danish Minister Republishes Controversial Prophet Cartoon,Warning Something Big Is About to Happen in America the Martial Law Is Coming – 100% Chance it Will Happen ( Red List and Blue List)
Las Vegas gunman's girlfriend says she didn't know he was planning shooting,"Los Angeles (CNN) The girlfriend of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock says she saw no signs he was planning ""something horrible,"" and that she is ""devastated"" by the deaths and injuries he caused when he rained bullets down on an outdoor music concert.
Marilou Danley, Paddock's girlfriend, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon through her attorney, Matt Lombard.
Danley said Paddock ""never said anything to me, or took any action that I was aware of, that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen.""
""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone,"" she said in the statement.
Lombard said Danley is fully cooperating with the investigation into why Paddock, a 64-year-old retired accountant, fired for 9 to 11 minutes from his 32nd-floor hotel window into a crowd of 22,000 concertgoers in the heart of Las Vegas. Fifty-eight people were killed and nearly 500 were injured before Paddock took his own life as police closed in.
""I knew Stephen Paddock as a kind, caring, quiet man,"" Danley said in the statement. ""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together with him.""
A plane ticket and money
Danley said that, more than two weeks ago, Paddock told her he had bought a plane ticket for her to fly to her native Philippines, saying he wanted her to visit her family.
While she was in the Philippines, Danley said, Paddock wired her money that he said was for her to buy a house for her and her family.
Danley said she was grateful but ""worried"" that the unexpected trip home and the money ""was a way of breaking up with me.""
Paddock had recently wired $100,000 to the Philippines, a US law enforcement source confirmed to CNN this week.
Marilou Danley said she didn't know her boyfriend had planned a massacre.
Danley said she had voluntarily flown back to the United States after Sunday's massacre because she knew investigators wanted to talk to her. She arrived late Tuesday at Los Angeles International Airport from the Philippines, and spoke Wednesday in Los Angeles with the FBI and Las Vegas police, Lombard said.
Danley's sisters told CNN affiliate Seven Network Australia that Paddock encouraged her to leave the United States last month.
""She was sent away. She was sent away so that she will be not there to interfere with what he's planning,"" one of Danley's sisters told Seven News from their home in Australia's Gold Coast region.
""In that sense, I thank him for sparing my sister's life,"" she said, adding that Danley was ""really in love with Steve.""
The two sisters, who spoke to Seven News exclusively, did not want to be identified by name and requested their faces be blurred.
One sister told Seven News said that Danley didn't know anything ahead of the shooting.
""She didn't even know that she was going to the Philippines, until Steve said, 'Marilou, I found you a cheap ticket to the Philippines.' ""
The sister added Danley was likely ""even (more) shocked than us"" by his actions. Still, the sister left open the possibility that Danley could provide information helpful to investigators.
""Of all the people that they have interviewed, ... no one can put the puzzles together -- no one -- except Marilou, because Steve is not here to talk anymore. Only Marilou can maybe help,"" she said.
""If Marilou was there, this, maybe, as well, didn't happen because she won't let it happen.""
Danley working with authorities, sister says
After Sunday attack, authorities in the United States, the Philippines and Australia joined efforts to search for Danley, hoping she might shed some light on the motive behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.
The search for her initially spanned several countries, with conflicting reports that she may have been in Japan or the Philippines at the time of the shooting.
Danley, 62, who travels on an Australian passport, arrived in the Philippines from Tokyo on September 15, then left for Hong Kong on September 22 and flew back to the Philippines on September 25, said Maria Antoinette Mangrobang, a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration.
Authorities in the Philippines had communicated with the FBI and the US Department of Homeland Security regarding her travel, the spokeswoman said.
In the Seven News interview, one sister said Danley would willingly answer investigators' questions.
""She's a good person, a gentle soul, a mother, a grandmother, a sister, a friend,"" the sister said, adding that Danley was having trouble coping with the tragedy because ""she's a very weak person.""
Paddock was 'quiet, not sociable'
Stephen Paddock in the Philippines in April 2013
Danley lived with Paddock in Mesquite, Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas. It's unclear when the couple met.
Danley's sisters said they had met Paddock two or three times.
""(He was) very quiet, not sociable. He keep to himself. One question, you get your answer directly. That's it,"" one sister said.
""It's a pity, though, because he's the only one really who can answer this,"" she said. ""But he cheated. He cheated. He escaped and (left) us here putting (pieces of) the puzzles together.""
A previous version of this report incorrectly said that Marilou Danley left Tokyo on September 25. She left on September 15. This article has also been updated to reflect authorities' revision of the number of people hurt in the shooting."
USS Indianapolis discovery: War hero and family reunite,"(CNN) As Tony King tells his story, he pauses often. His memory is still sharp, but the words don't come easily. Maybe it's because he is turning 92. Or maybe he just hasn't talked about that day in a very long time.
Only 19 men still living -- King among them -- know exactly how the agony unfolded on July 30, 1945, the day two Japanese torpedoes struck the USS Indianapolis.
But King never had much interest in reliving it, his relatives say. He never wanted to discuss the horrors he and his shipmates endured as they floated for nearly five days in shark-ridden waters, waiting for rescue.
That is, until now.
As CNN's cameras roll, King recounts the ordeal still lamented as one of the worst disasters in US naval history. While he speaks, his family, tucked secretly behind a wall of museum exhibits, hangs on every word.
Tony King, 92, survived the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in 1945.
They lost touch with the World War II veteran in 1981. Since then, they've searched for him on and off, trolling phone books and newspaper articles, using his Social Security number to try to uncover any trace. But it was only after an expedition crew in August located the wreckage of the USS Indianapolis 18,000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean that they got their first lead.
A few weeks after the discovery, they're gathered in California to surprise King on his birthday.
A blast shatters the night
For sailors aboard the USS Indianapolis, it all began with promises of romance and adventure.
""Join the Navy and see the world!"" the posters lining telephone poles read. ""A girl in every port,"" they promised. Harold Bray had half a year left in high school when he persuaded his father to let him sign up for the Navy.
Members of the USS Indianapolis's crew pose in the well deck during World War II.
""When I went in, I had no idea or reason to believe that anything would ever happen to me,"" Bray told CNN.
He boarded the USS Indianapolis while it was under repair at Mare Island in California, a bustling naval base that boasted as many as 50,000 workers during WWII. They could fix anything at Mare Island, including a heavy cruiser recently slammed by a suicide plane. Three months in their skilled hands and the ship looked as good as new, Bray said.
The USS Indianapolis set sail from Mare Island on July 16, 1945, and immediately picked up cargo on Hunter's Island. The crew had no idea what was inside the huge crate. Rumors and bets quickly mounted: It was a shipment of Cadillacs. Whiskey for everyone to celebrate when the war was over. Thousands of rolls of scented toilet paper for Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
The USS Indianapolis sank in the Pacific Ocean after an attack by Japan in 1945.
""Needless to say, no one ever collected a nickel from that bet,"" one survivor remarked in the 2016 documentary "" USS Indianapolis: The Legacy .""
Packed inside the crate, the world later learned, were components of the first operational atomic bomb. The USS Indianapolis delivered them to the island of Tinian on July 26, 1945. Then the ship headed for Guam, where the captain was ordered to travel , unescorted, to the Leyte Gulf in the Philippines.
Just after midnight on July 30, midway through its course, torpedoes blasted out of a Japanese submarine and ripped into the starboard side of the USS Indianapolis. Survivors have said they knew, at that instant, their ship was doomed.

A hellish wait for rescue
Chaos erupted, survivors have recalled. Men shrieked as they burned alive in the aftermath of a fuel tank explosion. Then came the deafening growl of the rolling ship.
The 10,000-ton vessel sank in 12 minutes. Some 300 of the 1,196 sailors and Marines on board went down with it. The survivors floated in the oil-slicked sea and waited for rescue.
Dawn broke. Hours passed. The sun set, but still no one came.
The reason remains under debate. The Navy claimed a distress signal was never transmitted, though a radioman aboard the ship swears it was. Other communication failures meant officials didn't notice when the ship didn't arrive in the Philippines. Some believe intelligence agents decoded a Japanese message reporting a sunken American battleship but considered it a trap.
For five nights and four days, the American sailors floated in the South Pacific with no food and no water. Because the ship moved forward as it sank, they were spread over miles, small groups not knowing each other's fate.
Survivors have said anyone who'd been badly hurt in the attack didn't last very long in the water. They succumbed to injuries or to the sharks, which circled beneath the crystal-clear water by day and glided past survivors' legs at night.
Those with open wounds or white clothing seemed to be at highest risk of a shark attack, Bray recalled, along with those who ventured off on their own. Some sailors couldn't stop themselves from guzzling saltwater; they swam off toward the imaginary islands their poisoned brains had concocted on the horizon.
Of the 900 or so men who made it off the ship alive, only about a third survived to meet the rescue ships that finally arrived on their fifth night adrift. Survivors told the documentary filmmakers stories like this: There were 44 in our group; only 14 made it. We had 123 in our group; only 60 survived.
""War is a terrible thing,"" Bray said in a simple distillation of the hellish experience. ""The only ones that suffer are the young people, the kids that have to go and fight these things.""
This map shows the route that rescue ships took in early August 1945 to ferry USS Indianapolis survivors to safety.
A war hero returns, only to vanish
King never dwelled on his time in the water, he says. He preferred to remember instead the homecoming: the big parade that awaited them in San Diego, with girls running alongside their buses and handing them beers. He left the Navy and earned a master's degree in psychology. He married a Catholic girl who died too soon. He traveled the Middle East between visits to his nieces and nephews.
""My uncle was very protective of me growing up because I was the only girl in a whole group of boys,"" Shirley Ezel told CNN.
King would visit her family in Michigan to help out while their dad was out of town. He once bought 12-year-old Shirley a brand-new dress to wear to an ice cream social at school.
""I felt like a million bucks that day,"" she said. ""It has stayed with me my whole life.""
King usually wrote home two or three times a year, said his nephew, James ""Dale"" Bogard. Then in the early 1980s, the letters stopped. Bogard's mother tried for years to find him, as did Ezel.
""Honestly, no one really knows what happened,"" Ezel's son, Ryan Summers, said. ""My father dropped him off at the airport, and that is the last time anybody in the immediate family knew of his whereabouts.""
A ship is discovered and a family reunited
Through the years King's family searched for its war hero, other relatives and comrades of those aboard the USS Indianapolis mourned all that was lost with the ship. Even as the decades passed, some pledged not to allow the remains of the grand vessel to linger, lost at sea.
Then, on August 19, a team of civilian researchers led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen discovered the its wreckage
A crew in August found the wreckage of the USS Indianapolis deep beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean.
""That was a great day,"" Bray said, chalking it up as one of his happiest. As chairman in recent years of the USS Indianapolis Survivors' Organization, Bray had met fellow sailors -- including some, like King, whom he didn't know during the war -- and he hoped they and the families of the fallen would finally find some closure.
""Now the people that lost 880 kids know where they are,"" he said.
News of the ship's discovery also kindled a spark in Summers, King's great-nephew. A history buff, he'd always known the warship story. Now, an online search led him to Bray's survivors' group's website. An article caught his attention.
It mentioned that for the first time, the number of living USS Indianapolis survivors had risen, from 21 to 22. The name that had been moved from ""deceased"" to ""living"" on the membership list? ""A.C."" Tony King.
Summers rushed to tell his mother, who posted a message to Bray's group. Within hours, she got one back. That night, she spent 45 minutes on the phone, talking with the uncle she believed she'd lost forever.
""The only thing we could say was, 'I can't believe it's you. I can't believe that you're really here,'"" Ezel said. ""If the ship had not been found, this may not ever have happened.""
A few weeks later, CNN helped unite Ezel, Bogard, Summers and Bray in California for King's 92nd birthday. They surprised King at the Mare Island Museum, a sprawling brick building with a 15-foot iron anchor outside the front door. (You can watch their tearful reunion in the video atop this story.)
Harold Bray, left, and Tony King, meet in August on Mare Island.
As Bray and King sat side by side in their wheelchairs, they discussed what many old men must: their health, pensions and the mess younger generations have made of the world.
After a while, Bray stood up. He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a medallion that he placed in King's hand. On the back was the outline of the USS Indianapolis, the ship's 10 battle stars, and a date: July 30, 1945."
"Non-Lethal? Police Tasers Have Killed Over 1,000-Many With Mental Health Problems","By Rachel Blevins
When a police shooting occurs, people often argue that the officer involved should have used a taser as a less lethal option—but some of the main points that are rarely discussed are how often police misuse tasers, and how many victims die as a result.
An investigation conducted by Reuters revealed that more than 1,000 people have died as victims of police tasers since 2000. Not only did the investigation find that tasers have a lethal power that is not being recognized by the company that manufactures the weapons, or by the departments that issue them, it also discovered that many of the victims are suffering from mental health problems.
In the most detailed study ever of fatalities and litigation involving police use of stun guns, Reuters finds more than 150 autopsy reports citing Tasers as a cause or contributor to deaths across America. Behind the fatalities is a sobering reality: Many who die are among society’s vulnerable—unarmed, in psychological distress and seeking help.
In one example, police in Ontario, California, were called to address a disturbance at a home involving an unarmed man with mental health issues. Three officers arrived, and instead of taking the 57-year-old man to the hospital, as his wife requested, a veteran officer hit the man with a taser twice—once directly to the chest—and the man died as a result. Reuters noted that this is not an isolated incident.
Ken Wallentine, former chief of law enforcement for the Utah Attorney General, told Reuters that “cops have been turned into mental health workers on the street,” and he fears that “some police training and some police practices have allowed the crowding out of persuasion and the Taser has become the default tool.”
According to the American Psychiatric Association, 1 in every 100 police calls involves a person with a mental health disorder, and as the investigation found, police officers often do not have the proper training to calm the situation, so they resort to using a taser on the subject, which can have detrimental, or even fatal consequences.
Peter Eisler, one of the reporters conducting the investigation, told PBS NewsHour that his team was surprised to find that there were more deaths from police tasers, there was more litigation surrounding the incidents, and there was a more significant financial burden on the public than they had expected.
“The weapons themselves are not regulated, not as they’re sold to police,” Eisler said. “You know, they’re not a medical device. They’re not regulated by the FDA. They’re not a consumer product, so they’re not regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. So, Taser itself has done a lot of the—did a lot of the early testing on these devices, and one of the things that we found was that those tests were not necessarily as thorough or as solid as taser may have led police to believe.”
Eisler noted that as time went on and more research was conducted, it was discovered that the taser has the ability “to change the rhythm of the heart in a way that could lead to a fatal cardiac arrest.”
Wire Tapped America - New Free Book (Ad) Taser says that these weapons have been studied and that they’re overwhelmingly safe. Taser’s position is that the risks to the heart are more theoretical. The company does not concede that there has ever been a death direct — a cardiac-related death directly attributable to a taser. What we did was we looked at as many autopsy reports as we could collect on the 1,000-plus cases we identified, and we ended up getting around 750 autopsies. And we found that in at least 150-plus of those autopsies, the medical examiner, the coroner, attributed the death either in whole or in part to the taser, or listed the taser as a contributing factor to that death.
As this investigation reveals that police are killing an alarming number of people with tasers and that many of those victims suffer from mental health issues, it serves as a reminder that there needs to be an overhaul in the way police are trained to deal with the citizens they claim to serve—especially those citizens who have mental health disorders and are often targeted and abused by the law enforcement officers they are taught to trust.

Carles Puigdemont: The man who wants to break up Spain,"Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Catalonia's leader Carles Puigdemont says the region has won the right to break away from Spain
The drive for independence that delivered the banned 1 October referendum did not begin under his leadership. But such is his zeal for secession, that Catalonia's President Carles Puigdemont is prepared to risk its existing autonomy to achieve it.
In defiance of the law and Spain's constitution, he has pushed forward in the hope of international recognition.
It may well be a doomed journey in the eyes of Spain's allies in Brussels and Washington - but the meek-looking village baker's son from Girona is undaunted.
Spanish lessons
Born in Amer in 1962, he grew up under the dictatorship of Gen Francisco Franco and was taught in Spanish at a church-run boarding school, but spoke Catalan at home like others of his generation.
Joan Matamala, a few years his senior at the school, remembers the boy everyone got on with, even the older pupils.
Image caption Bookseller Joan Matamala went to school with Carles Puigdemont
Mr Matamala runs a bookshop, Les Voltes, that has been promoting Catalan language and culture in Girona for 50 years. The young Puigdemont did not come over as a natural leader at the time but he was someone you did not forget, he says.
As a young man, Puigdemont had a passion for his native tongue, going on to study Catalan philology at the local university and polishing colleagues' copy when he first found work in the city's newspapers.
Miquel Riera worked with him at the fiercely pro-independence paper now known as El Punt Avui, often late into the night.
Image caption Miquel Riera worked with Carles Puigdemont at the pro-independence newspaper now known as El Punt Avui
""Right from the start he was very interested in new technology and the internet,"" says Mr Riera. This may have fed Puigdemont's awareness of social media, which was crucial in promoting the referendum campaign.
""He's a man who makes friends easily,"" says Mr Riera, whose 25-year-old son, he says, was bruised on the chest by a police rifle butt at a polling station on Sunday.

Mr Puigdemont served as mayor of Girona from 2011 until 2016 when he was elected regional president of Catalonia.
There is no denying his star appeal among his supporters, who clamour to take selfies with him at rallies.
His popularity cuts across class, coming as he does from comparatively modest origins, outside the Catalan elite which dominated the local centre-right alliance, Convergence and Union (now known as the Catalan European Democratic Party), for years.
""Puigdemont has been absolutely key to bringing Catalonia to where we are now,"" says Montse Daban, international chairperson of the Catalan National Assembly, a grassroots pro-independence movement.
""He's been an absolute and positive surprise for Catalan citizens, who were already supporting the independence process and saw with dismay that it was facing several burdens.""
Image caption The Catalan protests lead Catalan papers (above) but not Spanish ones
But his actions have brought him into conflict with Spanish law. And in the eyes of Spain's government, the Catalan leader has ruthlessly created a crisis, burning all the bridges in order to make a unilateral declaration of independence.
""Democracy is not about voting - there are referenda in dictatorships too,"" a Madrid government source told the BBC. ""Only when you vote with guarantees according to the law is it a democracy.""
The images of violence at the polling stations were ""150% part of Puigdemont's plan"", the source said.
""It's unfortunate because it was a trap. There's no doubt it looks bad for the Spanish government.""
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands protested in Barcelona after the 1 October referendum was marred by violence
Mr Puigdemont talks the language of independence in a way his more cautious predecessor, Artur Mas, did not during the dry run referendum of 2014, which was also banned by Madrid.
Speaking to the BBC following Sunday's violence, Mr Puigdemont said: ""I think we've won the right to be heard, but what I find harder to understand is this indifference - or absolute lack of interest - in understanding what is happening here. They've never wanted to listen to us.
""How can we explain to the world that Europe is a paradise of democracy if we hit old women and people who've done nothing wrong? This is not acceptable. We haven't seen such a disproportionate and brutal use of force since the death of the dictator Franco.""
He has called for mediation - something the Spanish government says is unacceptable.
A Madrid source dismissed the idea, telling the BBC it would be ""mediation between Spanish government and part of the Spanish state… mediation between law and someone who has no framework.
""Mediation about what?""
Rebellion
According to the same source, Mr Puigdemont is bypassing his own party in his zeal to declare independence, meeting grassroots pro-independence groups instead of conducting regional government business.
Would Mr Puigdemont risk a split at the top of the independence movement that could be fatal to the cause?
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Carles Puigdemont spoke to the BBC on Tuesday evening
Out on the streets, expectations have soared as the concepts of independence and democracy blur into one.
Some independence supporters seem to have lost all fear of the Spanish police as their sense of outrage over Sunday's violence grows.
A handwritten poster on a Girona shop front reads: ""Whoever sows rebellion reaps freedom. 1 October.""
""He may be Spain's most dangerous man, since he seems to be heading towards a unilateral declaration of independence,"" says Manuel Arias Maldonado, political science professor at Málaga University.
""A different question is whether he controls at all what happens in Catalonia right now.
""If this is a revolution - and it looks like one - his power is diminished since he cannot dictate events."""

PreseasonBlackhawks at Boston4-2 Loss Recap,"PreseasonBlackhawks at Boston4-2 Loss Recap
(Before It's News)
The Blackhawks sent their kid squad to Boston to face the Bruins, Monday night. Most of the regulars were left back in South Bend and it showed. The only regular players that were in this game were Brandon Saad, Connor Murphy, and Corey Crawford. That should tell you some things right off the bat. Not only that, but the roster listed Luke Johnson as #82, and playing defense. Jordan Oesterle gets no respect. It’s preseason for everyone, I suppose.
If not for the final minute, the first period was a complete disaster. The Hawks gave up two goals on the first handful of shots and then later gave up a third goal before they were able to stop the bleeding.
The second period couldn’t have possibly been any worse, so there was only one way to go: UP. The Hawks were able to hold the Bruins off the board while scoring a goal to bring the game back within one goal.
In the third period, the Blackhawks gave up a powerplay goal that put the game out of reach and, much like Saturday night, they didn’t have enough time to complete the comeback. Not a terrible showing for the Blackhawks, but certainly not an overly impressive one, either. Let’s hope we get to see more regulars in the final two preseason games.
The Good
Brandon Saad was able to cut the lead to just 2 goals, with under a minute remaining in the first period. Cody Franson, hit Erik Gustafsson across the ice. Gustafsson then turned and saw Brandon Saad just about 5 feet to Malcolm Subban’s right, wisely hitting Saad’s tape with a pass which was redirected by Saad off Subban and into the net.
Midway through the second period, a gassed Jordan Oesterle desperately flicked the puck up to Tanner Kero. Even though the pass was behind him, Kero was able to corral the puck and make a slick pass to the streaking John Hayden. Hayden drove hard to the net,
protecting the puck, and beat Subban. The puck hit the back post and was originally waved off, but the war room in Toronto signalled the horn and ruled the play a good goal.
protecting the puck, and beat Subban. The puck hit the back post and was originally waved off, but the war room in Toronto signalled the horn and ruled the play a good goal. For the second game in a row, the Blackhawks were pretty good at the faceoff dots, winning 58%.
The Bad
Corey Crawford only saw 23 shots and gave up 4 goals. Thank god it is preseason.
The Golden Child Debrincat had his time to shine, and was virtually invisible. Three shots on net and no points. If I didn’t know he was on the roster for the game, I might have even doubted that he played.
The Ugly
Under a minute into the game, on the first shot on net, David Pastrnak caught Corey Crawford deep in his net, and Pastrnak ate him up from a sharp angle.
thirty six seconds after the Pastrnak goal, defenseman Jeremy Lasuzon flipped an innocent dump in shot towards Corey Crawford, and Crawford just flubbed it. If you thought the first goal was bad, this one was even worse.
About 8 minutes later, the veteran Bruins caught Gustav Forsling hanging onto the puck too long and trying to stickhandle with one hand on his stick right up the gut, in his own zone. Marchand and Bergeron stripped him, and the late forward Anders Bjork was the lucky recipient of a backdoor tap in goal.

"Trump has only had a full, permanent Cabinet for 94 days","Story highlights The President's cabinet wasn't complete until Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta was sworn in on April 28
Secretary of Homeland Security has been led by its deputy secretary Elaine Duke since July 31
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has been in office for 258 days. His Cabinet? Not so much.
The President's Cabinet has been at full capacity -- with Senate-approved, permanent appointees -- for only 94 days so far in his term.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was among the first secretaries confirmed into Trump's Cabinet, but there has been frustration between the two. Tillerson re-affirmed his commitment to Trump and to his role as secretary in remarks at the State Department Wednesday after NBC News reported Tillerson had considered leaving his post and called the President a ""moron."" Tillerson denied Wednesday he had ever considered leaving his post.
Two Cabinet positions are currently filled by temporary heads: The secretary of homeland security has been led by Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke since July 31. And the health and human services secretary slot has been filled by acting Assistant Secretary Don Wright on September 29.
The vacancies came after John Kelly resigned his post as secretary of homeland security to become Trump's chief of staff after Reince Priebus resigned, and Tom Price resigned amid a scandal over taking multiple private flights last week.

Russians in Silicon Valley Can’t Shake Hacking’s Shadow,"The tension is new. Russian immigrants helped build the last generation of Silicon Valley behemoths: The Google co-founder Sergey Brin and the early Facebook investor Yuri Milner are both Russian-born.
Now when Mr. Cherkashin, a partner at GVA Capital, which is investing $120 million in start-ups, pitches companies on why they should take investments from him, he gets skeptical questions as soon as they hear his accent, he said.
“It feels like if you’re a politician and you fell into a sex scandal, and everybody knows you for this, and every time someone recognizes you they have this smile on their face, ‘So how’s your personal life doing?’ ” said Mr. Cherkashin, whose firm was incorporated in the United States.
“This is how I feel every time I meet with an investor and they hear my Russian accent,” he added. “They have this smile on their face.”

Prospective partners and start-ups invariably ask the same question, Mr. Cherkashin said: Is his money clean?
“This question comes up two or three times a day,” he said. “I don’t think people would ask this question to a manager from another region.”
Julian Zegelman, an entrepreneur and a lawyer who represents and invests in Russian-speaking founders, said potential local tech partners worried they would accidentally get into business with the Russian government.

“They don’t want to be invested or dealing with companies whose technical talent is captive in Russia,” he said.
Mr. Zegelman said he had noticed that some cybersecurity firms, big tech companies, government customers and large venture capital firms were the most wary about working with new Russian immigrants. Yet some start-ups and small investment firms are more interested in Russian talent now.

“If you would have asked 10 years ago what Russia was known for, it would be Putin, the oligarchs and oil,” he said, referring to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. “Now when you ask folks, ‘What do you think about Russia?’ you get things back like: ‘Oh, great cryptography.’ ‘Oh, it’s a lot of talented engineers.’”

Leonard Grayver, a lawyer specializing in start-ups who is on the board of the American Business Association of Russian-Speaking Professionals, said the hacking had put Russian tech talent at “the forefront.” His firm brokers technology deals between Russia and Silicon Valley, handling tech licensing and talent acquisitions, and he said the average size of a deal had risen to $4 million this year, from $1 million to $2 million last year.
And as companies staff up with Russian talent, he is getting a new question that he finds bizarre: “Are we letting the wolf in the henhouse? ” Some companies have asked him to help arrange for heightened internal security, he added.
“A lot of clients are trying to find ways to hire those Russian hackers and at the same time instituting heightened security protocols internally,” he said. “They’re isolating source code so you don’t have access to the main tree.”
When young Russian technologists first arrive in San Francisco, the person they often text is the investor Nicholas Davidov. Mr. Davidov, 30, said he was part of what he called the New Wave, which is a group of Russian founders and engineers who came over to Silicon Valley in the last few years. They gather at a Russian immigrant-owned bar in San Francisco, Rum & Sugar, and every Wednesday at a smoke shop in Redwood City, Calif., where they share stories.
Most of the comments that Mr. Davidov and his friends now get are couched as jokes, he said.
“Somebody announced me on one of the conferences where I was speaking and said, ‘I invited Nick because I wanted to collude with Russians,’ ” he said. “Just a lot of jokes.”

Mr. Davidov is an investor in Wallarm, a cybersecurity firm based in San Francisco. He attributes Wallarm’s double-digit growth this year directly to the peculiar reputation that has come from the election-influence campaign and the fact that the company’s founders are Russian.

Ivan Novikov, 29, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wallarm, was less enthusiastic about how news of Russian interference in the election has affected his life.
“Technically, any Russian who works in I.T. is a hacker, so we’re all ‘Russian hackers,’ and a lot of people like to mention it, but it’s not so funny when it’s 10 times per day or 10 times per party,” he said. “We definitely don’t like this hype about it.”
Some Russian-born entrepreneurs said they had noticed no change in how they were treated. Stanislav Shalunov, a co-founder of Open Garden, which develops peer-to-peer mesh networking software, said he hadn’t experienced anything different.
“With all this hacking news, I don’t think anyone alleges anyone from the Russian tech community in the U.S. is engaged in it,” he said. “And it’s pretty obvious that lots of people from Russia are getting hired.”
Back at what may only briefly be known as the Hack Temple (investors want a new name before it officially opens), two young Russian entrepreneurs made breakfast sandwiches in the rectory kitchen one morning last week. The building has eight bedrooms, some with bunks to fit up to four; a living room full of Midcentury Modern sofas; and a patio covered in artificial turf and often used for beer pong. Before Mr. Cherkashin bought the building in January 2016, it was Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe Church.
In the cavernous nave, the stained-glass saints were covered in gauzy panels to soften the religious feel. Volunteers have fixed the broken organ so it plays again, now for parties.
“If there would be a city in the world where you can go to church and a hackers’ house,” Mr. Cherkashin said, “it would only be this one.”
On the wall along one of the aisles, Evgeniy Lapchenko, the Ukrainian artist, has remade Hieronymus Bosch’s “Garden of Earthly Delights.” Among the twisted human figures are tech luminaries: the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs taking a selfie, revelers at Burning Man and Mr. Brin of Google in a self-driving car.

As for rebranding Hack Temple, Mr. Cherkashin hasn’t found a new name he likes.
“It can be called the Start-Up Temple,” he said. “But it’s just too boring.”"
North Korea threatens with hydrogen bomb explosion over the Pacific Ocean,"The dispute between the USA and North Korea is getting more heated!
 
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump (71) had threatened dictator Kim Jong-un (33) with ""total annihilation"" of his country in his speech to the UN General Assembly. On Thursday, he tightened the US sanctions against North Korea.
 
Now Kim beats back against Trump - and mocks him! I will tame the mentally ill, senile American with fire "", the dictator told the official news agency KCNA on Friday.
 
Trump's remarks are what Kim calls ""the most fierce declaration of war in history"".
 
Trump's threats did not intimidate him, however, nor did they stop him, emphasized North Korea's rulers. He is much more convinced that he has chosen the right path and that he must follow this path to the end.
 
Kim is considering hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific
 
Trump will pay dearly for his speech to the United Nations. Now that the US president has insulted him and his country in front of the world, North Korea is seriously considering ""taking a tough countermeasure at the highest level in history"".
 
Kim did not say what concrete steps he was considering. His foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, on the other hand, has already gone into more detail...
 
In his opinion, Kim Jong-un is considering testing a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean.
 
As the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Friday, Ri Yong Ho said in New York that he believes his country could consider such a test on an unprecedented scale.
 
Ri said so when asked what Kim meant when he spoke of ""tough countermeasures"" after US President Donald Trump threatened him. He doesn't know exactly what Kim is up to.

Athenia: Is this the wreck of the first British ship torpedoed in WW2?,"Image copyright GSI Image caption The sonar contact matches the dimensions of the Athenia in all details
The remains of the first British ship to be sunk in WW2 appear to have been identified on the Atlantic seabed.
Shipwreck-hunter David Mearns says sonar data shows the transatlantic passenger liner Athenia to be lying 200m down on Rockall Bank, off Ireland.
A German submarine torpedoed the ship hours after Britain declared war on Hitler in 1939 - more than 100 people, including many Americans, were killed.
Germany initially denied involvement fearing the US would join the war.
U-boat commander Fritz Julius Lemp had mistaken the liner for an armed cruiser and the German naval authorities tried to cover up the sub's actions.
They even attempted to blame the sinking on Winston Churchill, who on that very day - 3 September, 1939 - was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty.
The Germans said he had ordered a British submarine to fire on the Athenia as part of a plot to force Washington's hand. The full truth only emerged at the Nuremberg Trials.
Athenia: Timeline to a disaster
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared war on 3 September, 1939
Chamberlain's famous ""this country is at war with Germany"" broadcast was delivered shortly after 11 in the morning. The torpedo from U-30 struck the Athenia at 7:38 that evening. She was slow to go down, disappearing beneath the waves, stern first, at 11 the next morning.
Image caption When she left Liverpool on 2 September, three-quarters of her passengers were women and children
David Mearns, who has found some two dozen major wrecks for insurers and TV companies, says the Athenia's hull is visible in sonar data acquired by the Geological Survey of Ireland. It is split in the aft section where the torpedo hit, but otherwise is sitting proud of the sediment and looks to be in reasonable shape.
To the untrained eye, sonar imagery can be difficult to interpret, but Mr Mearns says the dimensions of the target match exactly what would be expected of a 160m-long, 13,500-tonne passenger liner. What is more, the coordinates are very close to those sent out by the Athenia's radio officer in his distress call, and recorded in the logbooks of the vessels that came to the rescue.
""Can I go into a court of law and say, '100%, that's Athenia?' No. But barring a photograph I can say in my expert opinion there's a very, very high probability that that's Athenia. Everything fits,"" said Mr Mearns, who sets out the case in his book The Shipwreck Hunter.
Wasted pursuit
The relatively shallow water on Rockall Bank, an area of raised seabed a few hundred km from the Irish coastline, means it should be reasonably straightforward to send down a remotely operated vehicle to investigate the sonar contact.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Mearns: ""My research rules out all other shipwrecks in this area""
The marine scientist first got involved in the search for the wreck in a commission from the BBC. Producers had wanted to stage a live, underwater broadcast from the sunken remains of a famous ship.
In the end, the TV idea was dropped, but Mr Mearns still hopes an expedition can be mounted by someone.
It is the first wreck in his consultancy career ""which I've identified from my armchair, so to speak"".
Searching the seafloor for sunken ships in this way is usually a wasted pursuit because of the dearth of high-resolution sonar data.
""The Moon and Mars are mapped to a greater degree of accuracy than our seabed. Our own inner-world is largely unexplored,"" Mr Mearns told BBC News.
Image caption A Punch magazine cartoon: No-one in Britain accepted the German explanation
He is now involved in efforts to change this. His expertise means he has been appointed as a judge on the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE, a $7m incentive to get engineering groups to develop innovative seafloor mapping technologies and strategies.
Lifeboats smashed
These new approaches would help achieve an international goal set last year to have 100% of the topography of the world's ocean bed mapped by 2030.
""It would be at such resolution that anyone could look for shipwrecks like the Athenia from their desk. That's the ultimate goal, anyway,"" said Mr Mearns.
Image caption The Athenia still draws interest because of the many stories associated with the sinking
The Donaldson Atlantic Line SS Athenia was built in Glasgow and the city's Riverside Museum of transport has an exhibition dedicated to the vessel and the stories surrounding its sinking.
The rescue effort by six other ships was nothing short of heroic, according to testimony. 1,306 individuals were successfully pulled off the Athenia in deteriorating seas. Most of those who died were in two lifeboats that were smashed just as they were about to be saved.
""It was a shocking event,"" said Riverside curator Emily Malcolm. ""We've got several items on display including the watch from the ship's cook. We've also got a detailed model of the Athenia. You can see all the lifeboats. It was something Donaldson had made when the ship was built,"" she told BBC News.
Fritz Julius Lemp commanded submarines for another two years. He eventually lost his life in a confrontation in 1941 when his U-110 boat was forced to the surface after being damaged by depth charges. The British captured the submarine and took possession of its Enigma cipher machine.
Senior figures in the German navy were convicted at Nuremberg for war crimes in relation to the Athenia affair. The attack on an unarmed passenger liner was a clear breach of international protocols.
The five other wrecks David Mearns would like to investigate

- a British battleship sunk in November 1941 by a submarine in the Mediterranean SANTA ROSA - a Portuguese galleon loaded with seven chests of treasure, sunk in 1726 by an explosion off the coast of Brazil
Prof Richard Toye, the head of history at Exeter University, has written about the Athenia. The reaction to the loss had echoes in the debates we have today about the reporting of news events, he told BBC News.
""The sinking of the SS Athenia, a civilian liner, was significant not only as the first British shipping loss of the war but as an example of a Nazi attempt to promote 'fake news'.
""Fearing the impact of the affair on American opinion, the Germans promoted an absurd conspiracy theory, claiming that Winston Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty, had been responsible. Goebbels has a reputation as a skilful propagandist but on this occasion he was ineffective, at least as far as international opinion was concerned.""

"Facebook will help investigators release Russia ads, Sandberg tells Axios","Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, delivers a speech during a visit in Paris, France, January 17, 2017, at a start-up companies gathering at Paris' Station F site as the company tries to head off tougher regulation by Germany. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on Thursday the company was fully committed to helping U.S. congressional investigators publicly release Russia-backed political ads that ran during the 2016 U.S. election.
“Things happened on our platform in this election that shouldn’t have happened,” Sandberg said during an interview in Washington with the Axios news website. “We told Congress and the intelligence committees that when they are ready to release the ads, we are ready to help them.”
The live interview was the first by a senior Facebook executive since the social media giant last month told congressional panels investigating allegations of Russian meddling during the election that it had found 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia.
Facebook found the ads on its network and said they had appeared in the months preceding and following the election on Nov. 8.
Sandberg said the company began hearing rumors of Russian attempts to use the platform to spread propaganda around election day, but did not give a precise timeline about when the company began its review.
Sandberg said she supported the public release of those ads, in addition to the pages they were connected to.
Information about how the ads were targeted toward specific kinds of users would also be released, she said.
Asked if Facebook contributed to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s defeat last year, Sandberg, an open Clinton supporter during the campaign, did not answer directly, but said it was important the website was “free from abuse” during any election in any country.
But Sandberg acknowledged the company had erred in how it handled the issue of foreign interference last year.
”It’s not just that we apologize. We’re angry, we’re upset. But what we really owe the American people is determination“ to do a better job of preventing foreign meddling,” she said.
“We don’t want this kind of foreign interference” on Facebook, Sandberg added. “Any time there is abuse on our platform, it troubles us. It troubles us deeply.”
She said the company had been too permissive at times in terms of how advertisers are allowed to target users, and that Facebook did not want to allow ads that may be “discriminatory.”
Still, Sandberg said it was important to protect “free expression” on the world’s largest social network. If the Russian ads had been bought by legitimate accounts instead of fraudulent ones, many of them would have been allowed to run on the site, she said.
Sandberg said the company wanted other internet firms to work to make ad purchases more transparent, but said the company was still talking about the issue with lawmakers who want to introduce legislation on the topic."
ACC Network headed to Bristol and other ACC Network Notes.,"ACC Network headed to Bristol and other ACC Network Notes.
(Before It's News)
It’s been awhile since we’ve had any updates on the ACC Network, but some news came out this week.
First many of us thought the ACC Network would be based in Charlotte, NC near the ACC’s geographic center. SportsBusinessDaily reports that the ACC Network will based out of Bristol, Connecticut.
ESPN told network staff today that ACC Network’s primary studio home will be on its Bristol, Conn., campus, where it built a 194,000-square foot studio three years ago for more than $100M for shows like “SportsCenter” and ESPN’s NFL studio programming.
This was a little uprising, but in the end it is fine. Sharing a facility with the SEC in Charlotte, may have been limiting for the ACC. In Bristol the ACC can build it’s own independent brand with it’s own dedicated facilities. Some ACC fans think the conference is still too Carolina-centric anyways, and that alleviates that. It’s only a 3 hr flight from Miami to Connecticut, so I don’t think distance will matter much. The important thing is the ACC Network continues to move forward.
Here is the second bit of ACC Network news that came out this week. You just knew ESPN would pair the ACC Network with the SEC Network where possible. Now we know that’s for sure ESPN’s strategy. From this Bloomberg.com report on ESPN Pushing it’s College Channels.
ESPN is pushing cable operator Altice USA Inc. to carry two of its college sports channels and make its flagship network more widely available as part of negotiations to renew a contract expiring at the end of the month, according to a person familiar with the matter…
…Disney is asking Altice to carry the SEC Network and the new ACC Network in the New York City area. Neither conference has a team based in that market.
I actually consider this huge news. While the SEC has their passionate football fans, don’t think for a moment that this strategy won’t help the SEC get into markets they aren’t currently and vice versa for the ACC. I think this is a positive first step for the ACC Network getting wide distribution. We’ll keep an eye on how things continue to develop for the ACC Network.

Iraq War Vet Gave Exact Location of Vegas Shooter—Says Police Took Over an Hour to Respond,"By Jack Burns
 
The response time of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department during a recent mass shooting has been called into question by an Iraq War Veteran who claims he told police exactly where the suspect, Stephen Paddock, was firing on concertgoers, which was above his room in the Mandalay Bay casino.
 
Chris Bethel told reporters he was staying in a room just a few floors below Paddock and notified police to the mass murderer’s precise location. Now, Bethel is demanding an answer to the question as to why it took the LVMPD Swat team 1 hour and 12 minutes to penetrate Paddock’s room to neutralize the threat.
 
According to a timeline produced by the Daily Mail, the first reports of gunfire at the Route 91 Harvest Festival came in at 10:08 p.m. Bethel claimed he called the police to let them know from which floor and room the shooter was firing from. He is now miffed with incredulity that it took police 72 minutes to enter the room, only to find that Paddock had reportedly taken his life.
 
“It felt like it took them too long to get over there, to take him out…to get him. And it’s actually eating me up inside,” Bethel said.
 
Recognizing the types of weapons being used, and the presence of explosives, Bethel described what he heard:
 
I could just hear gunshots, continuously. Just full automatic,” Bethel said. “There were explosions going off. It was like a bomb just went off man. And then there were more gunshots.”
 
 
 
 
 
Bethel said he called the front desk to tell them where the shooter was firing from but no one answered the phone. All the while, he could hear the shooter changing calibers and weapons as well.
 
“Seconds are going by, minutes are going by, the rounds are continuously going,” Bethel said. “Changing weapons, changing calibers, you can hear the difference in the gunshots.”
 
He told reporters as he watched the police attempt to locate the shooter’s room, he noticed they were going in the wrong direction. Eventually, he was able to get someone on the phone to tell them, “He’s not over there. He’s over here!”
 
The first look into the officers’ view during the shooting was revealed after Body Camera footage was released on Tuesday, showing the sheer chaos and terror at the scene as they searched for the shooter.
 
 
According to the Daily Mail’s timeline, LVMPD admitted they knew of Paddock’s exact location at 10:24 p.m., but they delayed in storming the room and taking out the suspect. It was not until 11:21 p.m. that the SWAT team used explosives to blow their way into the room, only to find Paddock reportedly deceased from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Bethel said he is filled with regret about the fact that it took LVMPD over an hour to get inside the room.
 
“I feel like I didn’t do enough,” he told CBS DFW. “I feel like I couldn’t get a hold of somebody quick enough to let them know. And it felt like it took them too long to get over there, to take him out.”
 
In all, 59 people were killed and 527 injured in the attack now known as the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. But LVMPD has not always been so slow to respond to reports of armed and dangerous individuals.
 
In 2010, LVMPD officers were called to the Costco in Sumerlin because concealed carry permit holder and West Point graduate Erik Scott had been seen carrying a concealed handgun in his waistband. It took LVMPD less than 15 minutes from when they received the call from Costco security until they arrived on scene.
 
 
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample (Ad)
 
After they confronted Scott at the entrance to the Costco, they shot and killed the man many said was attempting to comply with their commands. Not only was he not brandishing a weapon and not firing upon innocent shoppers, but he had his arms raised above his head when he was struck by officers’ bullets with one piercing his heart.
 
The fact that the LVMPD was so quick to respond to the call to a local warehouse club where a man was threatening no one and yet, were so slow to take action while an active shooter was mowing down hundreds of partygoers, has not gone unnoticed.
 
While the gun grabbers are quick to push their unconstitutional initiatives to take away the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms, some criticism should be reserved for a police department that arguably dragged its feet. According to Bethel, they could have truly saved lives by responding much sooner and taking action immediately after they were given the location where Paddock was firing from.

Organization May Be Forced to Return Paid Patriotism Funds Again,"By Aaron Kesel
Amid the kneeling protest during the national anthem, the NFL may be forced to return taxpayers’ funds. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) on Tuesday called for an end to all federal government support of the NFL.
“I believe we ought to terminate all federal government support of the NFL,” Brooks told Breitbart News.
“That would include the termination of any and all advertising that is done on behalf of the federal government — military and nonmilitary — to the extent we do any.”
“The same thing with any other professional sport that insults our country and our flag and our anthem as the NFL has done,” he added.
The NFL reportedly receives billions of dollars in subsidies from local taxpayers and governments, CNN reported in 2015.
Another 2015 report from NJ.com revealed that more than a dozen NFL teams received money from the Defense Department between 2011 and 2014 in exchange for promoting the military during games and other forms of advertisement.
From 2011-2014, the Department of Defense spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams for flag ceremonies. Even the U.S. National Guard got in on the action and gave $6.7 million to the NFL from 2013 to 2015.
The protest started last year as a way to highlight the racial inequality in America and fight back against police brutality.
This isn’t the first time the organization would be forced to return funds for “paid patriotism.”
In 2016 the professional football league was forced to agree to return $723,734 that it was paid by the Defense Department to honor the military. In a letter to the two Arizona senators, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said an audit uncovered that over the course of four seasons $723,734 “may have been mistakenly applied to appreciation activities rather than recruitment efforts.”
McCain and Flake, who released a letter demanding the NFL pay back taxpayers’ funds previously issued a report in November of that year criticizing the NFL and other pro sports organizations for taking taxpayers’ money to put on events at games honoring the troops, a practice they called “paid patriotism.” That report found that the Pentagon had “inappropriately” paid up to $6.8 million to both professional and college sports teams, CBS reported.
The total paid out for patriotic displays at sporting events was a much more outrageous $53 million in spending on marketing and advertising contracts, SB Nation reported.
Flake was pleased with the NFL’s response returning the money which he called “egregious federal spending.”
“In all the years I’ve spent rooting out egregious federal spending, the NFL is the first organization to perform due diligence, take responsibility and return funds to the taxpayers,” Flake said. “The NFL’s response to this investigation sets a new standard and only strengthens its reputation as a supporter of military service members and veterans.”
McCain equally praised the NFL for giving back taxpayers’ funds tweeting that he applauded the effort.
I applaud @NFL for returning American tax dollars used to honor our troops – time for other leagues to do the same. https://t.co/vLEBOy2qno — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) May 19, 2016
According to the report by McCain and Flake, this practice was supposed to be addressed with the NDAA in 2016.
We successfully had the 2016 NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] amended to restrict the DoD’s spending on paid patriotism in its professional sports advertising contracts.
So this raises a question about what other federal funding from taxpayers the NFL is receiving besides money from the Pentagon for patriotic displays? Which again, are supposed to be discontinued as mandated by law.
Before 2009 NFL players didn’t even stand for the National Anthem; it was a marketing strategy to push military recruitment.
But then the Department of Defense and the National Guard got involved. They began to pay the NFL millions of dollars to have flag ceremonies before games and have players on the field.
ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith covered this issue on ESPN’s First Take in 2016, when players first began the recent on-field protest trend:
As part of the new relationship between the DOD and the National Guard, the NFL changed its practices and began bringing players onfield during the playing of the national anthem for some “inspiring” displays of heartfelt patriotism. The outrage over yesterday’s widespread refusal to continue the practice is proof positive that the DOD’s marketing dollars hit their mark. “Patriots” who never noticed the change in 2009 have been suddenly driven into a frenzy over players’ refusal to continue being used as props in the NFL’s high-priced performance of “America.”
Even paid Senate Armed Services committee war porn poster boy leader John McCain has admitted the practice is wrong.
Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer. Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks. Wire Tapped America - New Free Book (Ad) (Source)
In 2015, Senator McCain and the Senate Oversight Committee issued a statement along with a corresponding report condemning the practice of “paid patriotism,” as charades, “conducted not out of a sense of patriotism,” but rather done “for profit in the form of millions in taxpayer dollars going from the Department of Defense to wealthy pro sports franchises.”
The report continued to detail its findings:
Unfortunately, contrary to the public statements made by DOD and the NFL, the majority of the contracts—72 of the 122 contracts we analyzed—clearly show that DOD paid for patriotic tributes at professional football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer games.v These paid tributes included on-field color guard, enlistment and reenlistment ceremonies, performances of the national anthem, full-field flag details, ceremonial first pitches and puck drops. The National Guard paid teams for the “opportunity” to sponsor military appreciation nights and to recognize its birthday. It paid the Buffalo Bills to sponsor its Salute to the Service game.vi DOD even paid teams for the “opportunity” to perform surprise welcome home promotions for troops returning from deployments and to recognize wounded warriors.
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy later confirmed that players did not appear on field for the anthem until 2009.
This controversial topic was briefly discussed on MSNBC this week, when NFL player Marvin Washington mentioned the financial relationship between the DOD and the NFL. Civil rights activist Jesse Williams also expressed the paid patriotism in an MSNBC interview this week, calling the national anthem a “scam.”
“This is not actually part of football. This was invented in 2009 from the government paying the NFL to market military recruitment to get more people to go off and fight wars to die,” Williams said. “This has nothing to do with [the] NFL, or American pastime, or tradition. … This is to get boys and girls to go fly overseas and go kill people. They’re marketing. They’re pumping millions and millions of dollars into the NFL to get us to put on a pageant in front of the NFL football games to get you to go off and fight.”

"Mexico warns U.S. against 'protectionist war,' peso weakens","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican officials warned on Thursday that U.S. proposals in ongoing NAFTA negotiations would result in protectionism and higher prices rather than free trade, as concerns about the future of the deal helped drag the peso to four-month lows.
Negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States are due to begin a fourth round of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in Washington next week.
Senators from President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) said they would oppose any deal that included proposals such as setting a national quota for U.S.-made auto parts and increasing controls over the trade in fresh produce, people close to the talks said.
“We are deeply worried by what the U.S. has added recently in the free-trade negotiations,” said Senator Marcela Guerra, who heads Mexico’s Senate committee on North American affairs.
U.S. President Donald Trump argues that NAFTA has hollowed out U.S. manufacturing, sending jobs to Mexico and fueling a U.S. goods trade deficit of more than $60 billion with its southern neighbor.
Senator Ricardo Urzua said such proposals would hurt consumers who have enjoyed lower prices under NAFTA.
“Far from trying to favor certain U.S. labor sectors, this would hurt millions of consumers in the United States, Canada and Mexico,” Urzua said.
A lack of substantive progress in three rounds of NAFTA talks since August and concerns about the hardline U.S. positions has added to market jitters in recent days.
The peso currency closed down 1.29 percent at 18.4995 per dollar on Thursday, the lowest since June 5. Also weighing, solid U.S. economic data broadly lifted the dollar as investors bet the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.
Guerra mentioned six so-called red lines for Mexico, including a proposal by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to incorporate a “sunset clause” that would automatically kill NAFTA unless it was renegotiated every five years.
Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo accused Trump of seeking a “protectionist war” that would unravel the treaty that has helped expand annual trade to $1 trillion between the three nations.
In an interview published in the El Economista daily on Thursday, Guajardo, who leads the negotiations for Mexico, said the United States was considering trying to impose restrictions on companies that do business with state-owned entities.
Ending state oil firm Pemex’s 75-year monopoly, Mexico opened up its oil and gas sector to private investment with a 2013-14 reform, attracting investment from around the world.
Some critics believe state-run companies are subsidized, creating an unlevel playing field. However, Guajardo said it would be unacceptable for NAFTA to change the rules for companies doing business with Pemex under the reform.
“Imagine what Exxon and all those who have bet on the reform and have established joint investments are going to think,” Guajardo said in the interview.
Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) plans to operate a network of gas stations in Mexico, a strategy made possible by the energy reform."
Photographer killed in Mexico as journalist death toll nears record,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The bullet-riddled body of a news photographer was found in central Mexico on Friday, state officials, putting 2017 on track to become the deadliest year yet for journalists in the notoriously violent country.
Edgar Daniel Esqueda, 23, who worked with Metropoli San Luis and Vox Populi SLP in the state of San Luis Potosi, was found in the state capital with at least three bullet wounds in the back of his neck, authorities said.
The news outlets where Esqueda worked reported had reported his abduction from his home by gunmen on Thursday morning.
San Luis Potosi’s governor, Manuel Carreras, told a press conference an investigation was underway. He did not say whether Esqueda’s murder was linked to his work as a journalist.
With Esqueda’s killing, 2017 could become the bloodiest year yet for reporters in Mexico, according to press freedom and journalists’ advocacy group Articulo 19.
The photo journalist was the 11th reporter killed so far this year, the group said. That matched the total in 2016, which was the highest number on record in a country torn by runaway levels of criminal and drug-related bloodletting.
Over the past 17 years, 111 journalists have been killed in Mexico, 38 of them under the current government of President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Reporters Without Borders and the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (CPJ) both rank Mexico among the deadliest countries in the world for reporters.
Activists have repeatedly criticized Mexican prosecutors for failing to fully investigate many journalists’ murders, allowing the killers to operate with impunity.
Mexico’s human rights commission has asked state authorities to provide protection for Esqueda’s family members, who were at home with the photographer when he was taken by force, according to Articulo 19.
Witnesses who spoke with the group said Esqueda asked his kidnappers for their identity when they broke into the home where he was asleep with his wife, and they responded that they were police officers.
The state police force said via Twitter that “there has not been any police action against a reporter in the capital.”
“Criminals, sometimes connected with state actors, know that they can get away with killing journalists in Mexico because of chronic impunity for these crimes. Until that changes, the violence will continue,” Alexandra Ellerbeck, the CPJ’s program coordinator for North America, said in a statement.
Esqueda had reported threats months ago to a government-run human rights group in San Luis Potosi, one of his colleagues told Reuters."

Will Security Measures Change In Response To Mass Shootings?,A Potato Battery Can Light up a Room for Over a Month DIY (System That Can Be Used to Provide Rooms With LED-Powered Lighting for as Long as 40 days) +Video
Review: The Future Is Always Present in ‘Time and the Conways’,"Though the Roundabout production, which opened on Tuesday evening, stars Elizabeth McGovern as the materfamilias, the story really is Kay’s. (She is played well, if with an overly neurotic edge, by Charlotte Parry.) It is Kay who mediates the two halves of the title. During the 1919 scenes she is occasionally stopped in her tracks by presentiments of what’s in store around the corner. It may even be that the 1937 scene is merely her dream — or nightmare.
For us it is a bit of both. Parts of “Time and the Conways” come off as obvious exercises in dramatic irony, as tedious as those charades. Other parts look at the world as it really is and are freshly gripping.
So give credit to the Roundabout for producing this thoughtful revival of an ambitious, vexing, multilayered drama. Still, there’s a reason it has not appeared on Broadway since its 1938 American premiere. Too often it feels like an elaborate mechanism for deploying once-fashionable cosmological ideas.
Photo
Influenced by the popular philosopher J. W. Dunne, and particularly his 1927 treatise “An Experiment With Time,” Priestley sought a dramatic structure that would demonstrate the idea that all parts of our lives occur simultaneously, even if we usually see only the current “cross section.” If we could instead grasp the whole thing, he argues, or at least have faith that it exists, we might stop acting as if “we were all in a panic on a sinking ship.”
The argument is flaky. Worse, it isn’t convincing on the play’s own terms. The evidence Priestley presents in the 1937 scene in no way bears out the belief expounded by placid Alan (Gabriel Ebert) that time is a “dream” moving us safely “from one peephole to the next.” Rather, the plot seems to support Kay’s view of time as “a great devil in the universe,” ruining everything indiscriminately.
Rebecca Taichman’s lovely staging does what it can visually to correct, or at least finesse, this problem. The simple morning-room set by Neil Patel performs a terrific bit of symbolic reconfiguration to accommodate the play’s porous sense of time, and Ms. Taichman, a recent Tony winner for “Indecent,” does haunting things with the characters who briefly step beyond time altogether. The costumes, lighting, wigs and makeup — and especially Matt Hubbs’s sound design and the original music by Dustin O’Halloran — also contribute to a vision that is almost brutally nostalgic.

And yet all this loving attention to the play’s philosophical superstructure does little to alleviate the stiffness of the actual scenes, which are filled with the kind of canned dialogue and bald exposition that Monty Python and other English satirists would come to savage a few decades later.
Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that the performances — including that of Ms. McGovern, who lately played a mother of similar vintage but more anodyne personality on “Downton Abbey” — are often overstated. That the problem affects both newcomers like Cara Ricketts, a Stratford Festival find, and New York stage regulars like Anna Camp, suggests direction that aims to score points and then rescore them as if in doubt of the audience’s comprehension.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
When, for instance, in the 1919 scenes, a romantic opportunity is scotched or a guest insulted, the action is heavily underlined to make sure that the consequences in 1937 will line up. They would have anyway.
Priestley and the production are working too hard; he would be more successful integrating plot and metaphysics in his other so-called Time Plays, especially “An Inspector Calls,” revived on Broadway to great acclaim in 1994. But even in “Time and the Conways” he is more than a philosophical faddist and domestic dramatist: He is an astute social critic.
When the revival focuses on that, it achieves its greatest depth. The interval from 1919 to 1937 was, after all, unkind to more than the Conways; it was unkind to all of England. The chance to remake the country into a fairer one, in which social stratification and wealth inequality might be mitigated, was squandered, and by the time the Depression (which the British called The Great Slump) arrived, the middle and working classes were enemies instead of comrades. Even as one of the Conway children bemoans the situation, another helps break a railwaymen’s strike — and finds doing so “a great lark.”
Priestley connects this chaotic brew of entitlement and resentment to the rise of Nazism elsewhere in Europe. It’s no accident that it’s the gauche Mr. Beevers, a despised outsider with the wrong accent, who grimly explains to the impoverished Conways that their cavalier assumptions of privilege are now worthless. They no longer live at the end of the old war, he tells them, but “just before the next” one.
It’s a terrifying comment, especially as delivered by Steven Boyer, the “Hand to God” star unrecognizable here as a distinctly Bannonesque spoiler. However outlandish Priestley’s ideas about time, he totally nailed a future truth in his creation of this furiously vengeful arriviste bully. What Priestley wants you to understand in “Time and the Conways” is that such men are not the creators of rotten societies. Rather, they are the product."
"In ‘The Party,’ a Portrait of a U.K. Divided by ‘Brexit’","The arguments that explode between guests played by Patricia Clarkson, Bruno Ganz and Cillian Murphy represent the squabbles being played out across the country.
Photo
“What you’re seeing with Brexit, and in the film, is a kind of civil war that starts small and gets bigger,” Ms. Potter said. “There are multiple forms of fracture between the characters, but they all revolve around the issue of truth and lies, and fake self-presentation. That was what I noticed in politics when I was writing the script. There seemed to be a way of spinning truth that was relentlessly inauthentic.”
If this all makes “The Party” sound like a social occasion you’d prefer to miss, it should be noted that it is Ms. Potter’s nimblest, most buoyantly comic work. When it premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in February, audiences guffawed and critics raved. Months later, in her office in a converted shoe factory in East London, Ms. Potter laughed that the response had been “nectar from heaven.”
As fast and funny as “The Party” is, it says a lot about her oeuvre that the film, her most accessible, is a black-and-white, 71-minute, real-time tale of mortality and betrayal. It’s as mainstream as Ms. Potter gets, but it’s not very mainstream at all.
If you had tried to predict what Ms. Potter would do after “Orlando” won awards around the world, you would probably have pictured a run of glossy, prestigious, Oscar-bait movies, à la Anthony Minghella and Lasse Hallstrom. Philip French, a former critic for the British newspaper The Observer, even suggested that she should make a Harry Potter film, although that might have been because he couldn’t resist the wordplay. “I’d love to see what happened,” he wrote, “when Harry Potter met Sally Potter.”
The closest she came was “The Man Who Cried” (2000), starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. But she and her longtime producer (and husband), Christopher Sheppard, have tended toward smaller independent projects that experiment with wildly different techniques and genres. In 2004, there was “Yes,” in which Joan Allen and Simon Abkarian spoke in iambic pentameter. In 2009, there was “Rage,” starring Judi Dench and Jude Law, which was made to look as if it had been shot entirely on an iPhone.
You can see why her production company is called Adventure Pictures. But Ms. Potter, the daughter of a singer and a poet, seemed relaxed about making unconventional, uncategorizable films. “Even a big American blockbuster made to a formula can fail abysmally,” she said. “There is no guarantee that a film will work, even when you go the safest possible route, and throw loads of money at it, so you may as well do what you’re interested in. And you may as well take risks to push forward the medium you love so much.”
Photo
“The Party” is another example of such risk-taking. “I thought it would be really interesting to make something that used its constraints as a way of going deeper into the characters and their beliefs,” Ms. Potter said. “To set it in one place, with no location shooting, no special effects, no car chases, none of the expensive stuff of which there is more and more, cinematically.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
She added that she wanted to create “cinema without waste, but to make the arc of change for the characters as large as possible. Everything was about a minimalist approach, for maximal satisfaction. But I had no idea whether it would work.”
She had “the most fun” shooting “The Party,” largely because of its international cast and crew. “My key collaborators behind the camera,” she said, “were a Russian director of photography, an Argentinian designer living in Paris, a French sound-recording team, an Irish lighting team, an Indian co-producer, a Danish editor — the list goes on.”

View all New York Times newsletters.
The mix was “incredibly good for everybody,” she said. “Nobody can settle into one habitual way of doing things. Everybody is learning, everybody is kept on their toes. I think, also, that it makes people very hopeful. People feel that this is the way the world should be.”
Given her enthusiasm for global collaboration, it is bitterly paradoxical that while she was making “The Party” with her multicultural crew, the result of the Brexit referendum was announced — exactly halfway through the two-week shoot. “People were crying,” she remembered. “They turned up to the set crying, because they didn’t know if they would be allowed to stay in the country. And for the British, there was a horrible feeling that this honorable way of being — the art of being a welcoming host, of setting a place at the table — was in danger.”
The shoot itself, however, was “the opposite of Brexit,” Ms. Potter said. “Brexit is about defensiveness and divisiveness, in terms of that knife coming down, cutting everybody in two. What we were doing was contrary to that, because we were cooperating to make something that would take everybody and everything forward.”"
Three Streaming Options For The Final Weekend Of The 2017 Season,"Three Streaming Options For The Final Weekend Of The 2017 Season
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Keep in mind that at this point in the season any pitcher can be scratched at any time for any reason. When looking for a streaming option you have to be careful and monitor the news and situations closely, but with that thought in mind let’s take a look at a few streaming options over the final two days of the season:
Saturday, September 30
Jake Junis – Kansas City Royals – vs. Arizona
CBS Sports – 48%, ESPN – 18.9%
If you look at Junis’ overall 4.39 ERA and 1.29 WHIP you aren’t going to be very impressed, though he has a split that needs to catch your attention:
Home – 3.49 ERA
Road – 5.03 ERA
Arizona’s offense also isn’t impressive on the road, with a .395 SLG (23rd in the league) and .233 AVG (28th in the league). While he’s not guaranteed a win, things seem to lean in Junis’ favor for a strong outing to finish up the season.
Sunday, October 1
Daniel Mengden – Oakland A’s – at Texas
CBS Sports – 25%, ESPN – 38.8%
Mengden wasn’t as impressive as he has been in his last outing, but he still owns a 1.93 ERA in four September starts and will take on a Texas offense that is hitting .231 in September. He is tentatively scheduled to face off with Cole Hamels, but there’s talk that Hamels won’t take the mound and that will further strengthen Mengden’s case (likely giving him a better shot at a win).
Anibal Sanchez – Detroit Tigers – at Minnesota
CBS Sports – 13%, ESPN – 4.4%
Over his past three starts Sanchez has allowed 4 ER over 18.0 IP, with 25 K vs. 5 BB in the process. The Twins will have nothing to play for, instead likely resting their regulars as they prepare for their Wild Card matchup. With the way he’s pitching and that in mind, Sanchez has a good chance to finish his season on a high note.

Dolphins Reinstate Linebacker Lawrence Timmons,"(Before It's News)
Dolphins linebacker Lawrence Timmons was reinstated Tuesday and will play Sunday against the New Orleans Saints, a source told Adam Schefter of ESPN.
Timmons had been suspended indefinitely after he went AWOL a day before the team’s opener in Week 2 against the Los Angeles Chargers. The Dolphins’ Week 1 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was postponed to later in the season because of Hurricane Irma.
The Dolphins located Timmons before the game against the Chargers but made him inactive, snapping his streak of 101 consecutive starts.
The suspension lasted just one week, as Timmons missed Sunday’s 20-6 loss to the New York Jets.
Dolphins coach Adam Gase had indicated last week that Timmons could return. Without mentioning Timmons, he said, “I would say that you can be forgiven if the right steps are taken.”
Gase wouldn’t discuss details of Timmons’ situation other than to say that it was a personal matter but affected the team, which led to the suspension.
According to the collective bargaining agreement, Miami could have suspended Timmons for a maximum of four games."
Kaspersky works with Interpol; Kremlin dismisses claims against firm,"The logo of the anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab is seen at its headquarters in Moscow, Russia September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin
(Reuters) - Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab said on Thursday that it has expanded its relationship with global law enforcement agency Interpol, agreeing to share threat data to help police fight cyber crime.
The company disclosed the agreement as the Kremlin dismissed claims by several U.S. newspapers that Israeli intelligence officials had determined that Russian government hackers were using Kaspersky’s software for espionage. The reports were the latest in a series alleging the company and its founder, Eugene Kaspersky, have close ties to the Kremlin.
Reuters has not been able to validate those claims.
Kaspersky has repeatedly said it has not helped Russia or any other government engage in espionage.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday the Russian government believes the allegations against Kaspersky are without merit.
He said that allegations, in articles in the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, were “absurd.”
”The government has not had and does not have any connection to such activity,“ he said. ”The accusations are ungrounded and unproven.”"

11 & US Govt Has Proven They ‘Hate Our Freedom’ Just As Much as Terrorists,"By Matt Agorist
“They hate our freedoms: our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.” – George W. Bush addresses the nation on September 20, 2001 — 9 Days after the attacks
Those of us who are old enough to remember a time before 9/11 can recall “the good old days” before the police state was ramped up to the militaristic control grid that it is today.
We remember a time before fear became the only thing that your television fed you. Sure, the propaganda machine and the war machine has existed long before 9/11, but since that fateful day, the fear peddlers and the tyrants have cranked it up a notch – or ten.
Freedom diminishing step one: The TSA
Prior to 9/11, no one heard of the Transportation Security Administration because they didn’t exist. The TSA was created as a reactionary security measure to hijackers sneaking box-cutters onto planes. It has since morphed into a vile organization of total domination, degradation, theft, and molestation.
If you think taking your shoes off at the airport makes you safer, you need to read more history.
Freedom diminishing step two: The NSA
Having worked directly under the NSA for several years prior to the attacks on 9/11, I can tell you that spying on Americans was not only frowned upon by our superiors, but it was a chargeable offense. During my years as an Intelligence Communications Intercept Operator, we were told that if we came across “friendly chatter,” we move on, or we go to jail.
However, since 9/11, the NSA has conducted an about face. The restrictions that kept myself and my team from spying on Americans were lifted. The tentacles of this police state leviathan quickly spread their way into every facet of American life. We wouldn’t find out until several years later that all of our private data has been, and forever will be, subject to the prying eyes of the State.
Freedom diminishing step three: Perpetual War
The attacks on the world trade centers ushered in a new means of the state to spread its empire. A new and vaguely defined ‘enemy’ had been declared and its name was terrorism.
“Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,” George Bush ironically said immediately after saying the terrorists “hate us…because we can disagree with each other.”
Literally overnight, the entire world was declared an enemy of the United States unless they prostrated themselves and declared their unwavering support for the US empire.
This notion gave birth to the state’s ability to declare a perpetual war. The war on the ‘tactic’ of terrorism would give way to an unlimited expansion of police state powers, and the state knew it. Bush would even state this idea in his speech. Later in the same September 20th speech, Bush would declare that the war “will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.” In the same speech, he later said that this war is “a task that does not end.”
Despite both Obama and Bush declaring the wars a success and having ended, nothing could be further from the truth as Trump’s recent plan to re-escalate America’s presence in Afghanistan illustrates. Since 9/11 secret US prisons popped up where unspeakable acts of torture continue to this day. Millions of innocent civilians have been slain and continue to be slain. Countless children have been blown to bits by Americans spreading democracy with Hellfire missiles.
All the while, the average American continues to praise the government for “keeping them free” and unquestioningly continues life as normal.
Freedom diminishing step four: The Militarization of Police
Along with perpetual war comes the perpetual lobbying of defense contractors for bigger and better ways to kill people.
“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist,” Dwight D. Eisenhower famously said in his 1961 farewell speech. He couldn’t have been more right.
As taxpayer dollars go to buying newer and nicer tools of death, these older tools of death need a new home.
Conveniently enough, the government had a program in place since 1997, which allowed for the old tools of war to come home and be used against the American people. It was called the 1033 program. Even though Obama ended this program in 2015, his champion of the police state successor just turned this program back on, paving the way for the creation of a standing army that our forefathers warned us about.
Within just a few short years, thousands of police departments across the country were issued mine-resistant vehicles, amphibious assault vehicles, grenade launchers, countless high-powered machine guns, and even Apache attack choppers—and now, all that is back.
All of this military gear, we are told, is to keep us safe.
Freedom diminishing step five: The End of Free Speech
As governments throughout history have attempted to spread their empire across the globe, a side effect is the creation of a police state at home. The United States is no exception, and as the police state grows, so does resistance to it.
This resistance becomes a thorn in the side of tyrants and they will do everything in their power to silence it.
Since 9/11, America has entered a Post-Constitutional era of “Free Speech Zones,” riot police with sound cannons blasting down peaceful dissenters, and worse. Now, identity politics are pushed upon the masses through the mainstream media causing violence at protests between the us’s and them’s. Protest violence is playing right into the hands of the police state as it easily allows them to demonize all free-speech.
As the Free Thought Project’s Jay Syrmopoulos points out, if there is one thing that Islamic fundamentalists and Islamophobic fascists agree on, it’s that there should be no “gray zone;” only black and white. The establishment’s identity politics are paving the way for this black and white world.
The gray zone is the zone of peaceful coexistence. Eliminating the gray zone – and rendering a world as black & white as the flag of the Islamic state is the ultimate goal of fundamentalists on all sides.
In fact, a recent ISIS publication, titled Extinction of the Grayzone made clear that the strategy has been at play for the past 14 years.
The grayzone is critically endangered, rather on the brink of extinction. It’s endangerment began with the blessed operation of September 11th, as these operations manifested two camps before the world for mankind to choose between, a camp of Islam… and a camp of kufr – the crusader coalition.
American policy is playing right into the hands of terrorists and the citizens are playing right along.
But all hope is not lost.
Freedom regaining step one: Be the Change
Sadly enough, this counterfeit version of the “Land of the Free” is now the new normal. The next generation’s benchmark for “Freedom” will be journalists being snatched up in the streets, and cops publicly executing citizens and not being charged.
The dystopian future that Americans are now taking part in creating is an ominous reality.
However, to those of us who see the entire picture and remember a time when it wasn’t okay for the blue gloves at the TSA to prod your anus in the name of freedom, we remain resilient.
So, next time your chest begins to fill with patriotic puff, stop for a second and realize that Americans are not free anymore. America is becoming the evil that it once stood against.
In the meantime, however, we still have the freedom in this country to inform ourselves and others. Only through a lesser ignorance will these horrid tyrannical traits subside.
Humanity is involved in a struggle, as we have always been, but there are much more of us now. Inciting peaceful change has never been more important. However, so many well-meaning individuals go about inciting this change with blunt force. As the violence at the recent protests across the country in the last year have shown—this has to change.
If you truly want to make the world a more peaceful place, you have to become a more peaceful person. Petty infighting, personal attacks, vitriol, and hate are the tools of tyrants and also of those who only claim to be awake.
Peace is true professionalism and it is also the means by which effective change is sought.
Be the change that you want to see in this world.

Iraq forces retake town of Hawija from IS,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Iraqi pro-government forces have made swift progress against IS in recent months
Iraq's prime minister says its military has retaken Hawija, the main town in one of the last two enclaves of so-called Islamic State in the country.
Haider al-Abadi told reporters that Hawija had been ""liberated"" as part of an operation launched two weeks ago.
A few villages east of the town are believed to still be under IS control.
Once they fall, IS will be left with only a stretch of the Euphrates river valley around al-Qaim, in the western desert near the border with Syria.
The jihadist group still controls large parts of the valley in the neighbouring Syrian province of Deir al-Zour, but it is under pressure there from Syrian pro-government forces and a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters.
Hawija, which lies 215km (135 miles) north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, has been a bastion of Sunni Arab insurgents since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
The town fell to IS in June 2014, when the jihadist group seized control of much of northern and western Iraq and proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"".
But it was surrounded and cut off from other IS-held territory more than a year ago, when government forces advanced north towards the second city of Mosul.
The offensive on Hawija began on 21 September and has involved army, police and special forces units, as well as the Shia-led paramilitary Popular Mobilisation.
With the help of US-led coalition air strikes and military advisers, they recaptured the town of Shirqat on the second day and then moved steadily south-eastwards.
On Wednesday, the operation's commander announced that troops had begun a major operation to ""liberate"" Hawija itself. They quickly breached jihadist defences in the north-western outskirts and stormed the town centre as night fell.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Troops used a bulldozer to push over an IS sign outside Hawija
Speaking at a press conference in Paris on Thursday morning after holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Abadi called the recapture of Hawija a ""victory not just of Iraq, but of the whole world"".
But he said the victory had been achieved ""despite the crises that some people have tried to drag us into"" - an apparent reference to the referendum on independence held by the autonomous Kurdistan Region last week despite opposition from the government in Baghdad and the international community.
Mr Abadi wants the Kurdistan Regional Government to annul the result - more than 90% voted in favour of secession - or face punitive sanctions, international isolation and possible military intervention.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he did not want an armed confrontation with Kurds
He banned direct international flights to the region last week and on Tuesday called for a ""joint administration"" in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and other disputed areas that have been controlled by the Kurds since 2014 but claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government.
""We do not want an armed confrontation, we don't want clashes, but the federal authority must prevail and nobody can infringe on the federal authority,"" Mr Abadi said on Thursday.
""I call on the Peshmerga to remain an integral part of the Iraqi forces under the authority of the federal authorities, to guarantee the security of citizens so that we can rebuild these zones.""
Mr Macron said France wanted ""stability in Iraq"" and called for Kurdish rights to be recognised ""in the framework of the constitution""."

Las Vegas shooting: Paddock's girlfriend denies knowledge of attack,"Image copyright Reuters/Paddock family/CBS News Image caption US police have said the woman, a former casino employee, was living with Paddock in Nevada
The girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman who shot dead 58 people on Sunday has said she had no idea what her ""kind, caring, quiet"" partner was planning.
Marilou Danley's comments came hours before police suggested Stephen Paddock had been living ""a secret life"".
They said he may have been planning to escape instead of shooting himself dead, but did not give further details.
It is not yet known why he opened fire on an open-air concert, committing the worst shooting in modern US history.
Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told a press conference that:
Police had found more explosives in Paddock's car at the hotel, along with about 1,600 rounds of ammunition
Paddock had been gambling just hours before he began shooting
He had booked into an apartment at the high-rise Ogden in downtown Las Vegas a week earlier during a different open-air festival where acts including Muse, Lorde and Blink-182 were due to play
But he said Paddock's motivations and whether there were any possible accomplices remained a mystery. The FBI's Aaron Rouse said so far no link to terrorism had been found but they would continue to ""look at all avenues"" without ""closing any doors"" because it was ""an ongoing investigation"".
""We don't understand it yet,"" Sheriff Lombardo told reporters, but questioned whether he could have accomplished his plan by himself.
""You've got to make the assumption he had to have some help at some point,"" he said.
Ms Danley, who spoke to the FBI on Wednesday, expressed shock at the ""horrible unspeakable acts of violence"" Paddock had committed.

Paddock ""never said anything to me or took any action"" which she understood as a warning of what was to come, she said in a statement read by her lawyer.
Ms Danley added: ""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together.""
US authorities named Ms Danley a ""person of interest"" in their investigation and said they had made contact with her shortly after the shooting.
Ms Danley voluntarily flew back to Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night to speak to the FBI, just over two weeks after Paddock had surprised her with a ""cheap ticket"" to enable her to visit her family.
While there, he wired her $100,000 (£75,400), explaining it was to buy a house.
""I was grateful, but honestly I was worried it was a way for him to break up with me,"" she said. ""It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.""

Her sister earlier told Australian outlet 7News that Ms Danley ""was sent away... so that she will not be there to interfere with what he's planning"".
Paddock checked into a suite in the Mandalay Bay Hotel on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents.
US President Donald Trump, who visited the city on Wednesday, said ""America is truly a nation in mourning"" in the wake of the mass killings.
Hundreds of people were injured in the attack.
President Trump praised the emergency services who battled to save as many as they could, despite the danger to themselves.

""When the worst of humanity strikes - and strike it did - the best of humanity responds,"" he said as he applauded injured officers.

Mr Trump said he was in the ""company of heroes"" after visiting the first responders.
""Words cannot describe the bravery that the whole world witnessed on Sunday night,"" he said. ""Americans defied death and hatred with love and with courage.""
Will the attack prompt more demand for gun control?
The shooting has prompted calls for reform to US gun laws.
But Mr Trump - who has been backed by the National Rifle Association, and spoke often of protecting gun rights during his campaign - has tried to steer clear of leaning too far either way.
After visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, he said ""perhaps that [time] will come"" for a debate.

Andy Murray & Serena Williams 'will be back' at Australian Open,"Andy Murray during a practice session before pulling out of the US Open in August
Andy Murray and Serena Williams are set to play at the Australian Open in January, according to tournament director Craig Tiley.
British number one Murray, 30, has not played since July when a hip injury hampered him in a quarter-final defeat at Wimbledon, while Williams, 36, gave birth to her first child in September.
The pair could be joined by Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka, says Tiley.
""All the top players will be back in Melbourne,"" he said.
Former world number one Djokovic has been sidelined since suffering an elbow injury at Wimbledon, while Wawrinka and Nishikori have been out since the summer with respective knee and wrist problems.
""I can tell you that in talking to Andy, he has been training and he is preparing for having a great year in 2018,"" Tiley said.
""How much would this year have hurt him, to watch over the entire year Roger [Federer] and Rafa [Nadal] share four Grand Slam titles - he would not have liked that.
""As competitive as Andy is, we know he's back and he'll want to improve his current ranking of number three in the world and getting back to number one.""
Murray had hoped to return for the US Open in August but pulled out 48 hours before it started.
During his absence, the Scot has dropped to number three in the world behind number one Nadal and number two Federer.
Last month, Murray's mother Judy said there was ""no timescale"" for his return to competitive action.
Serena Williams is congratulated by her sister Venus after winning the Women's singles title at the 2017 Australian Open
Williams' potential return to Melbourne Park would allow the American to defend the 2017 title she won while eight weeks pregnant.
The 23-times Grand Slam champion said before giving birth that she was planning to play at the tournament.
Tiley said Williams has a ""special relationship"" with the Australian Open, while the player has said the initials of her daughter's name - Alexis Olympia Ohanian - are a nod to the tournament.
""She wants to come back in 2018 and defend her title,"" Tiley said.
""Obviously, at training now, there is several months to go and it will be up to her as far as where she is with her fitness.""
The men's and women's singles winners will each collect four million Australian dollars (£2.4m) in 2018, up from A$3.7m in 2017, while the entire prize money pool has increased by 10% to A$55m (£32.4m).
Analysis
Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent
While there is nothing to suggest Andy Murray won't be in Melbourne in January, it is simply too early to say he will definitely be fit.
He is happy to be away from the public eye as he continues his rehabilitation, and is still planning to play Roger Federer in a charity exhibition match in Glasgow in a month's time.
And although Murray has not officially called time on the 2017 season, it seems almost certain his next competitive appearance won't be before the Brisbane tournament in the first week of the New Year."
Virginia Tech is right on schedule despite loss to Clemson.,"Virginia Tech is right on schedule despite loss to Clemson.

Sometimes after a loss to anyone there can be tendency to ask, what’s wrong, why did we lose, etc etc. Virginia Tech lost Saturday night to Clemson 31-17, but Hokie fans should still very encouraged by their program direction.
Let’s be honest Clemson is just at another level from the rest of college football save Alabama right now. I’m saying it right now, this Clemson team is better than last year’s national championship team. Last season was more about incredible individual talents like Mike Williams and Deshaun Watson. This season Clemson is a more complete team with a defense that is simply frightening. This Hokie team isn’t really competing with Clemson at the moment, but I believe they will be down the road.
We’ve seen the Virginia Tech program win 10 games in it’s first year under Justin Fuente. DC Bud Foster’s record speaks for itself. They started this year beating a good West Virginia team and dominanting the rest of their schedule until Saturday night. Coaching wise Virginia Tech is near or at the level of Clemson.
Player for player though Clemson is a measuring stick for where Virginia Tech is trying to get. It’s a very simple matter for the Hokies – recruit, recruit and recruit some more. Josh Jackson is a young, talented QB that Virginia Tech can build around. In year 2, it was probably asking too much for Virginia Tech to beat a team of Clemson’s caliber. Give it a couple of more years under Fuente, the Hokies are on the rise and right on schedule.

Bristol Bay: 'Most valuable salmon fishery in the world',"(CNN) This year, 56 million sockeye salmon swam hundreds of miles from the ocean toward the rivers and streams of the Bristol Bay watershed in southwest Alaska.
Many that escaped fishermen and bears leapt over waterfalls and used a mysterious combination of the Earth's magnetic field and their own sensory memories to locate the exact streams where they were born -- and then spawned, made gravel nests for their young, and died.
""It seems like a heroic -- and perhaps tragic -- life cycle,"" said Thomas Quinn, a professor at the University of Washington who has been studying fish in Bristol Bay for 30 years.
The salmon's incredible migration also sustains people: Nearly half of the world's sockeye catch comes from this one region, which is one of the last, great salmon fisheries on Earth. The returning salmon and other ecological resources create some 14,000 full- and part-time jobs, generate about $480 million annually -- and support 4,000-year-old Alaska Native cultures.
Now, however, Quinn and others fear this cycle could be strained if not broken.
For more than 15 years, Northern Dynasty Minerals, a Canadian mining company, has sought to build a gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay. And this spring, the Trump administration took swift action to make that prospect more likely.
Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt met on May 1 with the CEO of the Pebble Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the mining company, CNN reported on September 22 based on interviews and government emails. Little more than an hour later, according to internal emails, the administrator directed his staff to reverse Obama-era protections for Bristol Bay, which had been created after years of scientific review. Based on that work, the previous administration had aimed to pre-emptively veto certain mining activities in the ecologically important region.
Pebble still would have to apply for permits before building a mine in Bristol Bay. Two public hearings will be held in Alaska on the topic this week. And the public has until October 17 to comment on Pruitt's proposed policy reversal before it could be finalized.
'Complete loss of fish habitat...'
Driftnet fishing for sockeye salmon along the Nushagak River.
Among the critics likely to contact the agency are representatives from Alaska Native communities in Bristol Bay, as well as scientists like Quinn, who has dedicated his professional life to researching the area.
""This is the jewel in the crown of America's fisheries resources, this salmon,"" Quinn told CNN. ""If you don't think this is worth saving, what is? If you don't think that (a gold and copper mine) is going to constitute a threat, what would? To me, if you don't draw a line in the sand here, there's none to be drawn anywhere. You're saying that no resource, no matter how valuable, is off-limits to development -- no matter how obviously deleterious.""
Quinn's concerns are based on his years researching the bay, which were incorporated into a 2014 EPA report on Bristol Bay under the Obama administration. The report, which also was based on Pebble's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, estimated the total mine site could be larger than Manhattan and nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon.
Such a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay watershed, the EPA found after three years of peer-reviewed research. In particular, the EPA estimated 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine.
""All of these losses would be irreversible,"" the agency said.
'This is exactly the worst place you could imagine building a mine'
Based on that science, the agency made a rare call: In 2014, the EPA proposed pre-emptively vetoing certain mining activities in Bristol Bay because of the ecological risks. It did so under a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act, Section 404(c).
Pruitt's EPA, however, contends Pebble should be allowed to submit permit applications before the merits of its project are judged. ""EPA's review will be based on the whole record, all the science and an actual proposal from the company,"" EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman told CNN.
Pebble plans to file permit applications in December, said Tom Collier, the company's CEO. The mine proposal will be much smaller than the EPA expected, he said, and not ecologically damaging. In a recent presentation before Alaska's Resource Development Council, which was posted on the company's website, Collier indicated Pebble hopes to develop a mine that would cover 5.4 square miles, with the total mine site occupying 12.7 square miles. The mine would be developed in a ""safe, environmentally responsible manner,"" the company said.
Wood Tikchik State Park, Alaska.
Some researchers, however, maintain the company's approach is shortsighted at best.
""Under the Obama administration, people were willing to say, 'Look, it's very clear, this is exactly the worst place you could imagine building a mine of that kind,"" said Ray Hilborn, a professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington. ""It's not just that you have the most valuable salmon fishery in the world, it's the nature of the habitat there. The reason it's such a productive salmon place is, it's basically this giant gravel bed. But that also means it's almost impossible to contain water. It's just a giant sponge. The idea you could store highly toxic waste (from a mine) forever behind a dam is just ridiculous.""
""I'm sure once a proposal is put on the table, geologists will be able to say, look, it's a no-brainer, you can't contain this stuff forever,"" he said.
'It is a lot more cost-effective not to screw up a salmon run'
Healthy watersheds like Bristol Bay were once much more common.
Most have been severely degraded or ruined, said David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington and author of ""King of Fish: The Thousand-Year Run of Salmon."" The Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States once had sizable salmon runs, he said. What remains, mostly in the Pacific, is a faint memory of what once was, he said, thanks largely to dams, urbanization, habitat loss and industrial activities like mining.
Source: ""Atlas of Pacific Salmon,"" 2005
The ""poster child"" for this inefficiency is the Columbia River system in the Pacific Northwest, he said, which has 18 major dams, making it much more difficult for salmon to migrate.
""It is a lot more cost-effective not to screw up a salmon run in the first place. There's no question about that,"" Montgomery said. ""We've spent an awful lot on the Columbia relative to what we have to show for it.""
It's unclear exactly what percentage of Alaskans would support mining in Bristol Bay. But in a 2014 statewide ballot, two-thirds of voters chose to give the Alaska legislature power to approve or veto large-scale mining projects in the area if the projects threaten fisheries.
Some Alaskans do support the Pebble project because of the economic jolt it could bring. The EPA's 2014 assessment says the mine would employ more than 1,000 people during its lifespan, and more than 2,000 people during the shorter construction phase. The mine would be expected to create $300 billion to $500 billion in revenue over the life of the project, the EPA estimated.
Initially, Thomas Tilden, a Bristol Bay commercial fisherman and first chief of the Curyung Tribal Council, in the Bristol Bay area, was impressed by these arguments, too.
Tilden says he's not anti-development. His father was a gold miner from California. But after the mine was first proposed, he said, he started touring mines that had been shut down.
He saw pools of toxic water, massive piles of waste-rock. At one mine in Nevada, he said, he was told to cover his shoes for fear he would track dust laden with heavy metals home -- and ""not to have any contact with that dust with our eyes, not to touch any of the water.""
Could Bristol Bay turn into a similar wasteland? He decided he didn't want to find out.
'It will be the end of the line for these traditional salmon cultures'
Sockeye salmon find their way from the ocean to their natal stream.
In 2010, Tilden was one of several local indigenous leaders who sent a letter to the EPA asking the agency to study the bay and consider protecting it from a mine.
In doing so, he said, he thought of the cultural value of the salmon, including the first salmon ritual. In that informal ceremony, the first salmon to wriggle upstream to a village are caught and given to elders as a sign of gratitude -- both to the elder, who has kept village traditions alive, and to the salmon, which have returned to feed the people.
""If you've ever seen the face of an elder receiving the first salmon -- the happiness, the glow that they have, is just really heart-moving,"" he said. ""It's tremendous.""
Indigenous people have subsisted on wild salmon in Bristol Bay for 4,000 years, said Alan Boraas, an anthropology professor at Kenai Peninsula College who conducted dozens of interviews with tribal elders as part of the 2014 EPA assessment.
If there are other people left like that in the world, he hasn't been able to find them.
Source: Scottish Natural Heritage
""If we don't make some good decisions, it will be the end of the line for these traditional salmon cultures,"" he said. ""I believe this is the most significant environmental issue in the United States today. (The development of Pebble) would establish a precedent that I believe would absolutely extinguish the traditional salmon cultures and force them into modernity.""
Some villages, Boraas said, practice a baptismal ceremony in Bristol Bay's waters. Instead of baptizing people in the river, however, they baptize the water itself.
""In human terms, baptism is to remove original sin. In this case, baptism of the water is to remove human-caused pollution -- to make the water pure for the salmon to return.""
For now, millions of salmon still return every year.
But Tilden and others worry: How long will that continue?

To tackle or not to tackle?,"To tackle or not to tackle?
(Before It's News)
Fresh calls this week in the British Medical Journal to “ban harmful contact” in schools rugby to reduce the risk of injury, particularly to the head and neck, with researchers calling for the UK government to “put the interests of the child before those of corporate professional rugby unions.”
I’m all for trying to make sure that kids are as protected as possible on the rugby field, but I’m far from convinced that a ban on tackling in schools is the answer. As long as good tackling technique is taught and teachers are well-trained in dealing with injuries then there is little doubt that the benefits of playing rugby – fitness, teamwork, discipline etc – far outweigh the risks.
And there lies the possible issue. In many state schools in particular the sports staff are simply not skilled or experienced enough to teach good tackling technique and in those instances I would agree that the kids playing contact rugby may not be safe.
I also have some sympathy with the argument that perhaps full contact rugby should not be compulsory in schools – it’s not for everyone, after all.
I can’t help feeling, however, that imposing a blanket ban would be a classic case of using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.

Bump stock: The device found on Las Vegas shooter's guns,"(CNN) The gunman in the Las Vegas massacre may have rigged his guns with devices that enable a shooter to fire bullets rapidly, mimicking automatic fire.
Twelve bump-fire stocks were found on firearms recovered from Stephen Paddock's hotel room, said Jill Snyder, the special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' San Francisco field office.
Also known by the brand name Slide Fire, bump-fire stocks, or ""bump stocks,"" modify such rifles as an AR-15 to ""allow it to fire in rapid succession or automatic fire,"" said Sam Rabadi, a retired ATF special agent.
A bump-fire stock is seen on one of the weapons found in the hotel suite from which Stephen Paddock rained bullets on concertgoers below. Photo courtesy of WFTX
How do they work?
The difference between semi-automatic weapons and automatic weapons is what happens when you pull the trigger
On semi-automatic weapons, the trigger must be pulled every time to fire a round, after which the weapon reloads itself. On automatic weapons, once the trigger is pulled and held, the weapon will continue firing until the ammunition is expended or the trigger is released.
Bump-fire stocks are attached to the receiver of the rifle. The stock uses the recoil effect to bounce the rifle off the shooter's shoulder and ""bump"" the trigger back into the trigger finger, thereby firing the weapon repeatedly.
These devices can be purchased online or from a manufacturer, and prices can range from $50 to several hundred dollars each.
""You really don't have to be a professional armorer to do it,"" said James Gagliano, a retired FBI supervisory special agent and CNN law enforcement analyst.
""Individuals that suffer from severe arthritis, partial paralysis, or other conditions that affect their ability to traditionally operate a firearm can now utilize the SSAR-15 and the muscular strength in their entire arm to active the firing mechanism,"" the manufacturer said on its website
Are they legal?
While automatic weapons are tightly regulated in the US, the use of bump-fire stocks in semi-automatic weapons is legal.
Bump-fire stocks allow semi-automatic weapons to simulate automatic fire but ""do not actually alter the firearm to fire automatically, making them legal under current federal law,"" Snyder said.
But some believe bump-fire stocks, while legal, violate the spirit of gun restrictions.
""This is something that works around and circumvents our laws,"" Gagliano told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" ""You're not mechanically modifying a weapon, but you're putting an aftermarket product on that allows you to lay down ... suppressive fire.""
Could the law change?
The revelation that Paddock's weapons had such devices attached has caught the attention of some lawmakers.
""That is just a huge loophole that allows you to convert a weapon into something that is like an automatic gun,"" Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat, told CNN.
Titus is among several members of Congress who want to restrict bump-fire stocks.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, introduced legislation Wednesday that would ban manufacturing or procession of accessories that accelerate a semi-automatic rifle's rate of fire to that of an automatic weapon.
""Why can't we stop this?"" Feinstein said. ""Why can't we keep a weapon from becoming a military battlefield weapon?""
Automatic weapons are illegal, but devices like bump stocks that modify a gun to fire at fully-automatic rates ARE legal. That makes no sense. We introduced a bill today to close that loophole. https://t.co/YYAJADDovR — Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) October 4, 2017
Twenty-six of her Democratic colleagues are on board, but the measure has no formal Republican support. Several senators said Wednesday they were unfamiliar with what bump stocks are and needed to look into them before weighing in on the legislation.
""We'll get hold of some folks in the industry and find out what they do and we'll look at Dianne's bill and make a decision in due time,"" said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana.
Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, said he couldn't respond to the legislation until his staffers could show him how the devices work and ""how that affects law.""
The purchase of fully automatic weapons has been restricted in the US since the 1930s.
But bump-fire stocks didn't exist when the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934 or when the law was amended in 1986 to prohibit the transfer or possession of machine guns by civilians.
""As technology has come through in the last number of years I believe the original authors of the act probably did not envision this kind of accessory being used for modifications of this sort,"" Rabadi said."
Let It Burn? Usher Cut a $1.1 MILLION Check to a Woman He Infected with Herpes [Court Documents Added],"According to Radar Online, legal documents detail how Usher had ‘rigorous unprotected sex’ without disclosing he had the virus. The papers also show that he was ‘exposed to herpes’ in 2009 or 2010. Usher finalized his divorce from Tameka Foster in 2009.
 
You can read the official court documents here. The woman has been identified in the documents posted by Radar as Maya Fox-Davis — the SAME bridesmaid who Tameka Foster accused Usher of sleeping with in court.
 
 
via Radar Online:
 
In a disgusting revelation, a “greenish discharge” once oozed from the performer’s penis, but otherwise he had no signs of the infection and was labeled an “asymptomatic carrier” by doctors.
 
After initially admitting concern to his partner, Usher — who’s worth a cool $180 million — later convinced her that an STD examination result was negative, and they continued to engage in unprotected sex.
 
“Believing Raymond’s statements that it had been nothing and cleared up, [she] continued her relationship,” a lawyer for the victim wrote in a legal complaint for damages.
 
Their romps went without a hitch until three weeks after a passionate hookup when the victim — whose identity is being withheld by Radar — woke up “feeling very sick” with a “fever of 100 degrees, chills, headache, and aches and pains.”
 
She “also developed lesions and blisters in her vagina,” and was so terrified she sought treatment at urgent care, where a doctor promptly diagnosed her with herpes.
 
According to the document, the “Yeah!” singer — going by the pseudonym “Papa Bear” in messages — posted a check covering her medical bills totaling $2,754.40.
 
Usher — now married to Grace Miguel, former executive chef on The Cosby Show — is accused of “consciously and purposefully” withholding his herpes diagnosis from the woman “and continued to have unprotected sex.”
 
The legal complaint was filed at the Superior Court in Los Angeles. California law requires a person who knows or should know they are infected with genital herpes to avoid sexual contact with an uninfected person — or to warn potential partners before sexual contact occurs.
 
After being confronted by his partner for infecting her, Usher called her two days later with his doctor, who confirmed he carries the herpes virus.
 
Her test results confirmed a first-time infection and a file in the settlement reads: “In a series of telephone conversations and online chat sessions, [Usher] has apologized for infecting [her] and told her he would take care of things.”
 
In a declaration, the celebrity fashionista said she “feels that her health and body have been ruined,” and she “has suffered severe emotional distress and has been extremely depressed … knowing there is no cure.”
 
Usher eventually settled with his ex on Dec. 28, 2012, coughing up a total of $1.1 million.
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about ONE out of SIX people in the United States between the ages of 14 to 49 have genital herpes.
 
One out of six.

What if Platforms Like Facebook Are Too Big to Regulate?,"The same week Uber was given notice in London, Mark Zuckerberg sat down in front of a camera in Menlo Park, Calif. His desaturated earth-tone palette was matched color for color by his office in the background, as if to provide camouflage. Indeed, it was easy to miss the sheer range and strangeness of what he was there to say. “I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,” he said. “The integrity of our elections is fundamental to democracy around the world.”
Facebook had recently disclosed that it believed Russian state actors purchased political ads during the 2016 election; more broadly, it had been accused of allowing disinformation and misinformation to thrive on its platform. Among the measures that Zuckerberg said his company would take included expanding “partnerships” with election commissions around the world and “working proactively to strengthen the democratic process.” Most striking, coming from the C.E.O. of a publicly traded American social-media company, was this line: “We have been working to ensure the integrity of the German elections this weekend.”
Social-media companies aren’t new to defending themselves in ideological terms — they’re just not used to doing it on their home turf. While to authoritarian regimes, the threat of social media is obvious, in the United States, Facebook, Twitter and Google have for years talked about themselves freely in the language of democracy, participation and connectivity. The emerging tension between internet platforms and democratic governments, however, seems to stem less from their obvious rhetorical differences than from their similarities.

Facebook’s transition from a confident stride to a guarded crouch was conspicuous and sudden, arriving roughly at the same time as President Trump. Shortly after the 2016 election, Zuckerberg dismissed heated claims that misinformation on his platform had gotten Trump elected as a “pretty crazy idea.” In September, he admitted that his comment was dismissive, but did so after months of near-constant scrutiny, including, according to The Washington Post, a postelection lecture from President Obama. In an interview with Bloomberg published in September, he sounded more wistful than irritated: “For most of the existence of the company, this idea of connecting the world has not been a controversial thing,” he said. “Something changed.” It certainly had: Facebook was being implicated as potentially harmful to the systems within which it had thrived, and with which it had sought to identify itself.

The problem was that Facebook had outgrown every context except its own. Though it neither thinks like nor resembles a government, it has effectively sewn itself into the fabric of users’ public and personal lives. Facebook accounts have now become something like IDs, enabling an ever-growing range of activities: commerce, job-seeking, leisure. Networks stand in for community; encryption, in owned and operated services like WhatsApp, stands in for guarantees of liberty; newsfeeds become sources of diverse information, including ads, yes, but also calls to register to vote — to apply elsewhere what you’ve increasingly experienced online.
All this is to say that a sufficiently successful social platform is experienced, much like Uber, as a piece of infrastructure. Except, instead of wrapping its marketplace around a city’s roads, Facebook makes a new market around communication, media and civil society. This, from a founder’s perspective, is an electrifying outcome. But this cultural metastasis has led to a swift and less-than-discriminate backlash. Already, calls for regulating the largest internet platforms are growing louder while remaining tellingly vague. After all, what can a government realistically do about a problem like Facebook?
It’s very likely that any approach to regulating Facebook will look more like diplomacy than anything else — a cautious search for détente with an institution that ultimately gets to set its own laws, whether a government likes it or not. Indeed, the company has been presenting itself as a willing, generous participant in American investigations, but more generally as a supranational, self-regulating force for good, and, boldly, as indispensable for the continuation of democracy around the world. “We will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world,” Zuckerberg said, “but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere.” For citizen users, it’s a gesture of good faith. To skeptical countries, it’s a gentle declaration of independence, or maybe a dare. For Facebook, it’s something distinct, new and unmistakably statelike: a claim of sovereignty."

Factbox: Entities subject to sanctions that bought Microsoft products,"(Reuters) - Software produced by Microsoft Corp has been acquired by entities in Russia and Crimea that are subject to sanctions barring companies based in the United States from doing business with them.
The products in each case were sold via third parties and Reuters has found no evidence that Microsoft sold products directly to firms or organizations hit by the U.S. sanctions.
Below is a selection of some of the transactions involving Microsoft products and sanctioned firms and bodies, based on state procurement data:
ALMAZ-ANTEY
Russian state-owned airspace and defense corporation Almaz–Antey bought more than 500 Microsoft products between autumn 2014 and spring 2017. Those transactions included the purchase and delivery of eight Microsoft Windows Open License Program (OLP) Server licenses for NPO Almaz, a division of Almaz-Antey. The licenses were sold by Moscow-registered company Syssoft, which is mentioned among Microsoft partners on Microsoft’s website.
Neither Almaz-Antey nor Syssoft responded to requests for comment.
Almaz-Antey was added to the U.S. government’s “specially designated nationals” list in July 2014. The firm manufactures the BUK surface-to-air missile. Dutch prosecutors say that a BUK missile, launched from a site in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, brought down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in July 2014. All 298 people on board were killed. Russia denies that it or pro-Moscow rebels were responsible.
KRYM HEALTH RESORT
The “Krym” health resort, in Crimea, owned by the Russian Defence Ministry, in March 2017 acquired 109 Microsoft OLP Windows Server and SQLServer licenses, according to the data-base. The resort bought the software from the firm Nash Parus, registered in Simferopol in Crimea. The resort declined to comment, and the two vendor firms did not respond to requests for comment.
BELOGORSKY DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION
The administration of Crimea’s Belogorsky District in December 2015 acquired 155 Windows licenses. Eighty were OLP Windows Server licenses, and the rest were Full Packaged Product (FPP) licenses, which are sold off-the-shelf and do not require details of the license holder to be registered. The vendor was a firm called Positronika Integratsiya. The administration and the vendor did not respond to requests for comment.
NPO BAZALT
NPO Bazalt, a Russian state arms manufacturer acquired 101 Windows Server licenses in August 2016. The vendor was Moscow-registered firm OOO Ifrit. The procurement documents do not specify if the products were Open License Programs. The delivery of the Microsoft products to Bazalt was confirmed to Reuters by a participant in the deal. Bazalt was added to the U.S. government’s “specially designated nationals” list in July 2014.
Neither Bazalt nor Ifrit responded to Reuters requests for comment.
GLAVGOSEXPERTIZA
State agency Glavgosexpertiza bought 180 Microsoft server licenses in August 2017. The supplier was a company called OOO Nautilius. The products were Open License Programs. The agency was added to Washington’s “specially designated nationals” list in September, 2016. The U.S. government cited the firm’s role reviewing project documentation for the Kerch Bridge, being built by Moscow to connect the Crimean peninsula to Russia. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko last month ordered his government to sue Russia over construction of the bridge.
When contacted by Reuters, Glavgosexpertiza replied via email that “the company operates within the Russian legal framework”, including on major transactions. Reuters was unable to contact the supplier, Nautilius."
India Supreme Court bans fireworks in Delhi ahead of Diwali,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Millions of Indians celebrate Diwali, a Hindu festival, by setting off firecrackers.
India's Supreme Court has banned fireworks in the capital Delhi, in the run-up to the Hindu festival of Diwali.
The court said it wanted to test if banning fireworks would make a difference to Delhi's air quality, ranked among the worst in the world.
The ban on the sale and distribution of firecrackers will last until 1 November. Diwali falls on 18 October.
Diwali, the most important Hindu festival in north India, celebrates the victory of good over evil.
The Supreme Court order came in response to several petitions, asking for a restoration of the ban it had first ordered in November 2016, before temporarily lifting it in September.
It had said at the time that a complete ban would be an ""extreme step"".
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Smog enveloped Delhi after Diwali in 2016
India's Central Pollution Control Board told the court it also wanted the ban to be restored.
However those who have already bought fireworks will be able to set them off.
Last year's ban on the ""possession, stocking and selling"" of fireworks was ordered only after Diwali, when the city's air quality had already reached hazardous levels.
Choking smog had even forced the Delhi government to shut all schools for three days.
There have been several campaigns in the past asking people to use fewer fireworks during the festival, but these have not been very successful."

"At Queens Museum, the Director Is as Political as the Art","But Ms. Raicovich, 44, almost three years into her tenure at the Queens Museum, has been notably outspoken on various hot-button topics, particularly immigration and DACA. It’s an issue that hits close to home. Five percent of her staff members are DACA recipients, or Dreamers, as they are known, and the museum is operating in a borough where about 91,000 undocumented immigrants are eligible for DACA, the highest of New York City’s five boroughs.
National politics is sensitive territory that arts organizations all over the country are trying to navigate during this polarized era, and some are asking whether it is appropriate for museum directors to also be public advocates.
“It’s hard to put one’s own politics aside when we represent public institutions that welcome all viewpoints,” said Anne Pasternak, the director of the Brooklyn Museum. “This is a moment when cultural leaders are asking themselves, do I want to be on the right side of history?”

Traditionally, museum directors have remained behind the scenes, allowing the art they show to speak for itself. But increasingly they have been forced to defend and — in two recent cases, at the Guggenheim and the Louvre — remove controversial exhibitions. Many see the withdrawal of artwork as a troubling development for cultural institutions that are supposed to champion free expression.
When the Trump era of fast-moving political developments headed toward cultural institutions this year — specifically the president’s proposed defunding of the National Endowment for the Arts — at least two museum directors in New York felt compelled to jump into the fray.

Some museums have also responded by quickly staging politically relevant exhibitions. To protest Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration, the Museum of Modern Art in February rehung part of its permanent collection with works by artists from some of the majority-Muslim nations whose citizens were blocked from entering the United States. And the Brooklyn Museum organized its recent show, “The Legacy of Lynching: Confronting Racial Terror in America,” in just five weeks.
But in Queens, where 165 different languages are spoken, Ms. Raicovich seems to be charting her own community-focused path, with an emphasis on making the museum a safe haven for the borough’s large immigrant population.
“I take my leadership very seriously — not just in a physical and managerial sense,” Ms. Raicovich said in a recent interview at her museum office. “Care and equity has to be part of what I bring to my position.
“This isn’t an abstraction; this is real,” she added. “It’s people that I work with every day. This museum is interacting with immigrants.”
On Mr. Trump’s Inauguration Day in January, the Queens Museum closed its galleries in solidarity with an art strike called by hundreds of artists — including Cindy Sherman, Richard Serra and Louise Lawler — to combat, as the organizers put, it “the normalization of Trumpism — a toxic mix of white supremacy, misogyny, xenophobia, militarism, and oligarchic rule.” The museum invited the community to come make protest posters, buttons and banners (materials provided for free).
And, since some immigrant residents have been newly wary of going out in public — Ms. Raicovich said attendance noticeably dropped after the election — the museum has been holding events in people’s homes and on their blocks. “Xenophobia is not a new thing,” Ms. Raicovich said. “Our work has just intensified.”
A politically outspoken museum director could run the risk of alienating trustees, donors and potential future employers, who may disagree with her views or deem such advocacy inappropriate. But so far, the Queens Museum board has supported Ms. Raicovich. “This is an engaged time, and she is an engaged leader who has placed values of difference and multiplicity at the center of her leadership,” Mark J. Coleman, the museum’s chairman, said.
Artists also say they appreciate Ms. Raicovich’s bold stances. “Having a young director brave enough to talk about issues that are directly affecting Americans — especially people born Dreamers — is so worthy,” said the conceptual visual artist Mel Chin, who will have a retrospective at the museum in April. “Someone in a position to speak out on behalf of people who don’t have voices is what it’s all about.”

To help New York’s cultural institutions through this thicket, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs and the Ford Foundation last spring invited arts leaders to a discussion with legal experts on what is permissible for nonprofits in lobbying and political activity. Nonprofit laws bar institutions from engaging in electoral politics and holding political fund-raisers, a hornet’s nest the Queens Museum ran into this past summer when it appeared to cancel and then reinstate an Israel-sponsored event after accusations of anti-Semitism.
Photo
Two city officials in August called for Ms. Raicovich’s removal, and one of them, Councilman Rory I. Lancman, said in an interview this month that he is still awaiting the results of the museum’s investigation into the matter.
“The museum discriminated against a Jewish organization in a way that I think makes it impossible for her to serve as the head of the museum,” he said. “I have given the board of the museum the opportunity to conduct a thorough investigation and present me with facts showing me she’s not at fault, and she should not be removed, but they haven’t done so yet.”
Mr. Coleman said the museum’s board could not elaborate on its ongoing investigation, but he expected it to be concluded by the end of November.

Ms. Raicovich said the decision regarding the Israel event, which was made by the board, simply had to do with an application of the museum’s space rental practice, which has not permitted art fund-raisers, auctions or political events. The board then decided to overrule its initial decision and allow the event upon realizing that a museum official had led the Israeli Ambassador to believe the rental would proceed.
“The decision was not anti-Semitic,” Ms. Raicovich said. “The accusation is very painful. This is not who I am. My grandmother helped young Jewish men escape across the border out of fascist Italy during the war. My husband is the grandson of Holocaust survivors. I have dedicated my career to freedom of expression, inclusiveness and civic discourse.”
For Ms. Raicovich, immigration issues are also personal. Her father is Italian; her mother, Italian-American. Raised mostly in Roslyn, N.Y., she also spent years in Milan and Bucharest as a child when her father worked as a banker there.
The Queens Museum — built as a pavilion for the 1939 World’s Fair and then home to the United Nations General Assembly before becoming a museum in 1972 — was physically in her life at an early age; she learned to drive a stick shift nearby, often stalling in front of its entrance.
After a brief stint at the Guggenheim, she spent 10 years at Dia Art Foundation, before joining the nonprofit Creative Time in 2012 to expand the organization’s international presence.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Because the Queens Museum has a collaborative quality and loyal staff similar to that of Dia and Creative Time, Ms. Raicovich said she felt “at home” in becoming director. Nevertheless, she said there has been a learning curve in “understanding what it means to be in Queens.”
“What is hyper local here is intrinsically linked to what is international,” she said.
In addition to mounting exhibitions like the artist Patty Chang’s multimedia “Wandering Lake” or “Never Built New York,” about unrealized architectural plans, the museum offers Immigrant Movement International, a community storefront space on Roosevelt Avenue that provides free educational, health and legal services. And the museum will in the next few years house a branch of the Queens Public Library.
“The highest-level curatorial program also has to be rooted in the realm of the real,” Ms. Raicovich said.
“To be a responsible citizen in a democracy, one has to be involved in a kind of civic engagement,” she added. “Culture has a huge role to play in that. And museums have a huge role to play in that.”"
Exclusive: U.S. warship sails near islands Beijing claims in South China Sea - U.S. officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea on Tuesday, three U.S. officials told Reuters, prompting anger in Beijing, even as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks Chinese cooperation in reining in North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs.
The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters. But it was not as provocative as previous ones carried out since Trump took office in January.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chafee, a guided-missile destroyer, carried out normal maneuvering operations that challenged “excessive maritime claims” near the Paracel Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has territorial disputes with its neighbors.
China’s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that a warship, two fighter jets and a helicopter had scrambled to warn the U.S. ship away, adding it had infringed upon China’s sovereignty and security with its “provocation”.
China would further strengthen its naval and air defenses, the ministry said.
“We demand the U.S. side earnestly take steps to correct its mistakes,” it added.
Related Coverage China says U.S. violated its sovereignty in South China Sea
Speaking earlier at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had lodged “stern representations” with the United States, and reiterated that the Paracels were Chinese territory.
“China will continue to take resolute measures to protect Chinese sovereign territory and maritime interests. China urges the U.S. to conscientiously respect China’s sovereign territory and security interests, conscientiously respect the efforts regional countries have made to protect peace and stability in the South China Sea, and stop these wrong actions.”
Next month, Trump makes his first visit to Asia as president, including a stop in China, which he has been pressuring to do more to rein in North Korea. China is North Korea’s neighbor and biggest trading partner.
Unlike in August, when a U.S. Navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, officials said the destroyer on Tuesday sailed close to but not within that range of the islands.
USS Chafee, a US Navy destroyer which operates 100 percent on biofuel, sails about 150 miles (241 km) north of the island of Oahu during the RIMPAC Naval exercises off Hawaii July 18,2012. REUTERS/Hugh Gentry
Twelve nautical miles mark internationally recognized territorial limits. Sailing within that range is meant to show the United States does not recognize territorial claims.
The Pentagon did not comment directly on the operation, but said the United States carried out regular freedom-of-navigation operations and would continue to do so.
China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.
Experts and some U.S. officials have criticized former president Barack Obama for potentially reinforcing China’s claims by sticking to innocent passage, in which a warship effectively recognized a territorial sea by crossing it speedily without stopping.
The U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and that they are separate from political considerations.
The United States has said it would like to see more international participation in freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea.
NORTH KOREA ISSUE
Trump’s trip to Asia will likely be dominated by the North Korean nuclear threat. He will also visit South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines.
In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
Trump’s visit to China will reciprocate a trip to the United States made in April by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. president’s attempts to get Chinese help with North Korea have met with limited success so far, but he has gone out of his way to thank Xi for his efforts."

The 2017 White Sox Season Provided More Positives than Negatives,"The 2017 White Sox Season Provided More Positives than Negatives
(Before It's News)
Late Sunday afternoon, Tim Anderson grounded out to third base to end the 2017 Chicago White Sox season. A season in which the team’s future was decided before pitchers and catchers reported back in February. The 2017 season was the beginning of a rebuild for the White Sox and all those involved were dreading having to go through the death march that is a rebuilding, non-competitive season. In the end, it didn’t feel that bad especially with the arrow pointing up for the White Sox heading into 2018. With two major trades that sent quality talent elsewhere before the start of the season on April 3rd, Opening Day could not have gotten off to a rockier start for the White Sox and their fan base. The original Opening Day was confusing as a good portion of the fans showed up and were only treated to player introductions before the game postponed due to rain. The season would start the following day and saw Jose Quintana get roughed up in his first opening day start giving up five runs. Quintana’s early season struggles worried fans as they feared his inconsistencies would hurt his trade value. They were wrong as Quintana would garner the biggest regular season acquisition for the White Sox as he was traded to the crosstown Chicago Cubs on July 13th as the Cubs sent back highly touted prospects in outfielder Eloy Jiminez and pitcher Dylan Cease. During the first half of the White Sox season, fans were more interested the possibilities of trades for such White Sox players as Todd Frazier, Melky Cabrera, David Robertson, Tommy Kahle, and Miguel Gonzalez, all of who were traded during the season. General manager Rick Hahn did his best to get the highest value for each player with the league knowing that the White Sox were looking to trade off assets already. His most impressive trades actually received the lowest amount of attention as he traded relief pitcher Anthony Swarzak to the Milwaukee Brewers on July 25th in return for the Brewers 13th ranked prospect outfielder Ryan Cordell. Two days later, Hahn traded another relief pitcher in Dan Jennings to the Tampa Bay Rays in return for first baseman Casey Gillaspie who was named the Rays’ 2016 Minor League Player of the Year. The second half of the season was exciting for a different reason as a good portion of the minor league talent the White Sox had acquired in the off-season trades were called up to the majors to play the rest of the season. The most exciting call-up was for second baseman Yoan Moncada who was the main piece for the White Sox in the Chris Sale trade. In 53 games Moncada drew 28 walks and finished with a slash line of .230/.335/.743. Other prospects called up were pitchers Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo Lopez, and Carson Fulmer who all pitched well in the month of September recording quality starts in most of their outings. It is also important to note the achievements of two of the remaining veterans for the White Sox in first baseman Jose Abreu and outfielder Avasil Garcia. Abreu made history as he posted his fourth consecutive season with 25+ home runs and over 100 RBIs driven to start a career joining only Albert Pujols and Joe DiMaggio as the only players in Major League history to do so. Garcia had a season no one saw coming as he finished third in the majors for batting average as he hit .330 on the season and made the All-Star team for the first time. He improved his batting average by .85 points and his on base percentage by .73. The White Sox added to the rebuild during the season as they signed the most-sought after international talent in outfielder Luis Robert on May 27th. Robert is ranked third on the White Sox Top 30 Prospects list and ranks 22nd on MLB’s Top 100 Prospects List. He is one of six White Sox players on the Top 100 list, four of which rank in the top 50 of that list. In 2016, The White Sox had only two players rank on that list with none being in the top 50 of the list. Unlike the 2016-17 offseason, The White Sox will not have a lot of major league talent to trade for minor league prospects as the only veteran talent they will feature will be Garcia and Abreu. Hahn will look to sign mid-level free agents again with the hopes to flip them for prospects at the trade deadline just like did this season. The team has the possibility to compete in 2018 or at least show signs of improvement from this season as their young talent will have another year of major league experience underneath their belt. Also, prospects such as Jiminez, Michael Kopech, Alec Hansen, and Zach Collins have the possibility of making their major league debut in 2018. In a season that saw the White Sox lose 95 games and obtain the fourth overall pick in next years amateur draft, the season as a whole was more exciting than what it was initially expected to be. The players on this season’s roster deserve a lot of recognition as they played hard and had fun as a team even with knowing what was expected all season long. Fans and the organization handled the first year of a rebuild as there were more positive vibes than negative vibes during the entirety of the season. When the White Sox are competitive once again, the 2017 season will serve as a fond memory for all as it will be looked at as where it all began for the White Sox future success.

Federal Reserve Will Continue Cutting Economic Life Support,"[gard align='center']
By Brandon Smith
I remember back in mid-2013 when the Federal Reserve fielded the notion of a “taper” of quantitative easing measures. More specifically, I remember the response of mainstream economic analysts as well as the alternative economic community. I argued fervently in multiple articles that the Fed would indeed follow through with the taper, and that it made perfect sense for them to do so given that the mission of the central bank is not to protect the U.S. financial system, but to sabotage it carefully and deliberately. The general consensus was that a taper of QE was impossible and that the Fed would “never dare.” Not long after, the Fed launched its taper program.
Two years later, in 2015, I argued once again that the Fed would begin raising interest rates even though multiple mainstream and alternative sources believed that this was also impossible. Without low interest rates, stock buybacks would slowly but surely die out, and the last pillar holding together equities and the general economy (besides blind faith) would be removed. The idea that the Fed would knowingly take such an action seemed to be against their “best self interest;” and yet, not long after, they initiated the beginning of the end for artificially low interest rates.
The process that the Federal Reserve has undertaken has been a long and arduous one cloaked in disinformation. It is a process of dismantlement. Through unprecedented stimulus measures, the central bank has conjured perhaps the largest stock and bond bubbles in history, not to mention a bubble to end all bubbles in the U.S. dollar.
Stocks in particular are irrelevant in the grand scheme of our economy, but this does not stop the populace from using them as a reference point for the health of our system. This creates an environment rife with delusion, just as the open flood of cheap credit created considerable delusion before the crash of 2008.
Today, we find our economic fundamentals in complete disarray, but the overwhelming fantasy within stocks still remains. Why? Because yet again, for some reason, no one is ready to accept the reality that the Fed is pulling the plug on America’s fiscal life support. Nary a handful of economists in the world think that the Fed will raise interest rates one more time this year if ever again, and the threat of a balance sheet reduction is the furthest thing from everyone’s mind. Daytrading investors are utterly convinced they have the Fed by the short hairs. I say, the situation is actually in reverse.
The minutes from the Fed’s July Open Market Committee Meeting indicate that while the central bank has been the savior of stock investors for several years, the party is about to end. Comments on the risks a bull market might pose to “financial stability” have been more frequent the past couple of months
Only a few weeks ago, former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan commented that bond markets could collapse and bring stocks down with them do to overvaluations and increasing interest rates.
Recent spikes in markets despite a steady stream of natural disasters, threats of war with North Korea, as well is “increased inflation” (according to Fed models) due to the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey suggest that the Fed will indeed continue hiking rates into our ongoing financial collapse.
The next FOMC meeting will conclude on the 20th of this month, and the question is, will the Fed surprise with a rate hike and/or balance sheet reduction program? I believe the odds are much higher than many people seem to think.
First, let’s be clear, historically the Fed’s predictable behavior has been to skip major policy actions in September and then startle markets with renewed and aggressive actions in December. People placing bets on a Fed rate hike in September would look at this pattern and say “no way.” However, the narrative I see building in Fed rhetoric and in the mainstream media is that stock markets have become “unruly children” and that the Fed must become a “stern parent,” reining them in before they are crushed under the weight of their own naive enthusiasm.
In my view, the Fed will continue to do what it says it is going to do — raise interest rates and reduce and remove stimulus, and that the mainstream narrative will soon be adjusted to suggest that this is “necessary;” that stock markets need a bit of tough love.
If the Fed means to follow through with its stated plans for “financial stability” in markets, then the only measure that would be effective in shell-shocking stocks back to reality would be a surprise hike, a surprise announcement of balance sheet reduction or both at the same time.
If the Fed intends to continue cutting off life support to equities and bonds in preparation for a controlled demolition of the U.S. economy, then there is a high probability at the very least of a balance sheet reduction announcement this week with strong language indicating another rate hike in December. I also would not completely rule out a surprise rate hike even though September is usually a no-action month for central banks.
This would fit the trend of central banks around the globe strategically distancing themselves from artificial support for the financial structure. Last week, the Bank of England surprised investors with an open indication that they may begin raising interest rates “in the coming months.” The Bank Of Canada surprised some economists with yet another rate hike this month and mentions of “more to come.” The European Central Bank has paved the way for a tapering of stimulus measures according to comments made during its latest meeting early this month. And, the Bank of Japan initiated taper measures in July.
Even Forbes is admitting that there appears to be a “coordinated tightening of monetary policy” coming far sooner than the mainstream expects. If you understand how the Bank for International Settlements controls policy initiatives of national central bank members, then you should not be surprised that central banks all over the world are pursuing the same actions and the same rhetoric. The only difference between any of them is the pace they have chosen in taking the punch away from the party.
The point is, when it comes to the fiat peddlers, there are indeed a few sure things, but continued stimulus is not one of them. One thing that is certain is that they will act in concert as they are clearly doing now in terms of policy tightening. Another thing that is certain is that if they plant a notion in the mainstream media — such as the notion that they are “worried about overvaluations in stocks” and that interest rates must rise, then they will follow through as they always have. Perhaps not at the pace the mainstream expects, or the pace I expect, but certainly somewhere in-between.
Finally, it behooves me to mention again that the Fed has done all of this before. In the lead up to the stock market crash of 1929, the central bank bloated stocks with easy credit measures and low interest rates, only to hike rates in the name of “quelling inflation.” This hacked the legs out from under markets with a machete, and the rest is history. The hidden purpose behind this tactic is extraordinary centralization on a global scale. The Fed is not interested in the health of the U.S. economy, it is interested in total globalization of all economies under one totalitarian umbrella. To make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs.
Of course, the Fed will not engineer a market crash in a vacuum. It is my suspicion that the next Fed meeting will be followed by a geopolitical distraction — the most likely candidate being increasing conflict with North Korea. Do not be fooled by the magic show. The real threat to us all is the central banking and international banking apparatus, including the BIS and the IMF. From now until the end of this year, remain vigilant.

"Hillary Clinton, Obamas condemn Harvey Weinstein","Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama condemned disgraced Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein on Tuesday, marking their first public comments on the matter since reports of his alleged predatory behavior broke five days ago.
""I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,"" Clinton said in a statement through her spokesman Nick Merrill. ""The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.""
A statement from Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday evening similarly expressed disgust at Weinstein's reported actions and praised those who came forward.
""Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein,"" the statement said. ""Any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories. And we all need to build a culture -- including by empowering our girls and teaching our boys decency and respect -- so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.""
Both statements made no mention of Weinstein's sizable donations to the Clinton and Obama war chests.
Shortly after the Obamas' announcement, Democratic leadership disavowed Weinstein as well.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from Weinstein's home state of New York, said on Twitter Tuesday evening he was sending donations from Weinstein to charities based in the state.
""What Mr. Weinstein did was awful. Sending his donations to NY orgs doing crucial work for survivors & fams, @SafeHorizon @sffny & @cvtcnyc,"" Schumer tweeted.
What Mr. Weinstein did was awful. Sending his donations to NY orgs doing crucial work for survivors & fams, @SafeHorizon @sffny & @cvtcnyc. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 10, 2017
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling on accountability for ""every man who disrespects and attacks women.""
""The news of Harvey Weinstein's countless assaults on women and the clear efforts to intimidate his victims into silence are shocking,"" Pelosi's statement read. ""His despicable actions violate every standard of acceptable behavior.""
Weinstein is a longtime associate of the Clintons and a major Democratic Party donor who bundled funds for the party's political campaigns, including supporting both of Clinton's presidential bids. Weinstein was also a bundler -- someone who gathers donations from others into large sums -- for the Obama-Biden 2012 effort.
The allegations against Weinstein have renewed a debate about sexual harassment in the workplace and drawn attention to Clinton, the Democrats' 2016 standard-bearer who made the treatment of women a key plank of her presidential campaign.
Representatives for the former secretary of state and former President Bill Clinton had previously not responded to requests for comment about Weinstein, whose ties to the Clintons go back years, from the Clinton presidency to the former first lady's successful campaign for Senate.
Clinton spoke in California Monday night as part of her book tour and did not address the allegations, nor was she asked about them during the 90-minute event.
The office of former Vice President Joe Biden declined to comment.
Democrats disavow
Many Democratic office-holders quickly repudiated Weinstein, with some going so far as to send donations given by Weinstein to charity.
Clinton's former running mate, Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, said on CNN Tuesday morning that people should condemn Weinstein and said he anticipated Clinton would say something eventually.
Kaine noted Clinton has spoken out about sexual harassment often. During the campaign, Clinton spoke out about the issue and went after President Donald Trump over the allegations of sexual assault against him. Trump pushed back by touting similar allegations against her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
Early in the campaign, the former secretary of state was asked about some of those accusations and her own assertions that victims who allege assault should be believed. In the context of allegations against her husband, Clinton said, ""I would say that everyone should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.""
Clinton's condemnation Tuesday came after years of links between the Clintons, Weinstein and the Democratic Party.
In 2015, the Clintons rented a home next to Weinstein in the Hamptons, and Weinstein served as a connector between Hollywood stars and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.
Weinstein raised about $1.5 million from 1990-2016, according to data from the campaign finance-tracking Center for Responsive Politics, and was involved in fundraisers for Clinton's effort, some of which she headlined.
Prior to Tuesday's announcement, longtime Hillary Clinton aides were confused by the former secretary of state's silence on the issue, questioning -- in private -- why she had not weighed in at all.
The Obamas' ties with Weinstein were significant as well. Besides supporting Obama's 2012 presidential bid as a bundler and maintaining his role in the Democratic Party, Weinstein appeared at the White House several times for formal and informal events, and the Obamas' eldest daughter, Malia, interned at the Weinstein Company.
At a White House event for student films in 2013, first lady Michelle Obama credited Weinstein for making the event happen and praised him as a wonderful person and a good friend, and Weinstein was one of many guests at a star-studded White House birthday party for Obama in 2016.
Like Clinton, the Obamas have repeatedly addressed and condemned sexual harassment and assault.
Michelle Obama delivered a scathing speech last October, attacking Trump for having ""bragged about sexually assaulting women,"" in reference to the infamous Access Hollywood tape.
Bombshell allegations
A bombshell report in The New York Times detailed decades of sexual harassment by Weinstein, and just three days after its publication, Weinstein was fired by the company he founded.
On Tuesday, The New Yorker published a major story in which several women alleged sexual assault by Weinstein. Through his representative, Sallie Hofmeister, Weinstein denied ""any allegations of non-consensual sex.""
The reports have put Democrats under pressure to disavow Weinstein and return or donate contributions from him to charity.
Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, for example, said in a CNN interview on Sunday that Democrats should give any money they received from Weinstein back."

IRS Awards Multi-Million Dollar Fraud-Prevention Contract To Equifax Who Was Hacked TWICE,"[gard align='center']
By Aaron Kesel
You can’t make this up. The IRS awarded Equifax with a multi-million dollar fraud prevention no-bid contract despite that its own execs committed market fraud when they sold shares before telling the public they were hacked.
The IRS will pay Equifax $7.25 million to help verify taxpayer identities and prevent fraud under a no-bid contract issued last week.
The credit agency will “verify taxpayer identity” and “assist in ongoing identity verification and validations” at the IRS, according to the award.
The award describes the contract as a “sole source order,” which means Equifax is the only company held capable of providing the service. The order was issued to prevent a lapse in identity checks while officials resolve a dispute over a separate contract.
Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers bashed the IRS decision as irresponsible and horrible.
“In the wake of one of the most massive data breaches in a decade, it’s irresponsible for the IRS to turn over millions in taxpayer dollars to a company that has yet to offer a succinct answer on how at least 145 million Americans had personally identifiable information exposed,” Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told POLITICO in a statement.
“The Finance Committee will be looking into why Equifax was the only company to apply for and be rewarded with this. I will continue to take every measure possible to prevent taxpayer data from being compromised as this arrangement moves forward,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said.
Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) also expressed their distaste for the deal writing letters to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen demanding he explains why the agency awarded the contract to Equifax as well as provide information on any alternatives they may have considered.
“I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true,” Blumenauer wrote.
The IRS defended its decision in a statement, stating that Equifax told the agency that none of its data was involved in the breach and that Equifax already provides similar services to the IRS under a previous contract.
“Following an internal review and an on-site visit with Equifax, the IRS believes the service Equifax provided does not pose a risk to IRS data or systems,” the statement reads. “At this time, we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the Equifax breach, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation.”
Early last month Equifax was hacked exposing the personal information of as many as potentially 150 million Americans, which included social security numbers, birth dates, and other private information.
Afterwards three executives sold off $1.8 million dollars of the companies stock before telling the public. The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into those three Equifax executives.
Another fun fact: the identity verification systems the IRS uses are made by credit-rating agency Equifax. The system, known as Knowledge-Based Authentication, or KBA, asks questions based on a person’s credit history, such as “On which of the following streets have you lived?” or “What is your total scheduled monthly mortgage payment?”
If that’s not enough Quartz reports that in 2015, the Equifax KBA system was hacked in a data breach that resulted in the loss of more than 700,000 tax records.
Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith was put in front of congressional committee hearing this week and apologized for mistakes which led to the massive breach.
Smith additionally called for an end to Social Security numbers, claiming the country needed “to think beyond” the identifiers.
“What is a better way to identify consumers in our country in a very secure way? I think that way is something different than an SSN, a date of birth and a name,” he said, according to Bloomberg.
With two breaches under its belt including one involving an IRS system can any person state one valid reason to give Equifax a $7.25 million contract; and tell me how on earth the firm is still seen as “capable” to do the job?

Germany: 'No evidence' Kaspersky software used by Russians for hacks,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s BSI federal cyber agency said on Wednesday it had no evidence to back media reports that Russian hackers used Kaspersky Lab antivirus software to spy on U.S. authorities.
“There are no plans to warn against the use of Kaspersky products since the BSI has no evidence for misconduct by the company or weaknesses in its software,” BSI said in an emailed response to questions about the latest media reports.
“The BSI has no indications at this time that the process occurred as described in the media.”
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Israeli intelligence officials spying on Russian government hackers found they were using Kaspersky software as a sort of Google search to find sensitive data stored by U.S. government agencies and others.
It said the Russian operation also stole classified documents from a U.S. National Security Agency employee who had improperly stored them on his home computer, which had Kaspersky antivirus software installed on it.
The U.S. government last month ordered Kaspersky software removed from government computers, saying it was concerned the Moscow-based cyber security firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence.
Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, Russian hack1ing. ”Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts,” a company statement said on Tuesday in response to the New York Times report.
Germany’s BSI, which also uses Kaspersky products for technical analyses, said it was in touch with U.S. officials and other security agencies about the issue so it could take action and issue a warning on short notice if required.
It said German government agencies could use software protection for clients and servers that is offered by CANCOM online GmbH, which works together with Trend Micro (4704.T)."
Shanghai Masters: Nick Kyrgios fined for quitting match,"Nick Kyrgios received a fine of $25,000, and was suspended for eight ATP tournament weeks following his conduct at the 2016 Shanghai Masters
Nick Kyrgios has been fined $10,000 (£7,573) for unsportsmanlike conduct after he quit his first-round match at the Shanghai Masters.
Kyrgios was booed as he left the court on Tuesday after he lost the first set on a tie-break against Steve Johnson.
He had earlier received a warning for smashing two balls out of court in frustration at a line call.
The Australian has also not been allowed to collect his $21,085 (£15,967) prize money.
Kyrgios was unable to collect his prize money because he failed to get signed off for a medical afterwards to prove he was unwell or hurt.
The 13th seed had already been given a point penalty for an audible obscenity when he was heard to say he would quit against Johnson if he lost the tie-break.
After his opponent served an ace on his first set point, Kyrgios walked over to shake hands.
Umpire Fergus Murphy asked the Australian if he needed medical help before the player walked off court to boos from spectators.
At the same tournament last year he was fined for his behaviour and banned.
He later posted an apology to fans on social media, saying he had been struggling before the match with a stomach bug.
Nick Kyrgios posted this message after his Shanghai exit
The incident comes just two days after the temperamental Kyrgios lost to Rafael Nadal in the final of the China Open after becoming frustrated by a line call in the first set.
At last year's Shanghai Masters, Kyrgios argued with the umpire and a spectator during a match with Mischa Zverev. He was fined $16,500 (£13,533) for his behaviour, which included ""lack of best efforts"", and served a three-week tournament ban.
Meanwhile, British number three Kyle Edmund was beaten by Croatian fourth seed Marin Cilic in the second round in Shanghai.
The 22-year-old, who defeated Jiri Vesely 6-3 6-2 to set up the tie with the 2014 US Open champion, lost 6-3 7-6 (7-5) in one hour 37 minutes.
British number two Aljaz Bedene progressed to round two after beating Italian world number 39 Paolo Lorenzi in straight sets.
The 28-year-old won 6-1 6-4 in 73 minutes and will now face German third seed Alexander Zverev, who was given a first-round bye."

Red Sox fire manager Farrell after five seasons,"FILE PHOTO: Oct 25, 2013; St. Louis, MO, USA; Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell (53) throws during workouts a day before game three of the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports
(The Sports Xchange) - The Boston Red Sox fired manager John Farrell on Wednesday, two days after his team was eliminated from the playoffs.
Farrell, who managed the Red Sox since 2013, will not return for the 2018 season, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski announcement. The team said a search for a new manager will begin immediately.
Farrell, 55, was 432-378 (.533) in five seasons, leading the Red Sox to the World Series title in 2013. He was under contract through the end of the 2018 season.
The Red Sox were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday, losing to the Houston Astros 5-4 in Game 4 of the American League Division Series.
Boston finished 93-69 (.574) in 2017 to win its ninth AL East division title. The Red Sox had the third-best record in the American League, tied for fifth best in the majors.
During his Red Sox tenure, Farrell’s teams won three division titles (2013, 2016, 2017). His 432 managerial wins and 810 games managed both rank sixth in club history, and he is the only manager ever to lead the Red Sox to consecutive division titles.
Farrell’s first season in 2013 was highlighted by Boston’s eighth World Series championship.
Farrell began his major league managerial career with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011, leading the team to a 154-170 record over two seasons. In his seven full seasons as a manager, his clubs went 586-548 (.517).
Farrell’s first professional coaching stint began with Boston in 2007 when he spent four seasons as pitching coach. Over that four-year span, the Red Sox had three postseason appearances (2007-09), including the 2007 World Series title."

"Like May's speech, my country is a joke","Rob Crilly is a British journalist living in New York. He was The Telegraph's Afghanistan and Pakistan correspondent and was previously the East Africa correspondent for The Times of London. The opinions in this article are those of the author.
Britain is headed for the European Union with no idea of what comes next ; Theresa May, the prime minister, calls a snap election to ask the nation who should govern, and is promptly told ""not you.""
When she comes to the UN General Assembly , the annual jamboree for world leaders, she is relegated to the second day of speeches and finds herself addressing a nearly empty hall , 24 hours after Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron have had their moment in the spotlight.
Although, given the calamitous turn of events at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester Wednesday, we should probably be grateful that no one was there to see her speak at the United Nations.
Prime Minister May delivered not so much a speech as a painful metaphor for the state of Britain and the state of her leadership.
With her party in turmoil after she frittered away the Tory majority in Parliament, it was a chance to head off rivals -- such as Boris Johnson , her foreign secretary - who smell blood and are circling like sharks.
But after today, it's not sharks anymore. Now the vultures are hovering.
Theresa May's problem is that the events fit with the dominant narrative of her as a failing Prime Minister, stumbling on in power from one calamity to the next.
Let me take a moment to set the scene. The party leader's speech is one of the big set pieces of the year. For the Prime Minister, it is right up there with the Queen's Speech , when the government sets out its legislative agenda. (The address is so important that a mere commoner cannot be entrusted with it -- for good reason, as it turns out.)
For May, the Conservative Party Conference speech Wednesday was even more important. It was a chance to set the tone as lawmakers return to Parliament after their summer vacation. If ever she needed to deliver a commanding performance, this was the time.
But her voice refused to play ball. An insistent cough sabotaged her every effort, resisting gulps of water and reducing her words to a feeble croak. Never mind the pain to her larynx, this was painful on the ears.
It got worse as she tried to build to a killer line about the United Kingdom moving forward in the world: ""It's the Conservative Party that has a vision of an open, global self-confident Britain ..."" She paused, distracted as a lone figure approached the podium.
""Boris asked me to give you...."" he said, trying to hand the Prime Minister a P45 -- the letter issued when an employee leaves their job.
Get it?
May gamely carried on even as security guards hustled the man, serial prankster Simon Brodkin who goes by the name Lee Nelson, out of the hall. But the damage was done.
There will be a security investigation. How did he get in? How did he get so close to the Prime Minister?
But that's not the problem. The problem is that what might have been passed off as a bit of knockabout fun by a David Cameron or a Tony Blair, now looks like a defining moment for this Prime Minister.
We're not laughing with her but at her.
Worse still, her set disintegrated before she had finished. Two letters fell from the sign touting the conference slogan of ""Building a country that works for everyone"" -- which ended up reading ""Building a country that works or everyon.""
Of course, it wasn't her fault that she picked up a cough, was targeted by a notorious prankster and the set fell down. Many of us grapple with fear of public speaking, and May's struggles must now look like some of those nightmares come to life.
Meanwhile, there are other leaders around the world who face bigger crises at home and abroad yet seem to sail blithely on.
How she must have wished she had some rolls of paper towels on stage to lob into the audience as a distraction from the unfolding spectacle.

Some of her loyal allies did try to make the best of it.
Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said viewers would sympathize, knowing what it was like to struggle into work with a sore throat.
""Well I think she came across as very human,"" he told the BBC.
Which, with the way her year has gone so far, probably counts as a win."

The Minnesota Vikings suffered a heartbreaking loss to a division rival the Detroit Lions. Their defeat, a 14-7 loss on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium, might have come with some deadly consequences. The Vikings star rookie running back, Dalvin Cook who was drafted in the 2nd round of the 2017 NFL draft, went down early in the second half with a knee injury. He did not need crutches when he returned to the bench at the end of the game, but it’s become clear that nothing else that happened on Sunday afternoon at U.S. Bank Stadium could have as much effect on the Vikings’ season as Dalvin Cook’s health. As reported by the Star Tribune, His injury sent Vikings fans home in a sour mood, on a day where they’d spent plenty of time excoriating referees for a lack of calls against Lions defensive backs. The Vikings fear Cook suffered an injury to his left anterior cruciate ligament, according to head coach Mike Zimmer. “We’re concerned about his ACL but he’s going to get an MRI in the morning and we’ll find out,” Zimmer said, adding: “If you lose a guy like him, you lose a lot of firepower.” The loss, dropped the …

"Amid Catalan Crisis, Thousands Hold Rallies in Madrid and Barcelona","The vote, which had been declared illegal by the Spanish constitutional court, devolved into violent clashes between voters and the Spanish national police, who attempted to stop it. Hundreds were injured, including police officers.

More than 40 percent of Catalan voters took part, with 90 percent casting ballots backing independence.
That led the Catalan regional president, Carles Puigdemont, to announce that he had a mandate to help push through a unilateral declaration of independence in the coming days.
In response, the constitutional court barred the Catalan Parliament from meeting on Monday, in an apparent effort to stop regional lawmakers from debating the issue.
“No government in the world” could tolerate the threatening of its unity, said Spain’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, in an interview with the newspaper El País published late Saturday night. He asserted that he could not allow Catalonia to break away, saying “it won’t happen.”
Another demonstration is set for Barcelona on Sunday to express opposition to the Catalan drive for independence.
After the referendum vote and the clashes that followed, the Spanish king, Felipe VI, made a rare televised speech to condemn the Catalan leaders.

Three Catalan businesses — the banks Sabadell and Caixabank, as well as the energy company Gas Natural — announced that they were moving their head offices to other parts of Spain.

Throughout the past week, people in Barcelona have held demonstrations in support of independence, while those in Madrid have gathered in opposition. But Rita Maestre, a spokeswoman for the local government in Madrid, said that most of the rallies on Saturday were “proof that between the noise of the polarized extremes there is a large part of the population that wants dialogue.”
Demonstrators in Barcelona carried banners with handwritten slogans such as “Let’s talk!” It was written in both Spanish and Catalan. One called on Mr. Puigdemont and Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, “to go for a beer.”

“I don’t believe in flags or nationalism because it makes hate and wars,” said Reyes Rodriguez, 25, a publicist in Barcelona. “So I’m here to call for dialogue.”
Ms. Rodriguez said Catalans should be able to hold a legal referendum in the future, but argued that the turnout for the Oct. 1 vote had not given Mr. Puigdemont a mandate to push for a declaration of independence.
“A lot of people stayed at home because they felt the vote was illegal and they didn’t believe in it,” Ms. Rodriguez said.

Sergi Miquel, a lawmaker from Mr. Puigdemont’s center-right party, the Catalan European Democratic Party, said the turnout at the referendum would have been far higher had the police not acted so violently against voters.
“Some people were afraid, I’m sure, and some people could not vote,” Mr. Miquel said, because the police would not let them.
Representatives of the independence movement said they hoped that Mr. Puigdemont would follow through with his promise to secede.

Further dialogue is pointless, said Benet Salellas, a member of the Catalan Parliament and a representative of the Popular Unity Candidacy, a far-left group.
“The Spanish kingdom does not want to talk with us and so the only way for the Spanish kingdom to be forced into dialogue with us is to make a declaration of independence,” Mr. Salellas said.
The Spanish government had no interest in allowing a legal referendum, leaving Catalonia with no other choice but to secede, Mr. Salellas added.
“It’s impossible,” he said. “We tried, I think, 16 times, asking by letter, going to the Spanish Parliament, going to the Spanish constitutional court. In all the ways you can imagine we asked for an agreement for a referendum, and the Spanish state always said no.”"

Hill Russia investigators: Panel still searching for 'any hint of collusion',"(CNN) Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said Wednesday that the panel ""has more work to do"" to determine whether there was collusion between Russian officials and Donald Trump's team during last year's presidential election.
""The committee continues to look into all evidence to see if there was any hint of collusion,"" Burr said at a Capitol Hill news conference, standing alongside the committee's top Democrat, Mark Warner of Virginia.
Burr said the committee continues to look for ""any hint of collusion"" but has not come to any initial conclusions on that question, as it is still conducting interviews and reviewing documents, including 25 additional interviews this month.
The news conference Burr and Warner held to provide a progress report on their monthslong probe underscored their investigation is growing in scope and is not shying away from the question of collusion — which Trump has repeatedly dismissed as a ""hoax.""
Burr and Warner said they have largely confirmed the conclusions the intelligence community reached under the Obama administration that the Russian government meddled in the 2016 US election.
While Burr sidestepped questions about whether the Russians were trying to help Trump, one of the conclusions the intelligence community found, he warned that the efforts to interfere are still ongoing and must be addressed ahead of the next round of US elections later this year and in 2018.
""We have not come to any determination on collusion or Russia's preferences,"" the North Carolina Republican said. ""It seems that the overall theme of the Russian involvement in the US elections was to create chaos at every level. And I would tell you the fact that we're sitting here nine months later investigating it, they have been pretty darn successful.""
Burr said he did not have a timeline on when the investigation will conclude, though he said somewhat wistfully that his ""aspirational goal"" was still to end by the end of year.
Burr ticked off the areas of possible collusion the committee had already probed, and also issued a blanket threat to future witnesses that they should testify voluntarily or face a subpoena.
""Future witnesses that we might ask to come in the future, I strongly suggest you come in and speak with us,"" Burr said. ""If we believe that you have something valuable to bring to the committee, if you don't voluntarily do it, I will assure you today you will be compelled to do it.""
He noted the committee had ""hit a wall"" in its effort to interview Christopher Steele , the author of a controversial dossier containing explosive allegations about Trump and top members of his campaign, and he called on Steele to meet with the panel.
Burr said that both he and Warner made personal efforts to reach Steele, but he had not accepted their invitations. Burr said the committee ""cannot decide the credibility"" of the dossier without understanding who paid for it and its sources.
CNN reported in early January t hat Trump was briefed on the dossier, which includes allegations about Trump's associates, finances and personal life, and Trump has gone on to dismiss its contents entirely as ""phony.""
Burr also said the panel had interviewed seven attendees of an April 2016 event at the Mayflower Hotel -- where then-Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak spoke briefly with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- and their testimony was consistent. The panel also talked to everyone involved with the changing of the Republican platform on Ukraine, and Burr said the staff believed in what they were implementing.
Burr said the committee's examination of the memos of former FBI Director James Comey ""has reached a logical end as it relates to the Russia investigation,"" indicating the committee didn't plan to delve further into the question of obstruction of justice, something Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating.
Burr and Warner brought a chart to the news conference that detailed the amount of work the committee has done so far, including more than 100 interviews at over 250 hours, more than 4,000 transcript pages and 100,000 pages of documents reviewed.
Burr said the committee has interviewed every intelligence community official involved in drafting the report on Russian election meddling, as well as Obama administration officials involved.
The committee has spoken behind closed doors to members of the intelligence community as well as Trump's inner circle, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Kushner.
There are several public hearings on the horizon. The first is for Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who had been scheduled for a private staff interview last month, but the committee postponed the appearance and invited him to a public session instead after Cohen provided a statement to the media denying any collusion with Russian officials.
The Senate intelligence panel has also invited Facebook, Twitter and Google to testify at a public hearing next month on Russia's use of social media in elections, which has become a major focus of the panel's probe in recent weeks.
Facebook on Monday provided Congress with copies of the 3,000 Russian-linked election ads it identified, as well as data including where the ads were targeted. CNN reported Tuesday that the ads targeted crucial swing states Wisconsin and Michigan
The Senate intelligence committee is one of three congressional panels that are investigating Russian election meddling and possible collusion, in addition to Mueller's investigation.

Brazil's Meirelles has hired media team ahead of 2018 election: sources,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles has hired social media experts to boost his image ahead of the 2018 election, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday, the strongest sign yet that the former banker is seriously eyeing a run for president.
Meirelles hired analysts linked to the Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV) think tank to study his social media presence on a daily basis and build a communication plan, said one of the sources. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
They have been working for Meirelles for more than three months, two of the sources said.
The Finance Ministry’s press office declined comment on Meirelles behalf.
The finance minister’s potential candidacy adds to political uncertainty ahead of a presidential election marked by a strong anti-establishment climate and a lack of clear favorites.
Meirelles, praised by investors for leading a market-friendly agenda of economic reforms, would have to leave his post by April, six months before the election, and could face a wide field of competitive candidates in a first-round vote.
One of the analysts hired by Meirelles works alongside the ministry’s official communication team in Brasilia, although the FGV team has not received any public funds for supporting his potential candidacy, two of the sources said.
The team includes Thomas Traumann, a former spokesman for impeached President Dilma Rousseff, according one of the sources and another person familiar with the matter.
Traumann confirmed to Reuters that he had consulted for Meirelles under private contract since 2015, but he did not work for the Finance Ministry. He declined to comment on potential preparations for next year’s presidential race.
The Finance Ministry said FGV has offered consultancy on social media to the ministry as part of a 40-year-long initiative of institutional support, without any connection to the 2018 campaign.
A ministry spokeswoman, who asked not to be named in accordance with ministry policy, said it had no relationship with Traumann.
FGV said it had not signed a contract with the Finance Ministry or Meirelles.
Reuters reported late in August, citing a source close to Meirelles, that Meirelles wanted to run for president but knew he would have a strong chance only if the economy improved substantially after two years of recession.
Congressmen from his Social Democratic Party (PSD) last month heard from Meirelles that he felt honored to have his name floated as a potential candidate.
Other potential candidates from within President Michel Temer’s fragmented coalition include the governor of Sao Paulo state, Geraldo Alckmin, and Sao Paulo Mayor Joao Doria.
Meirelles opened a Twitter account in June to publicize his actions as minister and has recently left the door open for a potential candidacy, saying he would take a decision on the race by April. About 2 percent of voters have declared their intention to vote for him, according to a recent Datafolha poll.
A civil engineer by training, Meirelles is the former president of BankBoston, which was eventually acquired by Bank of America Corp, and a former president of Brazil’s central bank."
Adding Words To Syrian Witness' Statement To Fit Western Narrative,"By Brandon Turbeville
Although the entirety of the Western corporate media machine is worthy of the name “Fake News,” CNN has become the standard bearer of the title. It seems that the organization is doing everything in its power to earn its position as the tip of the spear in the army of “fake news.” Indeed, it is scarcely possible to keep up with the lies, deceit, and half-truths CNN presents to the general public on a daily basis. Occasionally, however, one instance stands out so much that it cannot be allowed to slip by without being addressed.
Back in 2016, as Aleppo was the scene of a fierce battle between America’s terrorist forces and the Syrian military, CNN broadcasted a report from Jibrin, Syria where it purported to show the sad state of civilians fleeing the war that had come to Aleppo. The clip shows two Syrians – one young boy and an older man – who are telling the reporter about their situation.
The CNN reporter predictably attributes the horrors facing the civilians as a result of the eastern part of Aleppo “being under siege by the Syrian military,” not the fact that terrorists had seized east Aleppo and were fighting to the death to keep it. Still he quotes an older man who paints a less than typical CNN-style portrayal of the “rebels.” The man says, “I wanted to leave with my kids fifteen days ago but the rebels shot at me and said ‘Hey you bastard! Do you want to join the regime?’”
The only thing surprising about the man’s statement was that it was actually aired on CNN.
However, the most interesting aspect of the report is what was attributed to the young boy whom CNN quotes as saying, “We were afraid that we would starve to death. We were also scared because heavy bombs were falling.”
This quote makes the boy seem as if he is worried because of the Syrian military’s bombs. However, the translation is not only inaccurate, the second half is completely fabricated. The boy’s actual statement is “We were afraid that we would starve to death. We were afraid that we would starve to death.” Even to a non-Arabic speaker, one can clearly hear that the boy is merely repeating his first statement a second time. He says nothing about bombs. CNN simply added it to the translation for political and propaganda purposes.
While civilians on the ground were no doubt worried about the bombs of the Syrian military (bombs kill regardless of who drops them) they were even more afraid of living under the unimaginable tyranny of America’s terrorists. Still, CNN has gone much further than simply bending the truth to fit a narrative, it has obviously told a complete and total lie. It has put words in the mouths of its interview subjects and passed it off as the truth. At best, this is a violation of journalistic ethics. More realistic, however, it is an act of willful deceit and an attempt to mold the minds of the general public for political purposes.
At this point, CNN cannot be taken seriously as even a second rate news organization. It is clearly nothing more than a propaganda mouthpiece for State Department and other interests. Unfortunately for CNN, even operating as a propaganda organ, it is only second rate.

Equifax Exposed: Major Breach of Data from Major Credit Bureau,"Equifax Exposed: Major Breach of Data from Major Credit Bureau
(Before It's News)
http://robertsiciliano.com/
If you haven’t yet heard, Equifax, one of the three major credit bureaus in the United States, has been hacked. What does this mean for you? It means that your Social Security number, and possibly even your driver’s license information, could be in the hands of hackers. Some are already calling this the worst breach of data in history.
How Did This Happen?
On September 7th, Equifax announced that a security breach occurred that could impact as many as 143 million people. Though this isn’t the largest breach to occur, it could be the most devastating. The data that was accessed included Social Security numbers, address, birth dates, and driver’s license numbers. All of these can be used for identity theft.
Equifax also announced that the credit card numbers of more than 200,000 people were accessed, as were documents containing personal identifying information for more than 180,000 people. With this information, the hackers can commit credit card fraud. This isn’t as bad as identity theft, as credit card fraud is usually simple to fix, but these thieves could still open new credit card accounts in your name with your Social.
According to Equifax, the company discovered the data breach on July 29. Apparently, the hackers accessed the files from around mid-May all the way through July.
Richard F. Smith, the chairman and CEO of Equifax, admits that this is a “disappointing event” and that it “strikes at the heart” of the goals of the company. He also apologized to customers who work with Equifax and consumers. Boo hoo. I cry for you.
Why Did It Take So Long to Announce This?
You might be wondering why it took so long to announce that there was a data breach at Equifax. After all, the company discovered it on July 29, and didn’t announce it until September 7. Their Director of Social Media, has an answer. She said that as soon as the company discovered the breach, they stopped the intrusion. The company also hired a cybersecurity firm, which did a full investigation. This investigation was time consuming, and they wanted to have all of the information available before informing the public. Makes sense.
But Wait…There’s More
To add to this story, Bloomberg News announced that three executives from Equifax sold shares worth about $1.8 million. What’s shocking is that they did this AFTER the company discovered the breach. This will come back to bite them.
You can check to see if you are affected by the breach by using an online tool that Equifax has set up. FYI, I checked out my info, I’m a victim.
You should go there, enter your last name and the last six digits of your Social Security number, and the system will tell you if your information has been compromised. If it has, Equifax is offering a complimentary enrollment into the TrustedID program. However, there is language in the terms of service that may restrict your ability to have your day in court if you were to join a class action and the NY Attorney General is pissed. According to USA Today, a class action lawsuit has already been filed against Equifax. This class action suit seeks to secure all records associated with the breach and fair compensation for those who were affected.
Read the NYT.
You don’t have to have done any type of business with Equifax to be affected by this. If you have ever applied for a mortgage, loan, or credit card, the company likely has your information. The TrustedID program is going to be free for an entire year for anyone affected. It gives consumers the ability to lock and unlock their credit reports. They also get internet scans for their Social Security numbers and identity-theft insurance. You can also call Equifax at 866-447-7559.

The Last Jedi trailer: Four big questions we want the answers to,"Image copyright Lucasfilm Image caption Will Daisy Ridley's Rey use the Force for good or evil?
The first full trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi does its job brilliantly - it teases galaxy-rattling plot lines while leaving you unsure about whether what you think will happen is what is actually going to happen.
On top of that, there are the ""oohs"" of spectacular battle scenes combined with the ""ahhs"" of some new cute fluffy creatures.
We also see Carrie Fisher in some of her final shots as General Leia, filmed before her death last Christmas.
Above all, it raises some big questions about what might unfold in the Star Wars universe.
These might be spoilers. They might not. We're not sure yet.
Skip Twitter post by @Caboose_XBL It feels like that #TheLastJedi trailer was cut to make me *think* I've seen major plot points...at least I hope that's what's going on... — Eren - CabooseXBL (@Caboose_XBL) October 10, 2017 Report
Will Rey go to the Dark Side?

""When I found you, I saw raw, untamed power. And beyond that... something truly special.""
Those are the opening, growling words from Snoke, Andy Serkis's Supreme Leader of the First Order, who we see properly for the first time.
Is he talking about Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is in some of the opening shots? Or is he actually talking about Rey (Daisy Ridley), who the trailer then cuts to?
Image copyright Lucasfilm
She's seen learning to harness the Force on Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) island retreat.
""I've seen this raw strength only once before,"" he intones, looking pretty petrified, apparently comparing Rey to Ren. ""It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.""
At the end of the trailer, we see Snoke apparently torturing Rey before she says: ""I need someone to show me my place in all this.""
It looks like she's talking to Ren. He offers his hand. Clever trailer editing? Or do they really join forces?

""That's the only way to become what you're meant to be,"" he adds.
Leia is silent but furrowed of brow, as you might look if you fear you might be killed by your son.
Kylo's thumb hovers above the big red button. He quivers and gulps, as you might if you might be about to kill your mother.

IRS Awards Multi-Million Dollar Fraud-Prevention Contract To Equifax Who Was Hacked TWICE,"By Aaron Kesel
You can’t make this up. The IRS awarded Equifax with a multi-million dollar fraud prevention no-bid contract despite that its own execs committed market fraud when they sold shares before telling the public they were hacked.
The IRS will pay Equifax $7.25 million to help verify taxpayer identities and prevent fraud under a no-bid contract issued last week.
The credit agency will “verify taxpayer identity” and “assist in ongoing identity verification and validations” at the IRS, according to the award.
The award describes the contract as a “sole source order,” which means Equifax is the only company held capable of providing the service. The order was issued to prevent a lapse in identity checks while officials resolve a dispute over a separate contract.
Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers bashed the IRS decision as irresponsible and horrible.
“In the wake of one of the most massive data breaches in a decade, it’s irresponsible for the IRS to turn over millions in taxpayer dollars to a company that has yet to offer a succinct answer on how at least 145 million Americans had personally identifiable information exposed,” Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told POLITICO in a statement.
“The Finance Committee will be looking into why Equifax was the only company to apply for and be rewarded with this. I will continue to take every measure possible to prevent taxpayer data from being compromised as this arrangement moves forward,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said.
Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) also expressed their distaste for the deal writing letters to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen demanding he explains why the agency awarded the contract to Equifax as well as provide information on any alternatives they may have considered.
“I was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the Onion, until I realized this story was, in fact, true,” Blumenauer wrote.
The IRS defended its decision in a statement, stating that Equifax told the agency that none of its data was involved in the breach and that Equifax already provides similar services to the IRS under a previous contract.
“Following an internal review and an on-site visit with Equifax, the IRS believes the service Equifax provided does not pose a risk to IRS data or systems,” the statement reads. “At this time, we have seen no indications of tax fraud related to the Equifax breach, but we will continue to closely monitor the situation.”
Early last month Equifax was hacked exposing the personal information of as many as potentially 150 million Americans, which included social security numbers, birth dates, and other private information.
Afterwards three executives sold off $1.8 million dollars of the companies stock before telling the public. The Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into those three Equifax executives.
Another fun fact: the identity verification systems the IRS uses are made by credit-rating agency Equifax. The system, known as Knowledge-Based Authentication, or KBA, asks questions based on a person’s credit history, such as “On which of the following streets have you lived?” or “What is your total scheduled monthly mortgage payment?”
If that’s not enough Quartz reports that in 2015, the Equifax KBA system was hacked in a data breach that resulted in the loss of more than 700,000 tax records.
Former Equifax CEO Richard Smith was put in front of congressional committee hearing this week and apologized for mistakes which led to the massive breach.
Smith additionally called for an end to Social Security numbers, claiming the country needed “to think beyond” the identifiers.
“What is a better way to identify consumers in our country in a very secure way? I think that way is something different than an SSN, a date of birth and a name,” he said, according to Bloomberg.
With two breaches under its belt including one involving an IRS system can any person state one valid reason to give Equifax a $7.25 million contract; and tell me how on earth the firm is still seen as “capable” to do the job?

Prevent Terrorists From Getting American Guns,"Prevent Terrorists From Getting American Guns
(Before It's News)
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
By Sam Bocetta
In order to stop the threat of ISIS in Southeast Asia, the US government must take measures to cut off ISIS’ access to firearms from the United States. A few days ago, Reuters reported that the Trump administration is preparing legislation that would make it easier for American gun manufacturers to sell weapons abroad. Aides are supposedly preparing to shift oversight of non-military firearms from the State Department to the Commerce Department. This development is worrying because at present ISIS – and other terror groups – partially rely on US-made weapons to arm their members. A major portion of ISIS’ growth in recent years has occurred in the Philippines, where it has become more active and caused chaos, culminating in a recent attack on Marawi. One of the reasons it has done more damage is its ability to acquire more powerful weapons and deliver them to militias through its supply lines, and this process is reliant on the group’s ability to legally acquire US-made weapons. Making it easier to do so is not a good idea. How ISIS Spread into the Philippines The island of Mindanao, which is in the Southern Philippines, is where ISIS has made most of its moves …

Ravens Won’t Back Down,"Ravens Won’t Back Down
(Before It's News)
The Ravens are a mess. I’ve written about this before much to the chagrin of diehard fans. But sometimes the truth hurts and one look at Marty Mornhinweg’s anemic offense is all the reminder you’ll ever need.
Sure, injuries have played a role. How much better would the offense be if the Ravens had Marshal Yanda, Alex Lewis and Nico Siragusa across the offensive front? How much better might the running game be if Kenneth Dixon was available? How much better might the rapport be between new receiver Jeremy Maclin and Joe Flacco if the Ravens quarterback was available during training camp and the preseason?
Think of the defense with Tavon Young, Zach Orr and Brent Urban.
The losses have been brutal, but that’s life in the NFL. It is what it is and teams have no choice but to move forward and try to get better with each practice. It sounds cliché-ish, but really, what else can they do, quit four games into the season. John Harbaugh’s teams have been a lot of things since Super Bowl 47, many of them not so good. But one thing they’ve always been is gritty and resilient.
They won’t back down and possess a very solid, collective work ethic, one that Harbaugh hopes will propel improvement.
“We just have to improve. You’re not going to make a bunch of changes; you just have to improve. There were some flashes in there, and we have to build on those things. It’s a process. You have to go to work, and you work to improve. We have playmakers out there, and we can put the ball in peoples’ hands. We can run the ball – we’ve shown that. We have to eliminate the mistakes and make more plays.” ~ John Harbaugh
The good news for the Ravens is that they are only 1 game behind the Steelers in the AFCN, a team that really hasn’t been all that impressive nor has the rest of the league for that matter. Take a look around. The league is a mess!
The Chiefs sport the NFL’s best record with a perfect (4-0). They stand alone. Besides the Steelers, other division leaders include the Eagles, Lions, Panthers, Rams, Bills and Jaguars. None are without flaws. None are immune from injuries.
This week the Ravens travel to Oakland to take on a (2-2) Raiders team that will be without its quarterback, Derek Carr. Last season the Raiders were (12-3) with Carr, (0-2) without him. It’s a big loss.
What will be the Ravens record at the halfway point of the 2017 season 6-2 5-3 4-4 3-5 2-6 View Result Total votes: 0 6-2 (0 votes, 0%) 5-3 (0 votes, 0%) 4-4 (0 votes, 0%) 3-5 (0 votes, 0%) 2-6 (0 votes, 0%) Vote
Next week the Ravens return home to M&T Bank Stadium where they’ll host the Bears who announced that rookie signal caller Mitch Trubisky will be behind center. Under John Harbaugh the Ravens are (9-0) against first-year quarterbacks. After that it’s the Vikings on the road who will be without RB Dalvin Cook and possibly QB Sam Bradford. Then it’s home for Thursday Night Football against Jay Cutler and the Dolphins.
In a league where the only certain thing is uncertainty, these four games, despite the Ravens struggles, are all very winnable, assuming the Ravens make John Harbaugh’s hopes become a reality.

"U.S. President Donald Trump Quietly Signs Law To Allow Warrantless Searches In Parts Of VA, DC and MD","By Aaron Kesel
As former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said: “You never let a serious crisis go to waste.” While everyone was worried about the hurricanes, U.S. President Donald Trump signed away the Fourth Amendment buried in a new bill. He set a precedent by empowering the police state to allow warrantless searches in parts of VA, MD and D.C. near the Metro train system.
The government can now openly enter and search private property without a warrant in parts of Virginia, Maryland and D.C.
The House Joint Resolution 76 was signed into law on Tuesday, Aug. 22, by President Trump. The text is rather boring, starting off with: “Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.”
CNN explained, “This law lets Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia form a new panel called the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to oversee the safety of the D.C.-area public transportation Metro train system.”
The new safety commission will take over from the current Federal Transit Agency (FTA), which has been in charge of safety oversight for the Washington Metropolitan Area Interstate Compact (WMATA) since October 2015.
“We’ll set this up and get the FTA out of Metro. They are happy to get out, and we’re happy to get them out,” Metro Board of Directors Chair Jack Evans told Bloomberg BNA. “I’m glad we got this thing. If nothing else, we’ll get our money.”
However, buried within the bill’s text is a daunting “one major red flag” that would give the newly formed commission “the authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System ‘without limitation’ and without a warrant, for the purpose of ‘making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing,” The Free Thought Project reported.
The legislation reads:
In performing its duties, the Commission, through its Board or designated employees or agents, may: Enter upon the WMATA Rail System and, upon reasonable notice and a finding by the chief executive officer that a need exists, upon any lands, waters, and premises adjacent to the WMATA Rail System, including, without limitation, property owned or occupied by the federal government, for the purpose of making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing as the Commission may deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this MSC Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass.
Only five Congressman voted against the bill according to U.S. Rep Justin Amash (R-Mich.) while three hundred ninety-nine gave their approval, and 29 didn’t bother to vote at all. Apparently, our elected officials can’t be bothered to stand up for the rights of we the people or the Constitution they swore to protect. After all, the Fourth Amendment doesn’t exist, which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures or anything. As Amash pointed out, the government will now be able to kick in the doors of any private property surrounding the border of the DC Metro Rail System without needing a warrant based on any probable cause.
Only 5 of us voted against bill allowing govt to enter/search private property in parts of VA, MD & DC w/o warrant. https://t.co/SVhTWqbPaB — Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2017 FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad)
A scary prospect indeed, as Rachel Blevins wrote for The Free Thought Project, “While it may only affect the Washington, D.C., metro area now, it could be laying the blueprint for future legislation across the country.”

The New York Yankees continued their remarkable season by taking the A.L. wild-card game on Tuesday night 8-4 over the Minnesota Twins. The Bronx Bombers were able to overcome an early three-run hole in the first inning when starting pitcher Luis Severino stunk out the joint and was given the hook by manager Joe Girardi after allowing four hits. Yankees pitching then settled down and the sluggers did the rest. After a rough first inning, the @Yankees needed to break out the bats. And boy, they sure did. https://t.co/8WjK6yAqxU #WinningTogether pic.twitter.com/aUYct9vFzn — MLB (@MLB) October 4, 2017 On a potent team the likes of New York, no deficit is insurmountable and this is especially the case with an early one and with the other team having their own shaky pitcher on the mound. The Yanks quickly jumped on Ervin Santana and thanks to shortstop Didi Gregorius smacking a 3-run homer, were able to survive the early scare and exit the first inning tied at three. The bullpen – forced into action early after Severino’s implosion – held the Twins to just one run the rest of the way and Yanks’ hitters came through with two more homers including rookie sensation …

Carrefour Brasil opens online grocery shopping in Sao Paulo,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Grupo Carrefour Brasil will start an online grocery shopping and rewards platform in Sao Paulo this week, executives said on Monday, deploying fresh capital to boost its e-commerce presence in a fiercely competitive market.
The Brazilian unit of French retailer Carrefour SA, which raised 5 billion reais ($1.6 billion) in a July IPO, will offer the services over mobile app “Meu Carrefour,” which will slowly expand beyond an initial 200 neighborhoods in Brazil’s biggest city.
Carrefour executives told journalists that online food orders would be delivered to buyers’ doorsteps from a distribution center in southwest Sao Paulo that executives called their pilot “dark store.”
Daniel Viana, head of food e-commerce for Carrefour Brasil, said the first dark store is modest in size, but the company will likely expand its delivery operations if the pilot proves successful.
The company aims to issue around 100 million coupons per month over the new app once it ramps up. Carrefour Brasil has 4 million users registered on current online platforms, said Jose Luis Gutierrez, vice-president of retail for Carrefour Brasil.
Traditional retailers have looked increasingly to e-commerce platforms and non-traditional pick-up formats in recent years in Brazil to maintain sales amid prolonged economic weakness.
In 2015, food retailer GPA, which is controlled by Carrefour rival Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, launched a service to allow buyers to shop online and then go to a store to physically pick up purchased items."
Premier League: Clubs 'risk bankruptcy' with promotion,"Hull City celebrate winning the Championship play-off final at Wembley in May 2016
English Football League clubs risk bankruptcy by chasing promotion to the Premier League, financial experts say.
Between the 2008-09 and 2015-16 seasons, 19 clubs entered the top flight, and only one - Crystal Palace - avoided making a loss.
Average losses in their promotion seasons were more than £300,000 per week, financial data firm Vysyble said.
But the English Football League (EFL) said such reports ""confuse the reality of the situation for supporters"".
Most of the promoted clubs made money in their first Premier League season, but after four years just one in four was still in the black, according to Vysyble's report.
One in three was immediately relegated and two in three were down again within three years.
The report describes the ""economic exhaustion"" of trying to compete with the more established Premier League clubs.
Report co-author Roger Bell said many fans and owners of EFL clubs see promotion to the top flight as a ""golden ticket to untold riches"" but in reality trying to stay in the Premier League is ""ultimately loss-making"".
This ""financial over-exertion"" can lead to long-term problems, Bell continued, which cannot be solved by parachute payments to relegated sides, even though they can now total more than £90m.
""EFL clubs who spend beyond their means are, in fact, risking their futures by chasing a dream that is just that, a dream, and one that is actually more likely to end up as a financial nightmare,"" Bell added.
An EFL spokesman said it is ""one of the most competitive competitions in world football"" and is in a ""strong financial position"".
Promotion to the Premier League can be ""financially exhausting"" for some clubs, according to the report
""Reports of this nature inflame the position and confuse the reality of the situation for supporters,"" he said.
Citing financial fair play rules introduced in 2012, the league's improved revenues, and solidarity payments from the Premier League, the EFL spokesman said no club had been through an insolvency process for several years.
He added football is a ""competitive industry"", where progress up the league pyramid is the main goal, but said the EFL's rules are under regular review as its clubs ""clearly face different financial challenges to those in the Premier League"".
The Premier League declined to comment on the report.
It is understood that some of the 19 promoted clubs would have broken even but for player bonuses triggered by those successes.
Bell believes his report has highlighted the risks associated with pushing too hard for promotion, particularly when the Premier League is split on how future broadcasting revenue is shared.
""Owners who accept the risk of relegation but also preserve the balance sheet face much better prospects if the club is indeed relegated, with Burnley, Norwich and Newcastle proving to be excellent examples,"" he said."

Can Giants QB Eli Manning Have a Bounce Back Season for Big Blue?,"Can Giants QB Eli Manning Have a Bounce Back Season for Big Blue?
(Before It's News)
USA Today Sports
Many fans are looking for Giants quarterback Eli Manning to have a big 2017, as last season he threw 9 less touchdowns and two more interceptions than he did in 2015.
Sure he led the Giants to the postseason, but he just didn’t play as well as he did in 2015, when he threw 35 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, putting up a QB rating of 93.6.
Now at 36 years old, it’s a time where Manning has to prove it all over again that he can get the job done. Today NJ.com reported about Manning, and the feeling is he will have a big season for Big Blue.
The Giants believe Manning is due for a bounce-back season. They need it from him if they’re going to contend for a Super Bowl. But then again, they were right there in the mix last year when he was playing poorly most weeks. The Giants’ influx of offensive weapons should help Manning as long as the line is somewhat able to protect him. But Manning is 36, and quarterbacks can begin to fall off a cliff at this point in their career.

Shanghai Masters: Rafael Nadal & Roger Federer through; Aljaz Bedene retires,"Roger Federer has won 93 ATP titles - only Ivan Lendl (94) and Jimmy Connors (109) have won more
Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer both registered straightforward victories to move into the third round of the Shanghai Masters.
World number one Nadal needed just 54 minutes to beat America's Jared Donaldson 6-2 6-1.
Federer, chasing his 94th ATP title, found his rhythm as the match progressed to beat Argentine Diego Schwartzman 7-6 (7-4) 6-4.
Nadal plays Fabio Fognini next, while Federer faces Alexandr Dolgopolov.
Nadal, who leads world number two Federer in the rankings by 2,370 points, did not face a break point as he raced to victory over Donaldson.
Federer took a little longer to find his rhythm but 38 winners ensured his place in the second round.
Earlier, Britain's Aljaz Bedene was forced to retire from his second-round match against Germany's Alexander Zverev with a knee injury.
Bedene, ranked 48th in the world, was trailing 4-0 when he ended the match after just 12 minutes on court.
It is the second time in two weeks that Bedene has retired mid-match, and the seventh time in his career.
World number four Zverev will go on to play Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro in the third round."

South Africa to restock Chad with black rhinos,"FILE PHOTO: Rhinos are seen at the Mafikeng Game Reserve in South Africa's North West province, November 11, 2010. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa will relocate six endangered black rhinos to Chad where the animal was hunted to local extinction decades ago, the environment ministry in Pretoria said.
If the experiment is successful, the central African nation will host the most northerly wild population of black rhinos in Africa. This could pave the way for the species to be reintroduced to other parts of its former continental range from which it was exterminated due to poaching.
“A team of experts from South Africa will visit Chad to assess the habitat, security and management suitability and associated ecological parameters as well as infrastructural readiness prior to the translocation,” South Africa’s environment ministry said in a statement.
A date for the relocation has not been set yet.
The rhinos’ destination will be Zakouma National Park in the southeast of Chad, an impoverished oil-producer. Found just south of the Sahara Desert, Zakouma is home to a recovering elephant population of several hundred and is managed by the African Parks Foundation, a conservation NGO.

Africa has two rhino species of which the white rhino is the larger and more numerous of the two. The black rhino is famed for its ornery disposition and is far more apt to charge at any perceived threat.
Black rhinos have not roamed Chad since the early 1970s and the species has been eliminated from much of its original range in the face of relentless poaching.
The move comes against the backdrop of an unfolding rhino poaching crisis in South Africa, home to most of the world’s population of the bulky pachyderms.
The number of rhinos poached for their horns in South Africa fell 10 percent in 2016 to 1,054, the second straight year of decline according to government data, but conservationists say the levels remain alarming.
Rhino poaching rates in South Africa had surged from 83 in 2008 to a record 1,215 in 2014 to meet red-hot demand in newly-affluent Asian countries such as Vietnam, where the horn is prized as a key ingredient in traditional medicines.
South Africa has more than 80 percent of the world’s rhino population with about 18,000 white rhinos and close to 2,000 black rhinos, which is why it has been at the frontline of the horn poaching crisis.

REUTERS/Alexandros Avramidis
ATHENS (Reuters) - A Greek court on Wednesday backed the extradition to Moscow of a Russian citizen who also faces being sent to the United States on allegations of laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin.
Alexander Vinnik, the suspected mastermind of a $4 billion bitcoin laundering ring, is one of seven Russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on U.S. cybercrime charges.
Judges ruled last week that he should be extradited to the United States, a decision Russia criticized as unjust and illegal and which Vinnik is challenging at Greece’s supreme court.
Should it decide to uphold the ruling to extradite him to the United States, the final decision is in the hands of Greece’s justice minister, who can approve extradition to one country and block the other.
Vinnik denies all charges against him. But he has agreed to be returned to Russia where he is to be tried on lesser fraud charges.

“That is his wish - to be extradited to Russia and to give his account before the Russian judicial authorities,” Alexandros Lykourezos, the lawyer leading Vinnik’s defense, told reporters after the ruling in Thessaloniki.

In the United States, where he faces up to 55 years in prison, Vinnik is accused of running BTC-e -- a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin -- to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011.
He has told Greek judges that he was a technical consultant to BTC-e and not its operator.
Vinnik was arrested while on holiday in a seaside village in Greece in July. Russia then sought his extradition as it has done with other nationals wanted by the United States.
The supreme court hearing is expected within the next three weeks, Lykourezos said."
How can US rapist win joint custody of victim's child?,"Image copyright Michigan Department of Corrections Image caption Christopher Mirasolo is a registered sex offender who assaulted another underage victim
The case of a Michigan man awarded joint legal custody of a child whose mother he sexually assaulted when she was 12 has provoked outrage.
Many are incredulous that Christopher Mirasolo, 27, could be granted parental rights after a DNA test established his paternity.
The victim's lawyer said the case was set in motion after her client received child support from the state.
The case is thought to be the first of its kind in Michigan and maybe the US.
Attorney Rebecca Kiessling filed objections on Friday after Judge Gregory Ross ruled that Mirasolo had parental rights to the boy, who is now eight years old, reports the Detroit News.
Judge Ross also provided Mirasolo with the victim's home address.
The woman, who now lives in Florida, has been told to move back to Michigan.
Judge Ross also ordered Mirasolo's name to be added to the birth certificate without the mother's consent, her attorney added.
What's the case's background?
A 21-year-old woman told police Mirasolo forcibly raped her while holding her captive when she was 12 in September 2008.
The victim's ordeal began when she, her 13-year-old sister and a friend sneaked out of their house to meet an older boy and his friend, Mirasolo, who was 18 at the time.
Mirasolo held them captive for two days before releasing the older sister in a park.
He was arrested a month later when the woman became pregnant, Ms Kiessling added.
The charge is a first-degree felony in Michigan, but Mirasolo instead received a plea deal from the Sanilac County Prosecutor's Office for attempted third-degree criminal sexual conduct.
He was sentenced to one year in county jail, but only served six-and-a-half months before he was released early to care for his sick mother.
In 2010, he sexually assaulted another victim between the ages of 13 and 15 and was jailed for four years, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections.
Mirasolo was released in March 2012 and is a registered sex offender.
His supervision conditions include having a ""responsible adult"" present if he is with a minor.
How could this happen?
According to Ms Kiessling and the victim, the case was prompted after the mother sought child support.
Mirasolo's attorney, Barbara Yockey, told the Detroit Free Press that her client ""never initiated"" the custody case.
She said it was ""routinely done by the prosecutor's office when a party makes application for state assistance"".
""Chris was notified of the paternity matter and an order of filiation was issued last month by the court saying he had joint legal custody and reasonable visitation privileges,"" she said.
Ms Yockey said her client has not suggested he planned to act on his parenting rights and he had no scheduled court appearances.
""I don't know what his plans or intentions might be regarding any future relationship with the child,"" she said.
Ms Kiessling said the case violates the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act, which allows courts to dismiss the parental rights of convicted rapists over a child conceived as a result of rape.
What is the Rape Survivor Child Custody Act?
The law, championed by the Obama administration in 2015, gave states access to more funding for victims of sexual assault if they allowed courts to terminate the parental rights of an individual found to have committed rape against another person that resulted in the conception of a child.
About 5% of rape victims ages 12 to 45 become pregnant as a result of rape, according to the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. A version of the law exists in 43 states and the District of Columbia, but the measures vary from state to state.
In 20 states and the District of Columbia, a rape conviction is required before termination of parental rights is allowed.
Critics argue this leaves victims vulnerable in cases that are not prosecuted.
Seven states have no laws barring rapists from asserting their parental rights over a child."
Kobe Steel’s Falsified Data Is Another Blow to Japan’s Reputation,"Last week, Nissan Motor said unqualified staff members had carried out inspections at its factories, prompting the carmaker to recall 1.2 million vehicles, though it was not clear if the quality of the vehicles had been affected. Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor both admitted last year that they had been exaggerating the fuel economy of their vehicles by cheating on tests.
Perhaps the biggest blow to Japan’s reputation for quality has come from Takata, the airbag maker that was at the center of the largest auto safety recall in history, involving tens of millions of vehicles. Its faulty airbags have been blamed for more than a dozen deaths. Takata declared bankruptcy in June.
Toshiaki Oguchi, director of Governance for Owners Japan, a corporate watchdog, said that Japanese companies were generally diligent about quality, but that when cheating occurred — because of competitive pressure or other factors — it could too easily go unchecked. Japanese companies, he said, tend to discourage thorough examination or criticism, either from employees or from independent outsiders.
“When something goes wrong, companies always hire a committee of outsiders to examine what happened,” Mr. Oguchi said. “But why not be proactive? Why not have people reviewing procedures all the time?”
The extent of the problems at Kobe Steel are still unfolding.
Kobe Steel said on Sunday that employees at four of its factories had altered inspection certificates on aluminum and copper products from September 2016 to August this year. The changes, it said, made it look as if the products met manufacturing specifications required by customers — including for vital qualities like tensile strength, a measure of material’s ability to withstand a load without breaking when being stretched — when they did not.
On Wednesday, the company said it was investigating possible data falsification involving another product, powdered steel, which is used mostly to make gears. The company said the powdered steel it was examining had been sold to one customer it did not name.
Kobe Steel added that it was examining other possible episodes of data falsification going back 10 years. The company did not provide significant details on the discrepancies, making it difficult to immediately determine if they posed a safety threat. No deaths or safety incidents have been attributed to Kobe Steel.

The company’s share price dropped sharply on Tuesday, the first day of trading after a holiday, and as of Wednesday morning in Tokyo had lost about one-third of its value since last week.
“The falsification problem has become an issue that could destroy international faith in Japanese manufacturing,” the Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei said in an article on Tuesday.
Even as Japan has given up its lead in technologies like televisions, cellphones and computers, it still excels in highly valued products used behind the scenes, including precision machinery, specialty chemicals, sensors and cameras.

Quality helps Japan preserve its markets overseas despite intense competition. Although China is the world’s largest steel maker, Japan still exports large amounts of iron and steel there.
One of the products at the center of the scandal, rolled aluminum, is widely used in the transportation industry because it is light. The lighter a car, train or airplane, the less fuel required to propel it.
Global manufacturers are now trying to assess their exposure, as they dig through an extensive supply chain.
A big car company like G.M. buys millions of tons of steel a year from a dozen or two dozen producers, in a variety of grades and forms. Steel can be sourced from different mills and shipped to any number of plants worldwide. G.M., for example, has 12 vehicle assembly plants and six stamping plants in the United States alone, all of which take deliveries of steel from many different producers.
All of Japan’s major carmakers — Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota — are looking into their use of Kobe Steel materials. Toyota called the data falsification a “grave issue” and said it was looking into the problem and considering how best to respond, a statement echoed by other carmakers. Ford and General Motors are trying to determine whether they have used the company’s products.
Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which makes equipment for Shinkansen high-speed trains in Japan, said it was investigating. JR Tokai, a railway company that operates the busiest Shinkansen route in Japan, between Tokyo and Osaka, said that the data discrepancies “do not present a problem in terms of design standards,” but that it was nonetheless considering whether to replace certain train components.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses aluminum from Kobe Steel in a midsize aircraft it is developing, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, as well as aircraft components it supplies to Boeing. Mitsubishi Heavy said it was investigating. Boeing said in a statement, “Nothing in our review to date leads us to conclude that this issue presents a safety concern, and we will continue to work diligently with our suppliers to complete our investigation.”
Kobe Steel’s problem points to “a common organization issue,” said Shin Ushijima, a lawyer who serves as president of the Japan Corporate Governance Network. He drew parallels between Kobe Steel and Takata and Mitsubishi, as well as with financial-reporting improprieties at Toshiba, which admitted to overstating profit in 2015.
“Boards aren’t doing their jobs,” he said. “This isn’t an issue that can be solved by the president resigning. There needs to be wholesale change.”
He added, “The Kobe Steel case is a test of whether we’ve learned anything from Toshiba and these other issues.”
Kobe Steel said it had confirmed data falsification affecting roughly 19,300 tons of flat-rolled and extruded aluminum products, 19,400 units of aluminum casting and forgings, and 2,200 tons of copper products. The amount was about 4 percent of the company’s output of those products from September 2016 to August.
The company said that it had received no reports from customers of problems with the affected products, and that the falsification had been discovered during an internal review. The improperly certified metals had been shipped to about 200 companies, but Kobe Steel declined to reveal their names.
It said “tens” of employees and managers had been directly involved in the falsification, although no penalties against the employees were immediately announced. The company is still investigating."
Hollywood mostly silent on Weinstein allegations,"(CNN) More than a day after The New York Times published a blistering report detailing numerous accusations of sexual harassment against prolific film producer Harvey Weinstein, none of the movie mogul's frequent A-list collaborators have spoken publicly about the news story that has rattled Hollywood.
CNN reached out to representatives for a dozen actors and directors who have worked on Weinstein-produced films. All failed to respond or declined to comment.
On social media, Jessica Chastain, Judd Apatow, Lena Dunham, Brie Larson, and Amber Tamblyn are a few of the artists and filmmakers who posted messages of support to Weinstein's accusers or commented on the Times report.
""As always, I stand with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment. It's not your fault. I believe you,"" Larson wrote.
Chastain, considered an awards season contender for her work in Aaron Sorkin's ""Molly's Game,"" said: ""Women are fighting against the 'Grab Them By The Pussy' normalization & speaking up. It's never easy to be the first to go on record #Respect""
On Thursday, The Times published a story chronicling nearly three decades of alleged sexual misconduct by Weinstein, and claiming that Weinstein had come to legal settlements with at least eight female accusers over the years.
Weinstein has said he will sue over the publication's handling of the story, which featured interviews with accusers including actress Ashley Judd.
Charles Harder, Weinstein's attorney claimed that Weinstein's camp provided information that the Times failed to include, but he did not identify specific inaccuracies in the report.
Tamblyn, who appeared in The Weinstein Company's 2012 film ""Django Unchained,"" offered her thoughts on those who came forward in the article.
""Heed the mantra and never forget: Women. Have. Nothing. To. Gain. And. Everything. To Lose. By. Coming. forward,"" she tweeted.
Apatow, a producer on awards hopeful ""The Big Sick,"" took aim at Weinstein's statement on the accusations, released yesterday.
In Weinstein's statement, he claimed he ""came of age in the 60's and 70's, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.""
""That was the culture then,"" he said. ""I have since learned it's not an excuse, in the office - or out of it.""
Apatow tweeted: ""The 70's were 37 years ago. You are blaming growing up in the 70's? You haven't picked up anything since then?""
Weinstein also expressed remorse and announced he would be taking a leave of absence from The Weinstein Company to seek treatment.
""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,"" Weinstein said.
Late Friday, The Weinstein Company announced his leave would be indefinite and begin immediately.
Hollywood's need for a 'culture change'
How long the silence from Weinstein's closest allies will last remains to be seen.
Kirsten Schaffer, executive director of Women In Film, a nonprofit that promotes gender parity in Hollywood, said she believes the lack of response won't last.
""I'm hopeful it's going to come,"" she said, when asked about the radio silence from Weinstein's deep well of famous heavy-hitters. ""If it doesn't come, we still live in a culture of fear. People are legitimately afraid of speaking out and that it will affect their careers because it has affected people's careers in the past.""
Schaffer said there is a need for a ""culture change in Hollywood"" -- one that would empower people to speak out about their own experiences and support victims.
""I think for the culture to change, it takes leaders -- leaders of studios, networks, production companies, agencies, to change the value system,"" she said. ""They need to put as much weight on doing the right thing as they put on making money. I really believe those two can co-exist.""
In the short term, The Weinstein Company, which Weinstein co-founded with his brother Bob in 2005, may have some more immediate concerns.
Attention paid to the accusations against Weinstein could overshadow the release of ""The Current War,"" a drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison and Michael Shannon as George Westinghouse. The November 24 release was considered one of The Weinstein Company's awards contenders.
The production company also has ""Paddington 2"" out on January 12 and ""The Upside"" with Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart out March 9, and ""Mary Magdalene"" starring Rooney Mara out March 30.
The long-term affects of the accusations against Weinstein are harder to pin point. Will Hollywood actresses will turn their back on The Weinstein Co.? Will actors?
Schaffer would like to hear from both and believes actors need to stand side-by-side on the issue.
""I would love to see more actors leaning in...and speaking out about it. I think that's definitely part of the solution,"" she said. ""Male allies are critical. We can't do this without them. We need more brave men to step up and speak out."""
Kenya bans city-center protests as vote tension mounts,"A woman tries to escape from a bus after riot policemen fired a tear gas canister at the public vehicle during clashes between supporters of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta and supporters of Kenyan opposition National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition, during a protest in Nairobi, Kenya, October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Baz Ratner
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan authorities banned protests in central Nairobi and other hotspots as they tried to keep a lid on mounting political turmoil in the build-up to a repeat presidential vote.
The order issued on Thursday covered business districts in Nairobi, the western city of Kisumu and the port of Mombasa - the scenes of repeated demonstrations since the Supreme Court annulled the last vote in August, citing irregularities.
The main opposition, which has held rallies calling for electoral reforms and the sacking of vote officials, said it would take to the streets again on Friday, and on a daily basis from Monday, despite the ban.
“The protests are covered by the bill of rights in the constitution. We do not hold the protests as a favor by the State,” Dennis Onyango, the spokesman for opposition leader Raila Odinga, said.
Politicians and activists from all sides have traded insults and accusations since the court ruling, raising fears of a repeat of the ethnically charged violence that killed around 1,200 people after a contested 2007 vote.
President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose August election victory was annulled by the court ruling, is due to stand again against Odinga on Oct. 26.
But this week Odinga announced he was withdrawing from the race, because of failure to reform the election board. The board responded that the vote would go ahead anyway with the names of Odinga and the other original candidates on the ballot paper.
“THE POLITICAL BATTLE”

At least 17 demonstrators were hospitalized on Wednesday with bullet wounds and other injuries, said medical workers in Kisumu, an opposition stronghold.
The opposition has accused the police of using excessive force while the government has accused the protesters of destroying private property .
Reuters saw footage of a crowd attacking a policeman with stones and sticks during protests in the western town of Homa Bay, near Kisumu. Marius Tum, the Homa Bay police boss, said 14 people had been arrested and would be charged with assault and participating in unlawful assembly.

Odinga’s spokesman Onyango did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the incident.
The standoff has spooked investors in the region’s richest economy. The all share index on the Nairobi bourse was 0.43 percent lower at the close, amid low volumes, traders said.
In August, only Odinga and Kenyatta polled more than one percent. Three of the other candidates - Abduba Dida, Japheth Kavinga and Ekuru Aukot - told Reuters they intended to stand again.
“The political battle in this country has been between the Odingas and the Kenyattas for the longest time,” said Aukot. “Voters will be looking for a neutral person who can pacify the country.”
A Kenyan rights group said this week that at least 37 people were killed in protests immediately following the Aug. 8 poll.
The opposition did not call any protests on Thursday."

Bucs Finish Up Homestand on Winning Note 5-3,"Bucs Finish Up Homestand on Winning Note 5-3
(Before It's News)
Cutch was still feelin’ it after yesterday’s game; he threw out an Oriole that had the audacity to tag on him in the first and then a bit later singled Fraze to third (after a nice ovation from the fans), where he scored on J-Bell’s knock. Chad Kuhl wasn’t feeling it; a pair of singles and another set of doubles put Baltimore ahead 3-1 in the second. Gregory homered off Gabriel Ynoa to cut the lead to one and in the third, a two-out Cutch walk followed by a Bell bomb put Pittsburgh ahead by a run. Man, Baltimore must have called up a lot of pitchers this month – Mike Wright took the hill in the fourth; they only got four innings out of Kevin Gausman last night.
Felipe brought the smoke tonight (photo Pittsburgh Pirates)
It heated up a little more; the Bucs left a pair aboard in the fifth, then the Birds got their first two men aboard in the sixth, chasing Kuhl and bringing on Jack Leathersich. He got his out, then Clint waved in Edgar Santana (September bullpens!) who got the next two. Dovydas Neverauskas tossed a clean seventh and the Bucs added an insurance marker off Mychal Givens when Starling’s two-out infield knock brought home S-Rod who had doubled. George Kontos worked the eighth quietly as did Richard Bleier for Charm City. Felipe Rivero gave up a double in the ninth to keep it interesting but quickly laid it to rest, which isn’t all that hard when you’re lighting the radar gun at 103.
Chad had a rough outing – five IP, three runs, eight hits – but five K & just one walk helped to keep the damage contained. Cutch and J-Bell pumped up the middle of the order; one or two more run producers should be on the FO’s 2018 to-do list.
J-Bell brought the lumber (photo Pittsburgh Pirates)
Notes:
Josh Bell had three hits and three RBI, Starling had a couple of knocks and Cutch had a rap and was walked twice, reaching base seven times in a row before finally making an out.
Pedro Alvarez started tonight’s game; this is El Toro’s first visit back to PNC Park since he and the Bucs parted ways. He was given a video tribute and got a warm welcome from the fans. Petey even started a 3-6-3 DP in the first inning, something he was seemingly incapable of here.
Teke also drew a rousing roar when he was recognized tonight while doing his last Pirates game, not only by the fans but by the entire Pirates dugout.
He didn’t do the National Anthem, but Pittsburgh’s Wiz Khalifa did toss the final ceremonial first pitch of the 2017 campaign.
24,779 visited the park tonight.
The hot & cold Bucs have now won four in a row as they travel to DC to close the season with a four-game stand with the Nationals.
The Cubs clinched the NL Central tonight with a 5-1 win over the Cards.

Watch Out Establishment: Alabama Upset is a Warning to GOP Leaders,"Watch Out Establishment: Alabama Upset is a Warning to GOP Leaders
(Before It's News)

Republican establishment politicians are shaking in their boots after Alabama voters handed them a stunning electoral loss in a Senate primary race that attracted national attention. Challenger Roy Moore, the darling of the grassroots conservative movement, steamrolled over handpicked incumbent Luther Strange to win the Republican Party nomination. Despite being opposed by Mitch McConnell, an enormous pro-establishment super PAC, and the President of the United States himself, Moore rode to victory on a groundswell of support from popular figures like Steve Bannon and Sarah Palin – to take nothing away from his own hard-earned reputation for smash-and-burn Christian conservative politics.
And experts believe that Moore’s unlikely but decisive victory – almost certainly to be followed by another victory in December against his Democrat opponent – will send shockwaves through Washington, D.C.
From the Washington Post:
The GOP primary victory by conservative firebrand Roy Moore over Sen. Luther Strange could produce a stampede of Republican retirements in the coming months and an energized swarm of challengers. It marked yet another humiliation for the Washington-based Republican establishment, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose allies pumped millions of dollars into the race to prop up Strange and reassure his colleagues that they could survive the Trump era. Moore’s win, however, also demonstrates the real political limitations of Trump, who endorsed “Big Luther” at McConnell’s urging and staged a rally for Strange in Huntsville, Ala., just days before the primary. The outcome is likely to further fray Trump’s ties to Republicans in Congress, many of whom now fear that even his endorsement cannot protect them from voter fury.
Trump himself appeared almost embarrassed by his own endorsement of Strange. In the days before the election, he assured Alabama voters that he would support Moore with a full-throated endorsement going into the general election even if his guy didn’t win. And in the hours after Moore dispatched with Strange, Trump began deleting some of his recent tweets expressing support for the incumbent. We don’t know what kind of bad advice Trump got or who he got it from, but it’s clear that he was right on Friday in Huntsville when he admitted to the crowd: “I might have made a mistake.”
If there was any remaining myth about the imperviousness of incumbent Republicans backed by the establishment, though, Tuesday’s results put an end to it. The people are taking back the GOP – a movement that started with the Tea Party, continued through Trump’s stunning victory last November, and is still growing steam today. The swamp is going to be drained one way or the other. Same old, same old just ain’t gonna cut it anymore.

"Lisa Bloom, Lawyer Advising Harvey Weinstein, Resigns Amid Criticism From Board Members","“You have a commercial relationship with TWC via a TV deal so how can you possibly provide impartial advice to Harvey or address this group with any credibility?” Mr. Maerov asked in the email.
In a separate email, Mr. Maerov, who declined to comment on Saturday, said that “publishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory or negate any harm done to them through alleged actions.”
Bob Weinstein wrote Ms. Bloom a disapproving email on Friday morning, shortly before she appeared on “Good Morning America.” He pointed out that Democratic politicians were giving away money that Mr. Weinstein had donated to them, women’s rights organizations were calling for him to be fired and actors and actresses were openly stating how appalled they were. “It is my opinion, that u are giving your client poor counsel,” he wrote. “Perhaps, Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.”
Bob Weinstein declined to comment on Saturday.
The details about the emails came to light one day after a third of the all-male board of the Weinstein Company resigned. The remaining board members announced on Friday that they had hired an outside law firm to investigate the allegations and that Mr. Weinstein would take an indefinite leave of absence.
“I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein,” Ms. Bloom said on Twitter on Saturday morning. “My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.”
Ms. Bloom said on Saturday that there was a large team handling Mr. Weinstein’s defense and that she personally “did not release photos of accusers” to the press. She also denied that her work with Mr. Weinstein created a conflict of interest.
“A conflict is representing two different sides in the same case,” she said. “This is a difficult time for all involved and I wish everyone the best.”

Lanny Davis, another adviser to Mr. Weinstein, is also no longer representing him, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Davis, a lawyer and crisis counselor who served as special counsel to President Bill Clinton, declined on Saturday to discuss his departure. But he and Mr. Weinstein had disagreed over how to handle the sexual harassment allegations, with Mr. Davis advising a more conciliatory tone and approach than Mr. Weinstein seemed willing to adopt.
The allegations of harassment against Mr. Weinstein reach back decades. Women accused him of requesting massages, appearing naked in front of them and asking if they wanted to watch him shower, among other behaviors. The Times investigation found that Mr. Weinstein had settled with at least eight women over the years.

Mr. Weinstein apologized for his behavior and acknowledged that it had “caused a lot of pain.” But he denied many of the allegations and said he intended to sue The Times for failing to give him enough time to respond to them.
Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokeswoman, said that Mr. Weinstein had had two days to respond before the article was published, and that his full statement had been included. “Mr. Weinstein and his lawyer have confirmed the essential points of the story,” she said. “They have not pointed to any errors or challenged any facts in our story.”
In a statement on Friday, four of the Weinstein Company’s remaining board members said that Mr. Weinstein’s leave of absence would begin immediately. The company will be led in his absence by Bob Weinstein, its co-chairman, and David Glasser, its president and chief operating officer.
“As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged,” the statement said. “Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions.”
Ms. Bloom, who had been advising Mr. Weinstein over the past year on gender and power dynamics, said on “Good Morning America” that his behavior had been inappropriate. She agreed with an interviewer who characterized his reported actions as illegal.
“It’s gross, yeah,” Ms. Bloom said. “I’m working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, ‘I have caused a lot of pain.’”
She had previously described Mr. Weinstein as “an old dinosaur learning new ways.”
Ms. Bloom has in the past represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against the actor Bill Cosby and the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. Her work for Mr. Weinstein drew criticism, including from her mother, Gloria Allred, the famed women’s rights lawyer.

“Had I been asked by Mr. Weinstein to represent him, I would have declined, because I do not represent individuals accused of sex harassment,” Ms. Allred said. “While I would not represent Mr. Weinstein, I would consider representing anyone who accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment, even if it meant that my daughter was the opposing counsel.”
This year, the Weinstein Company said that it planned to work on a series of television and film projects about the life of Trayvon Martin, based on a pair of books about the teenager. One of the books, “Suspicion Nation,” was written by Ms. Bloom, who announced in April that it would be turned into a mini-series.
After the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were revealed, actresses and others in Hollywood spoke out against him and expressed support for his accusers. They were joined Saturday morning by the MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, who said on Twitter that she was considering walking away from a three-book deal with Weinstein Books.
“I can’t go forward with those books unless Harvey resigns,” she said, adding, “Authors, actors, and moviemakers should not work for any Weinstein company until he resigns. Not a close call.”
President Trump, who himself has been accused of making unwelcome advances toward women, also commented on the matter. Asked about the allegations on Saturday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters that he had known Mr. Weinstein “for a long time,” adding, “I’m not at all surprised to see it.”"
The Girl in the No. 8 Jersey,"Stacee’s family soon announced that she died. My wife and I didn’t really know Stacee much — obviously not well enough to notice that she was not among the few dozen people at a rec-level girls’ soccer game. But some of our closest friends were dear friends of hers, and our town is small enough that there was probably no more than two degrees of separation to the family.
My family was among the hundreds of people, friends and strangers, who crowded onto the grounds of an elementary school and held candles aloft during the vigil. My daughter was one of the dozens of kids who solemnly held roses in her honor, and she hugged her classmate and teammate when it ended. She and a couple of friends made a cake and delivered it to the Etchebers’ house the next day.
Orange was Stacee’s favorite color, and on Friday, after people bought as much orange ribbon as they could find at all the local craft stores, an army tied ribbons all around town, from the trees on downtown’s Grant Avenue to the posts in front of Pioneer Park. My wife and her friends tied them around the trees in front of the middle school where Stacee’s daughter goes to school, along with mine.

I missed it all. I was as close to the site of the shooting as you could get, and yet felt fully disconnected from the effect of the tragedy. One night I walked to the memorial that sprang up in the median of South Las Vegas Boulevard, the kind of now-familiar post-shooting memorial that I saw at Columbine almost two decades before, with balloons and flowers and candles. I found a photo of Stacee that had been placed in the middle of it all, and took a picture and sent it home.
In Las Vegas, Stacee was just one in a crowd, part of a list. But she and her family were all anyone talked or thought about back in Novato, and that is where I got my news. I heard that Stacee’s husband, a San Francisco police officer, was running with Stacee through the barrage of gunfire when he stopped to help someone; he told his wife to go on and never saw her alive again. I heard that television news trucks were parked in front of the house. I heard stories of friends pulling over in their cars to cry at the weight and nearness of it all. There were beautiful and crushingly sad Facebook posts in Stacee’s honor, the kind you see after every tragedy, except these were written by people I knew well.
I heard my wife, who grew up in a nearby town, tell me that she had never been more proud to call Novato home.
I checked out of that Mandalay Bay suite on Saturday morning, excused from reporting duties, and flew home in the hopes of making my daughter’s soccer game. I found the red rose from the vigil, starting to fade and wilt, in a vase on the kitchen counter. When we got to the game, we and the other parents were somewhat surprised to see Stacee’s husband and extended family there, too. Warming up with the girls was No. 8, with her long ponytail.
We all wore orange ribbons, attached by safety pins, including the girls on both teams. The Novato team wore orange armbands with the initials “S.E.” Before kickoff, both squads came across the field to the spectator side and lined up in straight lines. Our team’s coach asked the parents to stand for 30 seconds of silence. And then two of the league’s better teams played a rather meaningless soccer game, only this one felt about as meaningful as anything I’ve ever watched.
And it was late in the second half when the ball suddenly swung from one end to the other, and Stacee’s daughter gave chase through three retreating opponents and beat them all to the ball. And in one blink-and-you-missed-it moment, she booted the ball into the corner of the net for what held on as the winning goal.

Two Russian tycoons sell 3 percent of aluminum giant Rusal for $315 million,"The logo of Russian aluminium producer Rusal is seen on a board at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2017 (SPIEF 2017) in St. Petersburg, Russia, June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian tycoons Mikhail Prokhorov and Viktor Vekselberg have sold a 3 percent stake in Russian aluminum giant Rusal via an accelerated bookbuilding (ABB) for $315 million, one of their bookrunners said on Wednesday.
The deal came less than a week after Russia’s En+ Group, which owns a 48 percent stake in Rusal, said it would launch an initial public share offering in London and Moscow.
The ABB offering of about 456 million shares was priced at the lower end of the range of HK$5.40-HK$5.55?? with a 7.5-percent discount to the pre-deal market price, the bookrunner said.??
Rusal shares fell 7 percent in Hong Kong on Wednesday, but are still up more than 65 percent since the start of 2017.
Prokhorov sold 0.7 percent in Hong Kong-listed Rusal and Vekselberg sold 2.3 percent, reducing their stakes in the company to 6 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively. Goldman Sachs and Renaissance Capital were the joint bookrunners.
The deal could increase the liquidity of Rusal’s shares in Moscow and make it easier for Rusal to be included in the prestigious MSCI Russia Index, investment bank BCS has said.
Assuming that the placement was made into an open market, the free float of Rusal has increased to 16.4 percent, but its inclusion in the MSCI index in November is unlikely, VTB Capital said in a note on Wednesday.
The company may get into the index in May, subject to the liquidity of its shares in Moscow and MSCI’s goodwill, it added."
US Army chief: 'No risk-free options' on North Korea,"Story highlights Milley warned: ""A full-blown war on the Korean Peninsula will be horrific by any stretch of the imagination""
""There are no good, easy, you know, risk-free options here,"" he said
Washington (CNN) US Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley made clear Monday what a bind the US is in when it comes to solving the challenge of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, stating there are ""no risk-free options"" but said there is also not an ""indefinite amount of time"" to solve the crisis.
""A full-blown war on the Korean Peninsula will be horrific by any stretch of the imagination. No one has any doubts about that,"" Milley told reporters during a news conference on the sidelines of the Association of the United States Army's annual meeting in Washington.
And while Milley said that a full-scale military conflict on the Korean Peninsula would be ""horrible,"" he also suggested that North Korea gaining possession of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the US would be similarly unacceptable.
""It would be horrible, there's no question about it, but so would an intercontinental ballistic missile striking Los Angeles or New York City. That would be equally horrible,"" he said.
And while the Army chief made it clear that the military is ready to act, he said there are no ""risk-free options.""

Train Stations to use Facial Recognition and Palm Vein Scanners for Payment,"By MassPrivateI
Editor’s Note: The stages of incrementalism seem to be speeding up. Nicholas West has written for Activist Post just this month about China’s high tech KFC called KPRO turning to facial recognition for payment, as well as a UK supermarket becoming the world’s first to use finger vein scans for its customers. The use of biometrics was, of course, first peddled as a necessary security measure, so we have seen it spread in that capacity from planes to trains and even for event security. Now the cashless agenda can more aggressively make its move for the full roll-out of biometric identification and payment into every facet of daily life.
The article below from MassPrivateI offers additional context for what is now leading to biometric payment systems at train stations.
The TSA is winning the war on Americans minds as commuters are being tricked into giving away their rights without a fight.
The above video warns that facial recognition body scanners are coming to a train station near you…
Soon you might have to pass through one of these to get to your train or subway.
Last week, the TSA Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority ‘voluntarily’ asked commuters to walk through facial recognition body scanners before being allowed to board a train.
If you watched the video you might have noticed that the mass media (CBS) did not interview a single person who was concerned about their privacy. Instead, they quoted passengers who think body scanners are a good thing.
Nothing suspicious about that, right?
CBS warned that if the LA Metro installs body scanners next year, commuters won’t be able to opt-out.
According to an article in the LA Times, the LA Metro has begun piloting biometric body scanners that send short-wave radio frequencies through commuters’ bodies to search for bombs and weapons.
A ‘pilot program’ is really a government euphemism for gauging the public’s response to another intrusive police search.
Updated 9/26:
Train stations to use facial recognition and palm vein scanners
UK commuters will be identified by using either a palm vein scanner or facial recognition.
The palm vein scanner uses an infrared sensor to capture the pattern of blood vessels in your hand. At the moment, Cubic envisages that a rider would go to a station to register their palm print and link it to their payment account. Then, when they put their hand on the scanner before a journey, the scanner will recognize their palm and charge their account. “The point being you could use your hand rather than your oyster card as a token to access the system,” Cubic strategy manager David Roat says. […] The facial recognition system would work in a similar way to the palm vein scanner: You register your face as your ticket, then cameras and infrared sensors at the gate detect you when you pass through and charge your payment account. The use of infrared sensors means the system couldn’t be fooled by a 2D image. (Source)
According to an article in The Guardian, the start-up company Evolv Technology is pilot testing high-speed body scanners at the Los Angeles’s Union Station, Union Station in D.C., and the Denver international airport.
Evolv has taken a page right out of the TSA playbook citing safety concerns and fears of terror to justify their usage.
Evolv CEO Michael Ellonbogen said, “I think we need to change our entire take on physical security and knit it into the flow of our daily lives”. “It’s an unfortunate trend, but physical security is morphing and the problem is worsening”, said Lux Capital’s Bilal. (Source)
Corporations are using Americans fears of terror to make huge profits.
Evolv stands to make hundreds of millions of dollars if commuter train stations install their body scanners. A single scanner will cost taxpayers $60,000, while Bill Gates who helped fund Evolv Technology makes a nice profit.
Police use our fears of terror to justify losing of our rights
An LA Times article served as a mouthpiece to justify more government spying.
“While we’ll never become a fully secured environment like you’d have in the airport, we do want to find a way to more effectively screen passengers,” Metro security executive Alex Wiggins said. “We are trying to stay ahead of the threat.”
Mr. Wiggins isn’t done scaring the public just yet…
“Transportation is a very soft and attractive target,” said Wiggins,“Given the recent large-scale attacks at transit facilities in Europe, we need to see if there is technology that can screen large number of peoples and focus in on weapons and explosives.” (Source)
Curiously, the LA Times devoted only one sentence to privacy concerns.
Three months ago, I warned everyone that California Transit Authorities have a history of using corporate surveillance technology to spy on commuters.
A class action lawsuit in California revealed that Transit Police are using a ‘Bart Watch’ app and Stingray surveillance to allegedly spy on commuters texts and emails.
Let’s make one thing perfectly clear: the war on terror is a for-profit business being led by private corporations and DHS. (The TSA is part of DHS.)
To learn more, I recommend checking out Gary Jacobucci’s article that asked if, ‘DHS is a private offshore corporation.‘ Here are two companies that appear to be fronts for DHS: Homeland Security Solutions and Homeland Security Corporation. (Click here & here to find out more.)
Body scanners use government watchlists
Evolv uses ‘Known Wolves’, watchlist software that can identify people of interest or anyone on a government watchlist.
Stay on constant lookout for known wolves and other watchlist individuals using proven facial recognition and human IQ. Integrated video camera provides positive ID for alarm resolution. Send notifications and alerts to mobile team or operations center. (Source)
Getting the public to accept facial recognition body scanners at airports and Disney World is only part of a much greater privacy nightmare.
Evolv’s facial recognition body scanners are being used at public area screenings, sporting events, and employee screenings.
Retail stores and conference centers are also using facial biometric cameras and scanners.
Imagine a future where the police use government watchlists, facial biometric scanners, Stingray cellphone surveillance, Bluetooth, and license plate readers to spy on our every movement.
This is our future unless we fight for our privacy rights.

Mediaset and Vivendi in contact over pay-TV dispute: source,"FILE PHOTO: A woman walks walk past the main entrance of the entertainment-to-telecoms conglomerate Vivendi's headquarters in Paris, France, April 8, 2015. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset and French media group Vivendi (VIV.PA) have opened lines of communication to find a solution to a bitter legal dispute, a source close to the matter said on Monday, as shares in the Italian company rose sharply.
The two companies have been at loggerheads since Vivendi backtracked last year on a deal to buy Mediaset’s (MS.MI) pay-TV unit Premium.
The rift deepened when Vivendi built up a 28.8 percent stake in Mediaset last December in a move which the French group said was not hostile but a sign of long-term interest.
Mediaset is 39.5 percent owned by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. It is suing Vivendi for damages of at least 3 billion euros.
An Italian source close to the matter said on Monday lawyers representing Mediaset and Vivendi were holding talks, but added it would be difficult to reach an agreement.
On Saturday Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore said the two sides were negotiating for a possible solution ahead of a court hearing scheduled for Dec. 19.
The paper said a planned joint-venture between Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and Vivendi’s pay-TV arm Canal + could be extended to Mediaset as part of any potential deal.
Milan-based broker Banca Akros said in a note on Monday a possible broader partnership involving Vivendi and Telecom Italia would be a very positive development.
“... a wider industrial partnership with Vivendi-Telecom Italia would offer more value creation for Mediaset than the deep downsizing of Premium announced last January,” it said.
Mediaset’s share price ended the session up 8.3 percent at 3.144 euros, while Vivendi’s shares were up 0.6 percent at 21.28 euros."

"Anti-Abortion Congressman Asked Woman to Have One, Report Says","Photo
Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, a strong and frequent critic of abortion, asked a woman with whom he was having an affair to undergo an abortion, according to a report published on Tuesday by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Mr. Murphy, 65, who is married with an adult daughter, confirmed last month that he “became involved in an affair with a personal friend,” according to a statement previously provided to The Post-Gazette.
The woman involved in the extramarital affair, Shannon Edwards, told the newspaper last month that her relationship with Mr. Murphy had ended. She said she had gotten to know Mr. Murphy, a Republican, when she volunteered to work on a mental health bill, which was signed into law late last year.
In a text message sent to Mr. Murphy on Jan. 25, Ms. Edwards assailed the congressman for hypocrisy. The exchange was included among several documents obtained by The Post-Gazette.

“And you have zero issue posting your anti-abortion stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,” Ms. Edwards wrote, according to The Post-Gazette. The newspaper said that the text was sent amid what proved to be an “unfounded pregnancy scare.”"
Trump administration to roll back Obama clean power rule,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Scott Pruitt addressed a crowd in Kentucky - where some hope for a coal revival
The Trump administration has confirmed plans to repeal an Obama administration rule to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has voiced doubt of climate change, called the Clean Power Plan an overreach.
President Donald Trump ordered the EPA to rewrite the rule in March.
The Clean Power Plan requires states to meet carbon emission reduction targets based on their energy consumption.
Mr Pruitt said he would sign the proposed rule to begin withdrawing from the plan on Tuesday.
""The war on coal is over,"" he told a crowd in Hazard, Kentucky, on Monday.
He continued: ""That rule really was about picking winners and losers.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change
""Regulatory power should not be used by any regulatory body to pick winners and losers.""
Mr Pruitt has previously argued that the Clean Power Plan would force states to favour renewable energy in the electricity-generation market.
As Oklahoma's attorney general, he took part in a lawsuit by 27 US states against the rule.
A Supreme Court ruling in February 2016 left the regulation in limbo.
The EPA under President Barack Obama said the Clean Power Plan could prevent up to 150,000 asthma attacks in children and 6,600 premature deaths.
But according to US media, a leaked draft of the repeal proposal disputes the health benefits touted by the previous administration.
The draft also reportedly argues the country would save $33bn (£25bn) by dropping the regulation.
The Clean Power Plan required states to devise a way to cut planet-warming emissions by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Eliminating the rule would make it difficult for the US to fulfil its promise to cut emissions as part of the Paris Climate accord, a 2015 international agreement which President Obama signed with nearly 200 other countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat global warming.
Mr Trump in June signalled that he would pull out of the pact, dismantling his predecessor's environmental legacy.
In August the Trump administration issued its first written notification to the UN that it intended to withdraw from the agreement.
But the move was largely viewed as symbolic as no nation seeking to leave the pact can officially announce an intention to withdraw until 4 November 2019.
The process of leaving then takes another year, meaning it would not be complete until just weeks after the US presidential election in 2020.
The planned repeal of the Clean Power Plan has sparked outrage among environmental groups.
The National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) threatened to sue the EPA if the plan is repealed while the Sierra Club has indicated it would fight any new rule that does not comply with the country's air pollution laws.
Mary Anne Hitt, the director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign, said in a statement the Trump administration was ""putting the safety of our communities at risk, and making it crystal clear they have no intention of safeguarding people from the very real, immediate dangers of climate change""."

Supreme Court tosses one of two travel ban challenges,"FILE PHOTO - An international traveler arrives after U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order travel ban at Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. January 30, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out an appeals court ruling that struck down President Donald Trump’s previous temporary travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority nations countries that has now expired.
In a one-page order, the court acted in one of two cases pending before the nine justices over Trump’s travel ban, a case from Maryland brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to stop the ban contained in a March executive order.
For now, the court did not act on a separate challenge brought by the state of Hawaii, which the court had also agreed to hear. That case also features a challenge to a separate 120-day refugee ban, which has not yet expired.
That case could yet be dismissed once the refugee ban expires on Oct. 24, meaning the court remains unlikely to issue a final ruling on whether the ban was lawful.
The justices were unanimous in deciding against ruling in the Maryland case, although one of the liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, noted that she would not have wiped out the appeals court ruling.
The justices had been scheduled to hear arguments in the case on Tuesday, but removed it from their calendar after Trump’s 90-day ban expired on Sept. 24 and was replaced with a reworked ban.
The expired ban had targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. The new open-ended ban, scheduled to take effect on Oct. 18, removed Sudan from the list while blocking people from Chad and North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela from entering the United States.
The Trump administration has urged the court to dismiss both cases while the challengers have asked the justices to rule on the issue.
The Supreme Court in June agreed to take up the two cases and allowed the travel ban, which had been blocked by lower courts, to go into effect with certain changes.
Among the issues raised is whether the travel ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring a particular religion.
The new ban, Trump’s third including one issued in January that was blocked by lower courts, could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors to the United States. Opponents have already challenged it in court.
Trump had promised as a candidate “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.”"

When Jets defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas lined up at fullback early in the teams match up with the Dolphins two weeks ago, nobody knew if it was a gimmick, a wild experiment, or a tryout.
Whatever you want to call it, the Jets obviously liked what they saw as Thomas got more looks at fullback again the following week against the Jacksonville Jaguars and threw a few key blocks to spring Bilal Powell free to break away and pick up some big gainers.
Now, it appears to be a full-time gig.

Thomas emerged at practice in Florham Park today wearing number 44, a switch from his defensive line number of 97.
A former college fullback at Michigan State before switching to the D-line, acting as a lead blocker isn’t entirely new for Thomas. If his early results are any indicator as to how he’ll play moving forward, the Jets may have one heck of a 285 lb battering ram filling the role of lead blocker better than anyone the Jets have had since Tony Richardson.

"Russia's Putin, eyeing election next year, pledges to prosecute vote violations","Russia's President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting on preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Moscow, Russia October 3, 2017. Sputnik/Alexei Nikolsky/Kremlin via REUTERS
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The head of Russia’s central election commission urged President Vladimir Putin on Monday to ensure all investigations into election violations detected in Russia last month were completed, and the Kremlin leader promised to do so.
Russia voted in local elections in many regions on Sept. 10 in what was widely seen as a dress rehearsal for next year’s presidential vote, with Kremlin-backed candidates for regional parliaments and governorships performing strongly.
Putin is the strong favorite to win re-election in March, although he has so far declined to say if he will run.
On Sept. 10, Reuters reporters observed the vote at six polling stations. In all six, they found discrepancies, of varying sizes, between the official vote tally and the number of voters the reporters counted.
“We have practically tied up many ‘loose ends’ of that campaign, but small ‘ends’ still remain,” Russian media quoted Ella Pamfilova, head of the central election commission, as telling Putin at a meeting in the Kremlin.
“I really would like our prosecutor general’s office and the investigative committee to bring the matter to completion in a number of cases,” she said, referring to inquiries into local election violations.
She did not elaborate.
“All orders will be given regarding this issue,” Putin replied.

"'Blade Runner,' 'Westworld' test our empathy","(CNN) The following contains major spoilers about ""Blade Runner 2049.""
Like HBO's ""Westworld,"" ""Blade Runner 2049"" tinkered with the DNA of the original movie in reimagining it for the 21st century. In both, the formula includes asking an audience to empathize with artificial intelligence, at a time when such compassion -- even toward fellow citizens with opposing viewpoints -- is often in short supply.
""Westworld"" toyed with expectations by essentially flipping the script. Set in an elaborate amusement park for adults, the series departed from Michael Crichton's original -- where the robots went wild and began killing guests -- to probe the dawning sentience of those creations. Suddenly, the people mistreating them were the bad guys, even if the androids could be rebooted after each sordid encounter.
""Blade Runner"" adopts a similar approach. Its central character, K, played by Ryan Gosling, is a replicant, one charged with hunting down his misbehaving brethren.
Ridley Scott's first film also showed sympathy for these constructs, and there's still debate about the true nature of Harrison Ford's character. In the new plot, K hopes that he might be special in a way that evokes ""Pinocchio,"" as did another movie about a not-quite-real boy, Steven Spielberg's ""A.I.""

The eyes expose our lies. Now AI is noticing.,"The pupils of our eyes are terrible liars.
Scientists have long known this. Our pupils widen ever so slightly when we're being deceptive. The change is so minor -- fractions of a millimeter -- that the average person would never notice.
But now a Utah-based company called Converus has a test that uses a camera to track eyes and sense deception. The technology, called EyeDetect, is gaining popularity as a more affordable, less biased version of a polygraph exam, which has long been the gold standard for detecting lies.
""The eyes are the window of the soul,"" said Juan Becerra, an investigator at Panther Security and Investigations. He used to work with polygraphs at the FBI and now uses EyeDetect. ""This is something that's revolutionary and that's going to change the entire deception detection field.""
EyeDetect, which launched in 2014, is used today in 34 countries as part of job interviews and corporate investigations. Latin American banks, for example, use the technology to determine if their tellers can be trusted. Research has shown the accuracy rates of EyeDetect and polygraph are similar, both nearing 90%.
A person taking an EyeDetect exam sits at a desk and answers true-or-false questions on a tablet. An infrared camera tracks eye movement, blinking and pupil dilation. After 30 minutes, an algorithm scores their deceptiveness on a scale from zero to 100.
An EyeDetect machine costs $4,000, plus from $50 to $150 for each test scored. A polygraph can cost several hundred dollars or more, depending on what the examiner charges. The federal government has paid $2,200 for some exams.
Some local U.S. law enforcement departments and private investigators have started using EyeDetect.
The company initially focused on growth outside of the U.S. due to a law limiting whom private sector employers can test for deception. There is an exception for government jobs. Now Converus is pushing for broader use in the country as polygraphs hamper government hiring.
Converus and the Utah scientists say the U.S. federal government has been slow to embrace the technology. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill this summer lifting the polygraph requirement for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol applicants to address staffing shortages. Advocates for the bill have said flaws in polygraphs have made it more difficult to fill open positions.
Related: Farmers turns to artificial intelligence to grow better tomatoes
The National Center for Credibility Assessment, the federal agency that oversees polygraph exams in federal agencies, hasn't given EyeDetect a vote of confidence that would clear the way for use in the federal government.
A spokesman for the center told CNN Tech that it will research and evaluate optical credibility exams such as EyeDetect, starting next year.
Converus CEO Todd Mickelsen told CNN that 80% of its revenue is coming from customers such as banks and businesses who never used polygraphs before. These companies want to make sure they can trust their employees and prevent corruption. They ask employees if they've done anything that disqualifies them from doing their work.
EyeDetect relies on an algorithm that weighs a variety of factors. The key indicators are if a person's eyes dilates while reading a question, and how fast they read questions.
Our pupils dilate when we're deceptive because lying takes more mental energy. The eyes allow in more light and information to help our brains with their added workload. This evolved as a survival instinct, according to David Raskin, a retired University of Utah professor, who worked on the team that developed the science behind EyeDetect.
The Utah researchers found that a deceptive person will generally take longer to answer questions on a test, as they're being careful. But on the specific questions they're lying on, they will respond faster.
Raskin and the other Utah professors -- a group of leading polygraph researchers who gravitated toward optical tests for deception -- said there are several advantages to sensing lies through the human eyes. Polygraph exam results can be biased because humans administer and score the tests. EyeDetect removes the human element.
For example, an administrator may be fond of an applicant and go easy on them during questioning or ask tougher questions that make the person feel uncomfortable, which can skew the results.
Polygraph administrators must train for three to four months. An EyeDetect exam is overseen by a proctor who undergoes training for half a day.
Ken Roberts, a deputy sheriff in the Dona Ana County Sheriff Department in Las Cruces, New Mexico, has switched from administering polygraphs to EyeDetect exams for pre-employment screenings.
Roberts still sees some uses for polygraphs, such as interviewing a suspect in a homicide case, when tailored follow-up questions are necessary.
A version of EyeDetect is under development to give the test orally, so subjects could listen to questions.
""A lot of the polygraph industry feels very threatened and protective [of their existing method of work]. They think it's going to replace them,"" Raskin said. ""And who knows, maybe in the future it will. But right now, it's not that threat."""

By Duncan Idaho
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced Thursday that his company’s Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) is capable of taking people from any city on the planet to any other city on Earth in less than an hour.
In this PR video, SpaceX shows travelers going from New York to Shanghai in just 39 minutes (not counting the ferry ride.)
SpaceX’s Falcon 9 costs an estimated $62 million per launch. The BFR is heavier (10,500 tons), has a larger diameter (39 ft.) and therefore would cost much more per launch. The BFR in the video would be in ‘reusability mode’ which has a predicted payload capacity of about 300 tons (600,000 pounds) which would allow about 2,600 passengers and their luggage on board at an average one-way ticket price of $23,800 if the Falcon 9 launch costs are used. SpaceX did not immediately return our request for estimated BFR launch costs.
While the video promotes an interesting intercontinental travel option, that is not the vehicle’s primary mission. The BFR, officially the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), was designed to take payloads up to 550 tons to Mars. 50 tons is considered a super-heavy payload by today’s standards as the current heavy-lift champ, the Delta IV Heavy, can only carry about 30 tons into low Earth orbit.
During the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) conference Thursday, Musk narrated a presentation showing the BFR, with its 31 raptor engines, in its intended mission role. Musk discusses the BFR’s capabilities in facilitating the building of a moon base and trips to Mars including the building of a permanent base there. The presentation is set for an engineering audience and does not have the “cool factor” of the previous spaceliner video.

"House Democrats Can’t Impeach Trump, but They’re Willing to Try","Mr. Green’s articles of impeachment have company. Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, plans to introduce his own impeachment articles in the coming weeks. Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, did so in July. And other Democrats in the House, where impeachment proceedings must begin, say they will not be far behind.
“Impeachment is what people understand,” Mr. Cohen said in a recent interview.
The resolutions have no real chance of advancing in the House — a fact that has not been lost on Democrats. Impeachment resolutions are typically referred to the House Judiciary Committee, which serves as the first place for debate and investigation into whether the articles warrant a full hearing by the House. With the Republicans in firm control of the chamber — and the Judiciary Committee gavel — the chance that they receive any real hearing there is next to none.
Thus far, Democratic leaders in the House have urged their colleagues to wait for investigators to do their work. For one, pushing impeachment too early could weaken Democrats’ hand if investigators turn up persuasive evidence of “high crimes and misdemeanors” that could compel bipartisan action. Too great a focus on impeachment could also distract from Democrats’ attempts to put forward a strong economic message.
“The Democratic Party had best be identified with something more than impeachment,” said Dennis J. Kucinich, a former Democratic representative.
In 2008, Mr. Kucinich offered 35 articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush, focused primarily on his handling of the Iraq War. Mr. Kucinich cautioned that resolutions this time around might not yet be supported.
“There is tremendous animosity toward the president, and I understand it,” Mr. Kucinich said. “But I don’t know if there is a sufficient case to warrant a process as vigorous as impeachment.”
Others offered a different warning: In exciting their own base, which they need to regain control of the House next year, Democrats run the risk of igniting Mr. Trump’s.

Something similar happened to President Bill Clinton when he was embroiled in an impeachment fight in the late 1990s. His poll numbers went up and Republicans lost seats in the House.
Recent public polling has found that about 40 percent of Americans support impeachment, but Bill Burton, a former aide in the Obama White House and Democratic campaign operative, said much of that support was pocketed in blue districts.
“There is a growing appetite for impeachment in the most Democratic parts of the country,” he said. “But what is good for downtown L.A. is not what’s good for Bakersfield.”

Those introducing the articles say they felt obliged to act. Their efforts got a lift on Wednesday when Tom Steyer, a prominent Democratic donor from California, wrote a letter demanding lawmakers and Democratic candidates support the president’s removal.
“I’ve got a very safe district that is very supportive of impeachment, I believe,” said Mr. Cohen, whose Memphis district is majority black. “And if I can’t come out for impeachment, then how can I expect these Republicans come out for impeachment?”
Mr. Cohen had initially tried what he calls “impeachment light” — a resolution of no confidence in Mr. Trump. But after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump’s ensuing comments, he said he could no longer wait.
Mr. Sherman, who represents part of San Fernando Valley, in California, first drafted his impeachment article in June, after Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director. He is realistic about his measure’s chances, at least until Mr. Mueller produces evidence or Mr. Trump angers his own party, but said there was too high a risk of damage in the meantime.
“At this stage, my articles are not causing the removal of the president of the United States,” Mr. Sherman said. They are, he said, “speaking for and galvanizing those people who are appalled at the recklessness and the incompetency.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Mr. Green, for his part, framed his decision to proceed with the articles in more personal terms. After Mr. Trump used an expletive last month to describe football players who kneel or sit during the national anthem to raise awareness of police brutality and racial injustice, “I concluded that this was the last straw,” Mr. Green said. The president has a “demonstrable history of inciting white supremacy, sexism, bigotry, hate, xenophobia, race baiting and racism.”
Mr. Green stopped short of introducing his articles on Wednesday, denying Republicans the ability, at least for now, to vote to set them aside. But he read the charges, laced with Mr. Trump’s own words, from the House floor.
“I ask no one to support what I am doing,” Mr. Green said during the interview. “I believe that there are times when you have to stand alone.”"
"U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis Weighs Using ""Kinetic Weapon"" On North Korea","By Aaron Kesel
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis hinted at using a kinetic weapon on Tuesday while discussing tensions with North Korea when he made a Freudian slip.
Mattis was asked whether there was “any military option the US can take with North Korea that would not put Seoul at grave risk,” Mattis responded, “Yes, there are, but I will not go into details.”
Later during the press conference, another reporter questioned Mattis and caught him off-guard:
“Just to clarify, you said that there were possible military options that would not create a grave risk to Seoul,” a reporter asked. “Are we talking kinetic options as well?”
“Yes, I don’t want to go into that,” Mattis responded.
Previously, Mattis stated that a war with North Korea would “involve the massive shelling of an ally’s capital, (South Korea) which is one of the most densely packed cities on earth.”
U.S. President Donald Trump in a speech to the United Nations on Tuesday threatened to “totally destroy North Korea” if Pyongyang didn’t quit its nuclear testing and threats.
This also comes after the U.S. and South Korea wrapped up its annual military drill harassing of North Korea, reminding the dictatorship of its military presence at its southern border.
In 2015, the U.S. Air Force confirmed that military contractor Boeing has an electromagnetic pulse weapon, which is capable of targeting and destroying electrical systems without the collateral damage of killing people. It’s essentially an EMP that takes out the power grid of a given area.
The project is known as the “CHAMP,” or Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project, and it already has been operational since 2015, according to Air Force Research Laboratory commander Major General Tom Masiello.
In January, Trump’s Air Force chief of staff revealed to USA TODAY that the U.S. President could use “space weapons against ISIS.”
“If we want to be more agile than the reality is we are going to have to push decision authority down to some lower levels in certain areas the big question that we’ve got to wrestle with … is the authorities to operate in cyber and space,” General David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, told USA TODAY.
However, the U.S. also has other kinetic weapons in its arsenal that would allow Trump to “totally destroy North Korea” — one of weapons system is the “Rods from God.”
What is the Rods from God? The “Rods from God” is a part of the directed energy weapon family; it’s a kinetic energy weapon.
The rods are directed munitions, the higher you are (the greater your distance from the planet), the greater the kinetic energy you have.
In 2004, published in Popular Science, Eric Adams writes:
A pair of satellites orbiting several hundred miles above the Earth would serve as a weapons system. One functions as the targeting and communications platform while the other carries numerous tungsten rods–up to 20 feet in length and a foot in diameter–that it can drop on targets with less than 15 minutes’ notice. When instructed from the ground, the targeting satellite commands its partner to drop one of its darts. The guided rods enter the atmosphere, protected by a thermal coating, traveling at 36,000 feet per second–comparable to the speed of a meteor. The result: complete devastation of the target, even if it’s buried deep underground. The two-platform configuration permits the weapon to be “reloaded” by just launching a new set of rods, rather than replacing the entire system.
The concept of developing kinetic energy weapons has been around since the 1950s when the RAND Corporation proposed placing rods on tips of ICBMs, although the Pentagon won’t say how far along the research is, or even confirm that any efforts exist, citing those details as classified. The “U.S. Air Force Transformation Flight Plan,” published by the Air Force in November 2003, references “hypervelocity rod bundles” in its outline of future space-based weapons; and, in 2002, another report from RAND, “Space Weapons, Earth Wars,” talks about the effectiveness of such a weapon.
A space weapons agreement was proposed by Rep Dennis Kucinich called the “Space Preservation Treaty” in 2005 which states that countries won’t seek to weaponize space. However, that bill never made it past the introduction stage. Another House of Representatives bill known as the H.R.2977 “Space Preservation Act” was proposed in 2001 to ban the use of “exotic weapons” listing the following:
(B) Such terms include exotic weapons systems such as — (i) electronic, psychotronic, or information weapons; (ii) chemtrails; (iii) high altitude ultra low frequency weapons systems; (iv) plasma, electromagnetic, sonic, or ultrasonic weapons; (v) laser weapons systems; (vi) strategic, theater, tactical, or extraterrestrial weapons; and (vii) chemical, biological, environmental, climate, or tectonic weapons.
Obama violated this agreement under the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act before leaving office, and no one noticed that the legislation he signed is essentially the Star Wars Defense Initiative II that his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, signed calling for a space-based missile system.

America's Willful Negligence Concerning the 9,"By Joe Giambrone
Since December 2002 , at the latest, it became glaringly obvious that certain individuals in the US government had lied about how the 9/11 attacks had come to be. When the Bush administration censored the official congressional investigation, the “Joint Inquiry” into the attacks, notably the 28-page section on foreign state funding to the named hijackers, its legitimacy crumbled.
With that first 9/11 investigation redacted and numerous questions outstanding , the attack victims’ families pressed for a second investigation, later to be known as the “9/11 Commission.” Key findings of this Commission were false—or falsified—as those now released “28 pages” show.
The public evidence against the Saudis is partial and wasn’t followed-up on, indicating internal pressures both before and after the attacks.
One reason for the limited understanding is that it was only after September 11 that the U.S. Government began to aggressively investigate this issue. Prior to September 11th, the FBI apparently did not focus investigative resources on [REDACTED] Saudi nationals in the United States due to Saudi Arabia’s status as an American ‘ally.’ – Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11th, 2001, p.415
Senator Bob Graham, its primary author, has complained vociferously in the years since. The BBC revealed a White House document telling US law enforcement to avoid investigating the Saudis , soon after the Bush administration seized power in January, 2001.
After the elections, the agencies were told to ‘back off’ investigating the Bin Ladens and Saudi royals, and that angered agents. – Greg Palast, BBC Newsnight, November 6, 2001
The evidence of government malfeasance around the 9/11 attacks is not theoretical. The Joint Inquiry implicates Saudi agents who aided several of the named hijackers inside the US. They are Omar al Bayoumi, Osama Bassnan, Shaykh al-Thumairy, Saleh al-Hussayen, and Abdullah bin Laden, the brother of Osama! Prince Bandar bin Sultan, “Bandar Bush,” is also named throughout the report and supplied money to those named individuals. Further redactions plague the current version of the Joint Inquiry report, which could potentially implicate others.
They all walked free, while 2,996 civilians perished in the attacks and another 6,000 were wounded. Over 4,000 first responders have contracted cancer since, due to the toxic environment of the aftermath.
The 28 pages are a starting point, not the end. In 2005 (three years later), the CIA Inspector General, under pressure, released another damning report :
[Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Midhar] were among the hijackers of 9/11, were known by the [CIA] in early January 2000 to have traveled to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to participate in a meeting of suspected terrorists… In January 2000, CTC officers received information that one of these suspected terrorists had a US visa; in March 2000, these officers had information that the other had flown from Bangkok to Los Angeles. In the period January through March 2000, some 50 to 60 individuals read one or more of six Agency cables containing travel information related to these terrorists. (emphasis added) – CIA Office of Inspector General Report, 2005, page xiii/xiv
The controversy concerns what the CIA prefers to call “information sharing” (with FBI), but the Counterterrorism Advisor to the White House, Richard Clarke , has described this as CIA deliberately hiding vital information from his office and from the FBI.
Unless someone intervened to stop the normal automatic distribution, I would automatically get it… There was not a lack of information sharing. They told us everything – except this. (emphasis added) – Richard Clarke, Terror “Czar,” 1992-2003
Clarke was the highest counterterrorism official in America on 9/11. When he accused George Tenet of hiding the terrorists from him and his staff the corporate media went silent, rather than investigating these leads. The CIA denied everything and still clings to its mistakes-were-made story. The CIA’s official “incompetence” story has all the key incompetents promoted rather than fired.
Several FBI agents desperate to prevent 9/11 also had direct dealings with CIA operatives . An FBI liaison to the CIA’s Counter-Terrorism Center (CTC), Doug Miller, drafted a memo to alert the FBI about Hazmi and Midhar coming to America, but a CIA superior blocked that cable from ever being sent.
You follow terrorists halfway around the God damned globe. You find out they have visas on their passport, and you don’t tell the FBI? – FBI Agent Mark Rossini
Beyond the CIA’s obstruction of justice and arguably aiding and abetting terrorists—which would be Treason—the NSA also prevented its surveillance of Al Qaeda phone calls from ever reaching the US FBI agents on the case.
Between 2000 and 2001, as many as twenty calls were made between Hazmi and Midhar and a known Al Qaeda number in Yemen. The NSA never distributed this information to the FBI. – Author Lawrence Wright, The New Yorker
Enough deliberate obstruction allowed the 9/11 attacks to succeed that it is shocking how Americans remain apathetic, complacent, and willfully ignorant of the known facts, never mind the unknown story, which remains covered-up. A Florida court is currently hiding 80,000 pages of FBI surveillance of a mansion owned by a Saudi family connected to the hijackers.
To be clear, these are 80k pages that were never seen by the House of Representatives or Senate to formulate their Joint Inquiry into 9/11. They were never seen by the 9/11 Commission, a supposedly independent body that was actually stuffed with conflicts of interest and insiders.
Multiple hijackers visited this Sarasota mansion, and yet for some reason the FBI has lied about their investigation of it. The record remains classified to this day.
So many clear red flags poke out of the official 9/11 story, and yet the American people largely prefer comfortable myths to hard truths. The propaganda has gotten so thick that you can now read op-eds on CNN with absurd headlines like, “This congressional act [JASTA] threatens US national security.” The author happened to be a Saudi, of course, but more importantly, Nawaf Obaid “previously was special adviser to Saudi Prince Turki Al Faisal.”
Who is Turki al-Faisal?
Only the head of Saudi intelligence, the key man in the arrangement between that Kingdom and Osama bin Laden! CNN should be investigating the many links between Turki al-Faisal and Al-Qaeda, not giving Faisal’s lackey free rein to mislead the American public.
The 2002 Congressional 9/11 investigation was declassified in 2016, after it had been officially covered-up for fourteen years. During that time the US population swallowed the Big Lie. Then it went back to sleep.
The public simply accepted myths and ignored facts, particularly the fact of deliberate cover-up of Saudi official complicity in the attacks. Such a cover-up is Treason under the US Constitution, which has since become a dead letter.
We entered the Age of Treason on the morning of September 11th, 2001, and that crime has continued in broad daylight under three presidents. Hiding the fact of Saudi Arabian state complicity into an attack on America is “aid and comfort” to the enemy. Specific US officials should be arrested and tried, still. The Saudi regime should be rightly considered the enemy of the people of the United States today, as well as others.
Given these realities, one would still be hard-pressed to locate a single American citizen who actually read the 28 pages that prove Saudi complicity in the greatest attack on America since Pearl Harbor—if not ever. When historians recount the fall of America, they will need to acknowledge the deliberate willful ignorance of the population in allowing it to happen.
The America we find ourselves in today is divided and conquered. It is in the interest of the people who wield power: money, media, industry, to provoke the common people into shouting about partisan politics and ignoring the workings of the deep state. Issues like 9/11 Treason are brushed aside in favor of ten-thousand more trivial things, such as whatever Donald Trump last Tweeted.
The people have become negligent, uninformed and overtly hostile to facts that challenge the dominant myths they have swallowed. That is the crux of the game, an information war of attrition. Propaganda resonates subtly across layers of society, like skins of an onion. Regular people are compelled by social pressures to either accept the dominant myth of 9/11 and other government controversies labeled “conspiracy theories,” or to shut up to avoid hostility and ridicule.
The truth of matters like war and peace, terror attacks and covert operations no longer interest the general public enough to invest time into understanding them. Ignorance won. The public has been conditioned to look to their cell phones and to their corporate talking heads, who provide them all the understanding required of cogs in a machine. That machine is empire, a belligerent state of perpetual warfare divorced from legal or moral restraint.
When the facts of international provocations no longer interest the people who can restrain the empire, then the elites in charge have gained a free hand to attack the next targets on their hit list . Since 9/11, we have seen US aggression and destabilization of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, Venezuela, Somalia, and ongoing threats against North Korea, China and most dangerously: Russia.
Those are only the most obvious examples, while in the shadows the US military sent its Special Forces into 138 countries . It created AFRICOM to apply force to uncooperative African nations.
By what right?
The September 11th attacks provide a blanket, perpetual casus belli for Washington to target smaller nations around the globe on the pretext that those have some amorphous connection to “terror.” That was the motive for the 9/11 attacks. It was premeditated and admitted to in the Project for the New American Century document “Rebuilding America’s Defenses.” Some key people wanted it, and they committed Treason to get it, and to keep it covered up.
One cannot “rebuild” America’s defenses unless those defenses have somehow failed. That failure was engineered to be “a catastrophic and catalyzing event, like a New Pearl Harbor.” Far from a “failure,” however, the 9/11 attacks proved to be a rousing success for those invested in the Military-Industrial- Complex. US military spending more than doubled in the subsequent years, from $301.7B in 2000, when their manifesto was written, to more than $711B at its peak in 2011. The military budget dwarfs all other areas of US government spending, and it is where America’s wealth is redirected.

China Open: Nadal beats Kyrgios to take sixth title of the season,"Nadal, a 16-time Grand Slam winner, won the French Open and US Open this year
World number one Rafael Nadal beat Nick Kyrgios 6-2 6-1 in the China Open final to win his sixth title of the season.
Australian Kyrgios began well but lost his way after he became frustrated by a line call in the first set in Beijing.
The temperamental world number 19 continued to let the incident bother him and later received a one-point penalty for continuing to complain.
French and US Open winner Nadal won nine games in a row on his way to reclaiming the trophy he won in 2005.
The two players looked set for a tight contest as Kyrgios battled to fend off five break points in his opening service game.
But having been angered by a line call, the Australian proceeded to complain to the umpire at two changes of end, which eventually cost him a penalty point at the start of the eighth game.
Spaniard Nadal clinched his second break to take the first set, and despite a spirited response from Kyrgios, there was no stopping the 31-year-old.

Gunman’s Girlfriend Said She Didn’t Know He Planned Harm,"• The authorities found evidence that the gunman, Stephen Paddock, planned to escape after the shooting and survive, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said at a news conference on Wednesday evening.
• The bureau is trying to reconstruct Mr. Paddock’s actions, including finding and interviewing “everyone and anyone who crossed his path in recent weeks,” Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I., said at a cybersecurity conference in Boston.
• The killer “is an individual who was not on our radar or anyone’s radar prior to the event,” Mr. McCabe said in an interview with CNBC outside the conference. “So we really have a challenging bit of detective work to do here, to kind of put the pieces back together after the fact.”
• The police on Tuesday revised the number of victims killed on Sunday to 58. All but three of the people have been identified. These are some of their stories.
• President Trump visited Las Vegas on Wednesday and offered words of support for the victims. “The message that I have is that we have a great country and we are there for you,” he said.
No links to terrorism have been found, the F.B.I. says.
Aaron Rouse, the F.B.I. special agent in charge in Las Vegas, said there was “no evidence to indicate terrorism, but this is an ongoing investigation.” Mr. Rouse said at a news conference on Wednesday evening that agents were pursuing several theories about what may have motivated Mr. Paddock.
Sheriff Lombardo seemed skeptical that Mr. Paddock moved the guns into his hotel suite by himself. More than 20 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition were recovered in the suite. They had been brought into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in at least 10 suitcases, the authorities said.
“It was troublesome that he was able to move this much gear into the hotel unassisted,” the sheriff said.
A leaked photograph of the gunman’s hotel suite appears to show a piece of paper on a table. Asked about the note, the sheriff said, “It was not a suicide note.”
Law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that ammonium nitrate had been recovered from Mr. Paddock’s car at the Mandalay Bay. On Wednesday, Sheriff Lombardo said the car also contained other explosives: 50 pounds of tannerite, a nonflammable exploding target used for practice, and 1,600 rounds of ammunition.
The gunman’s girlfriend said she didn’t know he was ‘planning violence.’
“I knew Stephen Paddock as a kind, caring, quiet man. I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together with him,” Ms. Danley said in her statement. “It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.”
Ms. Danley said she was grateful to Mr. Paddock for the trip to the Philippines, her native country, to visit family, but when he wired her money, “which he said was for me to buy a house for me and my family,” she feared that it was his “way of breaking up with me.”
Ms. Danley boarded a flight from Manila to Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to Antonette Mangrobang, a spokeswoman for the Philippine Immigration Bureau.
The authorities, who met Ms. Danley at the Los Angeles airport, have called her a “person of interest” in the shooting investigation, which does not necessarily mean that she is suspected of committing a crime. She was out of the country when the shooting occurred.

More than three hours after her flight came in from Manila, an airport police officer confirmed that she had been taken out of the terminal through a side exit.
In an interview with ABC News, Reynaldo Bustos, Ms. Danley’s brother, said he had spoken with her after the shooting. He said she told him not to panic and that she had a “clean conscience.”
Ms. Danley met Mr. Paddock when she was working at a Nevada casino and he was a high-limit player, casino employees said. She worked at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno from 2010 to 2013, according to her LinkedIn account.
John Weinreich, an executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa at the time, said he believed that Ms. Danley frequently attended to Mr. Paddock, serving him food and pointing out which machines might be ripe for a payout, eventually becoming his regular host. Read more about Ms. Danley here.
The president met with victims of the attack.
Mr. Trump spent four hours in Las Vegas on Wednesday, including paying tribute to the professionalism of the doctors who treated the Las Vegas shooting victims. He said that meeting with the patients at one hospital made him “proud to be an American.”
The president said he met with some “absolutely terribly wounded” patients and hailed their bravery during the horrific attack Sunday night. He said many of those he met with were wounded as they sought to help others amid the hail of bullets from the shooter in a nearby hotel.
In brief remarks to reporters before meeting with law enforcement officials in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump said, “I think the only message I can say is that we are with you 100 percent.” Read more about his visit from our reporters.
A total of 489 people were injured in the attack, and 317 have been released from hospitals, Sheriff Lombardo said Wednesday evening.
Body camera footage captured the officers’ response.
Video
Las Vegas police officers took cover and directed concertgoers to safety as gunshots rang out on Sunday, newly released body camera footage shows.
“Hey, you guys, get down,” one officer shouted at bystanders between volleys of gunfire. “Go that way. Get out of here. There are gunshots coming from over there. Go that way.”
But some people did not believe they were under attack and rebuffed orders to evacuate. “That’s fireworks,” one bystander shouted at officers. Another yelled expletives when told to take cover.
As sirens blared and gunfire crackled, the video showed, officers strained to find the source of the shots.
“Hey, they’re shooting right at us, guys,” one officer said as he and his colleagues crouched behind a wall with their weapons drawn. “Everybody stay down, stay down.”
“North of the Mandalay Bay, it’s coming out of a window,” another officer says.
The three-minute video released by the police on Tuesday was a compilation of footage from the cameras of several officers at the scene.
“There’s multiple people shot up there,” someone says in one clip.
“We see muzzle blasts from the Mandalay Bay,” someone, apparently an officer, said in another clip.
The police have also confirmed the authenticity of leaked photographs of the deceased gunman with a revolver by his side and of his hotel suite, showing ammunition and rifles.
The gunman had stockpiled weapons.
Mr. Paddock, 64, had been buying weapons since 1982, including 33 in the past year, Jill A. Snyder, the special agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told CBS on Wednesday.
Asked if such purchases would set off any alarms, she clarified that the bureau would not have been alerted. The Gun Control Act of 1968 requires sellers to report the sale or disposition of two or more handguns to the same buyer, only if those purchases occur at the same time or within five business days of each other. There is no federal law requiring sellers to alert the bureau to the sale of multiple rifles.
Twelve of the rifles Mr. Paddock had in his luxury suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino were outfitted with a “bump stock,” a device that enables a gun to fire like a machine gun, with hundreds of rounds per minute, which may explain how he was able to rain such devastation on the crowd below, law enforcement officials said.
Such devices are generally legal, and the possibility that he may have used them set off a fresh round of calls by Democratic lawmakers in Washington to pass more gun regulations after the tragedy.
Photo
Semiautomatic rifles, like those the gunman had, are made to fire a single round with each pull of the trigger. But recordings and witness accounts of the shooting made it clear that Mr. Paddock was firing much faster, at a rate comparable to that of a fully automatic weapon, which quickly fires round after round with a single pull of the finger. Undersheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas police said that Mr. Paddock fired on the concertgoers for nine to 11 minutes, in about a dozen bursts.
The police have found a total of 47 firearms in his two houses and the hotel suite. Ms. Snyder said on Tuesday that almost all had been traced, and that they had been bought in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas.
Mr. McCabe of the F.B.I. dismissed “dubious claims of responsibility” — a reference to statements from the Islamic State group claiming that the killer was one of its followers — and said that investigators are seeking “actual indicators of motive and intent.”
A deeper portrait of the gunman’s life is emerging.
Mr. Paddock could be imperious and demanding, expecting other people to wait on him, according to people who knew him. But his youngest brother said he was different with Ms. Danley.
“She was probably one of the only people I’ve ever seen that he’d go out of his way to do a little thing for,” said Eric Paddock, who lives in Florida. “He went out of his way to be nice to her. This is not something Steve does — go out of his way.”
The gunman was a professional gambler who routinely won and lost thousands of dollars at casinos in Reno and Las Vegas, which often provided him free rooms. “He was a math guy,” Eric Paddock said. “He could tell you off the top of his head what the odds were, down to a tenth of a percent on whatever machine he was playing.”

Stephen Paddock was the eldest of four boys who grew up angry after their father vanished from their lives, but he was the least angry of the group, said another brother, Patrick Paddock. He said that for years, their mother, who struggled to support them on her own, hid from them the fact that their father, a bank robber, had gone to prison, so they had no idea where he was.
“My brother was the most boring one in the family,” he said of Stephen. “He was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it’s like, who?”
He said he had not spoken with his oldest brother in 20 years, but would not say why.
Stephen Paddock graduated from California State University, Northridge, a large public institution in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, in 1977. Carmen Ramos Chandler, the university’s director of media relations, said that he had completed a degree in business administration.
His work history was not completely clear. Mr. Paddock worked for the federal government for roughly 10 years, from 1975 to 1985, a spokeswoman for the Office of Personnel Management confirmed.
Investigators unearthed multiple job applications, with Mr. Paddock’s fingerprints on file, as part of records reflecting his employment as a letter carrier for the Postal Service in the mid 1970s; as an Internal Revenue Service agent from 1978 to 1984; and as an auditor focused on defense contracts, a job he held until 1985. He also worked in the 1980s for one of the companies that later combined to form Lockheed Martin, the aerospace contractor."
Sarah Silverman Wants to Pop Your Bubble,"Since Ms. Silverman became a star at the start of the new century, the stature of the comedian has shifted away from its roots as spitball-tossing outsider. For better and worse, some stand-ups are now treated like political oracles on social media. And during times of tragedy, late night talk show hosts regularly deliver solemn monologues. The day before I interviewed Ms. Silverman, Jimmy Kimmel unleashed a scathing broadside against the Graham-Cassidy health care bill that dominated the conversation about the legislation the next morning.
While Ms. Silverman is avoiding that kind of argumentative tactic in her own show, she saw his success as supporting her views about change. “He was not a political person at all until it affected his life,” she said of Mr. Kimmel, referring to his son, who was born in April with a heart ailment. (Mr. Kimmel and Ms. Silverman once dated.) “Sometimes, it takes a personal experience to get woke to things.”

Ms. Silverman, tall and poised, has a warm presence, listening to questions as intently as she answers them. She sometimes shifts between plain-spoken, even folksy slang and her old kewpie doll voice, code-switching between savvy and silly, gimlet-eyed and wide-eyed.
She grew up in Bedford, N.H., in one of few Jewish families in her neighborhood. Her mother ran a community theater and her father inherited the family clothing business, passing along his sense of humor. When Ms. Silverman was a toddler, he taught her how to say a string of curse words. “She’d sit on his lap — short black bangs, adorable round face — and say this, and we’d all laugh,” recalled her older sister Susan Silverman.

Ms. Silverman, whose childhood bedroom ceiling had “I love Steve Martin” written on it, was a comedy prodigy. She told jokes onstage for the first time at 15, and dropped out of college after freshman year at New York University to work clubs; by 22 she joined the cast of “Saturday Night Live.” She lasted only a year, but sketch comedy and sitcoms were never the goal. “She was the rare stand-up back then who didn’t see it as a means,” said Sam Seder, who directed Ms. Silverman in her first film, “Who’s the Caboose?” “Stand-up was the end.”
When asked about her ambition in her first years of New York comedy, she said she wanted to sleep with everyone. “I was so excited about sex once I had it, and I lost my virginity to a comedian, so it was like in front of everyone,” she said. “I was attracted to funny people.” She speaks fondly of her formative days in New York clubs, but also said she now realizes what a “misogynistic culture” she dwelled in.
“I was told: You’re only a real comedian if your material can be said by a male comedian and it still worked,” she said, with exasperation. “I bought that. Looking back, it’s mind-blowing. I accepted talking about the female experience as hack.”
Ms. Silverman eventually pushed past that attitude, telling jokes about sex and dating whose innocent affect belied what she was really saying. Mr. Seder, who dated her in the early 1990s, recalls traveling to New Hampshire with her to perform a benefit given by her mother. On stage Ms. Silverman told a story about how in the middle of licking jelly off her boyfriend’s penis, she realized: “Oh my god, I’m turning into my mother.”

“I couldn’t believe she did that joke, not just in front of her mother, but her entire world,” Mr. Seder said. “But they laughed.”
Over the next decade, Ms. Silverman developed a reputation as a sharp joke writer and performer, but she burst on the national scene in 2001 after saying a racial slur for Chinese people on “Late Night With Conan O’Brien” that drew condemnation and an apology from the talk show. She debated Guy Aoki, of the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans, on “Politically Incorrect.” “That whole Conan controversy made me famous,” she said. “I’m not proud of it but I have to admit it.”

In 2005, Ms. Silverman had a major breakthrough with “Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic,” an influential Off Broadway show turned feature film where she made elegantly crafted jokes in the voice of a naïvely offensive Jewish woman. Building jokes about rape, the Holocaust, AIDS and race, she used what she calls her “unreliable narrator” character to distance herself from her material.
She received many glowing reviews, but a critique from A.O. Scott in The New York Times made her take a hard look at her act. It argued that her kind of ironic, transgressive humor flatters herself and her audience, playing it safe. “Looking back now, I was playing an ignorant character, but I also really was ignorant,” she said. “When A.O. Scott wrote that, it hit me hard. I just felt like it opened up my mind like a good hallucinogeni …”

Ms. Silverman paused, made a bewildered face and repeated the word “hallucinogenic” several times with slightly different pronunciations, tilting her head in a pantomime of confusion. Twice during the interview, she flamboyantly searched for the right way to say a word; she did it once in her test show, turning it into a self-deprecating verbal pratfall.
“I Love You, America” marries a long-running interest in scatological humor and stomping on taboos with a new, more politically conscious voice. In a video segment where she spends time with a family who never met a Jew before, she bonds with their young boy with the great unifier: a fart joke.
Unlike many veteran comics, Ms. Silverman does not lament that political correctness is ruining comedy, saying she no longer uses words like “retard”; on her test show, she brought up “micro-aggressions.”
“If you’re so scared of changing with the times, then you’re old,” she said. “There are comedians I love to pieces who roll their eyes. ‘Oh, another word I can’t say.’ You don’t know enough words?”

The presidential election was clearly a turning point for Ms. Silverman. On the night Donald J. Trump won, Ms. Silverman was walking her dog when her sister called. “She was sobbing, beside herself, like her guts were coming out,” Susan Silverman said, “but in that conversation, she said we have to start listening to each other and can’t go on like this in our own echo chambers.”
Ms. Silverman’s attitudes about ambition have changed too. She said she now puts her career first, adding that while she loves her current boyfriend — the British actor Michael Sheen — the relationship works because he lives an ocean away. “I’ve watched myself over many years give up a lot of things because I’m in relationships,” she said, describing herself as “oddly subservient” in romance. “I’m older now and I don’t want to do that. I want to make stuff that matters and put my whole self into it.”

Ms. Silverman has done more dramatic acting of late (see the current “Battle of the Sexes”) but after a few narrative pilots for television didn’t work out, she decided she wanted to try something closer to stand-up, a show where she plays herself, looks at the camera and talks to people who don’t necessarily agree with her. But it’s not easy.
She invited the conservative comic Dennis Miller to be a guest, but he turned her down. When she noticed that Ivanka Trump followed her on Twitter, she sent her a direct message, saying she has a chance to make a difference. No response, she said. (“I’ve given up on her since.”) And her forays into red state America for her show — she traveled to a small Texas town where President Trump won by 87 percent and spent a day with a family of Trump voters in a suburb outside New Orleans — have led to culture clashes.

In Louisiana, a female Trump voter complained that President Barack Obama gave away “handouts,” while her family talked about being on Medicaid. Ms. Silverman spends more time listening than fact-checking, which may not satisfy liberals who delight in seeing John Oliver or Samantha Bee eviscerate conservatives. At the same time, it’s hard to see Trump voters thinking this segment is for them either.
The most obviously commercial aspect of the show may be Ms. Silverman’s star power. A live-wire performer, she has a sly, teasing sensibility that has always been far too off-kilter to be blandly relatable. Whether she has enough room to roam will likely be crucial to the show’s success.
Reflecting on her interactions with the family in Louisiana, Ms. Silverman said that she had a good time and found agreement on some issues, like same-sex marriage. When asked if this visit made her more hopeful for change, Ms. Silverman weighed her words carefully. “What makes me hopeful is when you’re face to face you can still enjoy and respect each other,” she said. “Did we change minds? No.”
What’s important, she said, is accepting that you might not always be right. Years of therapy have helped her find the joy in realizing when she is wrong. “I am lucky because most people hate it,” she said. “I’ve dated guys who I love to death but they cannot say sorry. It would kill them to say sorry. To me, I love it. It makes the person I’m talking to feel so good. A total high.”
This was apparent in our interview when we disagreed over how to categorize “I Love You, America.” I saw it as a talk show. Ms. Silverman disagreed, associating that genre with topicality and a guest promoting projects. When I said it’s interesting that she resists the term, she responded sharply that it’s interesting that I want to pigeonhole the show. It was tense, but not for long.
She paused, than flashed a big smile. “O.K., I am a host,” she said. “I don’t care, whatever you want to call it.”
On the show, her guests are people who have undergone a change, and it’s clear that Ms. Silverman puts a premium on transformation (Megan Phelps-Roper, who left the Westboro Baptist Church, an ultraconservative group, will be a future guest).

Ms. Silverman finds the uncertainty of her own future exciting. “I might become a staunch Republican,” she said, shrugging. “Joan Rivers said she didn’t really find her voice until 70. So I’m on the edge of my seat.”"

Brazil detains Italian fugitive Battisti leaving country,"Italian former leftist guerrilla Cesare Battisti leaves the headquarters of Federal Police in Sao Paulo March 13, 2015. REUTERS/Nacho Doce
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian highway police on Wednesday detained Cesare Battisti, an Italian former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in his country, as he was attempting to cross the border into Bolivia in a taxi, federal police said.
Battisti was apparently trying to leave Brazil after Italy reportedly asked Brazil’s government to revoke his asylum status and extradite him to serve his prison sentence.
He was stopped by highway police as he was about to cross the border in a Bolivian taxi and was held for possession of a “significant” quantity of undeclared foreign currency, the federal police said in a statement.
Battisti faced life in prison in Italy, where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s, when he belonged to a guerilla group called Armed Proletarians for Communism. He escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in France before fleeing to Brazil to avoid being extradited to Italy.
Battisti’s lawyer, Igor Sant‘Anna, told Reuters that he had sought a habeas corpus injunction last week due to the risk that President Michel Temer’s government could agree to Italy’s request. Habeas corpus is a legal procedure that keeps a government from holding a person without showing cause.
The police statement said he was being held for breaking currency rules.
O Globo newspaper reported last week that Italy had asked the Temer government to review the status of Battisti, who was granted refugee status by former leftist President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva on his last day in office in 2010.
Lula had refused an Italian extradition request, a decision that upset relations between the two countries.

"Hard to tell how good Georgia Tech is after 3-1 start, but they are dangerous.","Hard to tell how good Georgia Tech is after 3-1 start, but they are dangerous.
(Before It's News)
Following Georgia Tech’s 33-7 win over UNC, it’s still hard to tell just how good the Yellow Jackets are. To be fair to the Tar Heels, they are an injury depleted team that’s just plan bad. Georgia Tech controlled the game from start to finish. Last week Georgia Tech beat Pitt 35-17 and in week 2 they defeated Jacksonville State 37-10. Neither of those teams scare anyone.
Georgia Tech’s opening week loss to Tennessee even seems suspect as the Vols simply don’t look very good themselves. Still the Yellow Jackets are just 1 bad defensive quarter on that Labor Night from being 4-0 and ranked around 17th. Their UCF game was cancelled.
Here is the question… Is Georgia Tech good enough to be a threat in the Coastal? You just don’t know. They haven’t beat a team that I would describe as good yet, but minus the 1 bad quarter against Tennessee they’ve been in control of every game they’ve played. This is what I am sure of.
Taquon Marshall is an excellent quarterback. He reminds me of Tevin Washington. Washington always seemed to make the right read, and really knew how to run the offense. Marshall appears to be a more athletic version of Washington. The offense has sputtered from time to time, but for the most part has been pretty good. The defense is certainly improved.
Even against offensively challenged teams like Pitt and UNC, the defense has only given up 24 points. They are far better against 3rd down, and the tackling is better. This isn’t an elite unit, but it doesn’t appear to be the liability we’ve seen in years past.
The soft part of the schedule in now behind Georgia Tech, and the schedule really takes an uptick. In 2 weeks the Yellow Jackets play at Miami, and after that it is Wake Forest, at Clemson, at Virginia, Virginia Tech, Duke and Georgia. That’s 4 top 20 teams, and improved Wake Forest, Virginia and Duke teams.
The pecking order in the Coastal looks pretty clear. Pitt and UNC seem like the bottom of the Coastal. Miami and Virginia Tech are the top. Virginia is better, but not really equipped to win the Coastal. Duke is pretty good, but a notch below Miami and VT as we saw in their 31-6 home loss to Miami. Georgia Tech is the wild card in the Coastal, and I think a dangerous one at that.

"Linklater's war veteran comedy speaks to modern America, says star","LONDON (Reuters) - “Last Flag Flying”, a comedy-drama about Vietnam war veterans, will resonate with Trump’s America, despite, or perhaps because of, its period setting, actor Bryan Cranston said on Sunday after a screening at the London Film Festival.
Set in the United States in December 2003 – when U.S. forces in Iraq were dragging Saddam Hussein out of a “spider hole” - it is the story of three ageing former servicemen who reunite to bury the son of one of them who has been killed in action.
With President Donald Trump saying he could “totally destroy” North Korea and characterizing a dinner with military commanders as “the calm before the storm”, Cranston said “Last Flag Flying” was a timely reminder of the effect on normal Americans of ill-advised military campaigns.
“I think it has a lot of relevance today in the sense that (today) it’s not clear cut as far as the (what are the) intentions of the government or military,” Cranston, acclaimed for his lead role in the TV drama “Breaking Bad”, told Reuters.
“In World War Two, it was the ‘good war’, it was clear and present danger, we had to stop this mad man. Since then, with Vietnam and Iraq, (there are) a lot of questions ... among the troops and the citizens as to if we are doing the right thing and what is the purpose of our being there.”
Cast member Bryan Cranston (R) and director Richard Linklater pose with festival director Claire Stewart as they arrive for the premiere of ""Last Flag Flying"" during the British Film Institute (BFI) London Film Festival at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London, Britain October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde
“Last Flag Flying” was produced by Amazon Studios and directed and co-written by Richard Linklater, whose greatest critical acclaim has been for the naturalistic “Before Sunset” trilogy and the 2014 “Boyhood” which won a slew of Oscar nominations.
Linklater also made comedies including “School of Rock” and “Everybody Wants Some!!”, about skirt-chasing undergraduates. “Last Flag Flying” falls somewhere between the two genres.

The drama and comedy stem from the chemistry between the three leads, each played by a big Hollywood name.
Steve Carell is the awkward shy one who, we assume, was quiet and withdrawn even before the loss of his son. Cranston plays a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking bar owner who is his own best customer, and Laurence Fishburne, is a man who has found God and become an evangelical preacher, preferring to forget the sex and drugs they all indulged in back in ‘Nam.
Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson said the film’s ability to honor the footsoldiers while being critical of the wars they are sent to fight, could hit “an Academy sweet spot, satisfying both the more conservative oldsters and the younger, leftier types.”
Other critics said “Last Flag Flying” lacked the light touch of Linklater’s best work. The Guardian’s Benjamin Lee called it “a half-baked TV movie masquerading as Oscarbait, a curious misstep for the Oscar-nominated indie auteur”."

Trump Administration Formally Lifts Sanctions on Sudan,"But she added, “Any further normalization of ties will require continued progress by the government of Sudan.”
Left unanswered by diplomats was why the rapprochement with Sudan was deemed worthy of continuing while similar détentes with Iran and Cuba have been either excoriated or partly reversed. State Department officials who on Friday briefed reporters on the Sudan policy said their expertise did not extend beyond Africa so they could not answer questions on Iran or Cuba.
The difference with Sudan may be that President Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson have demonstrated little interest in Africa, allowing lower-level diplomats to push forward with a policy they and many academics support.
“Punishing an awful government may be justified and morally satisfying, but for two decades it hasn’t done much good,” said Zach Vertin, who helped forge the new Sudan policy during the Obama administration. “This policy is an attempt to chart a smarter, more nuanced approach.”

Trump administration officials asked the Sudanese government to stop buying weapons from North Korea, a request that was not part of the agreement with Khartoum as negotiated with the Obama administration. Even so, State Department officials emphasized that the North Korean issue would not have been a deal breaker since, as they said, it was important that the United States abide by previous commitments.
Sudan remains on a list of countries that are considered sponsors of terror, and a separate review is underway to determine whether it should be removed from that list, as Khartoum is eager to see. The terror designation means that restrictions remain on foreign assistance and defense sales. Sanctions specifically related to the conflict in Darfur also remain in place.
The sanctions, which had been under suspension and will be lifted permanently as of Oct. 12, include a trade embargo and the blocking of assets held by the Sudanese government that were put in place by executive order in 1997 and 2006. The hope is that by lifting the sanctions permanently, businesses will have the confidence to invest in Sudan, where infrastructure and other needs are acute.
Ibrahim Ghandour, the Sudanese foreign minister, said that “lifting the sanctions means lifting the extortion from the people of Sudan who long suffered from them.”

But Stuart Newberger, a Washington attorney who represents a dozen Americans killed in a 1998 truck bombing against the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, said the Trump administration should have secured a commitment that the Sudanese government would pay billions of dollars in court judgments from lawsuits filed by the victims of that attack and another in Tanzania. The victims claimed that Sudan provided support to the attackers, who were members of Al Qaeda; the attacks elevated Osama bin Laden to the F.B.I.’s Most Wanted list for the first time.
“The Trump administration has today not said a word about the judgments against Sudan,” Mr. Newberger said.
Top State Department officials promised they would press Sudan to resolve the issue."
How gun control advocates could break the NRA's blockade,"That blockade has held for two decades despite a succession of mass shootings over so horrific they have become known simply by their location: Columbine, Aurora, Newtown, San Bernardino, Orlando and now Las Vegas.
With Republicans skeptical of limiting access to firearms now holding the White House and both chambers of Congress, Washington in the near future is unlikely to approve anything more than minor restrictions acceptable to the NRA. And even such modest measures as tightened limits on the ""bump fire stock"" that the Las Vegas shooter used to make his attack more lethal may ultimately face an uphill climb. Delay has been a critical tool for gun control opponents after past mass shootings, and congressional Republicans can use their control of the legislative calendar to defer serious debate until the shock and horror of the Las Vegas attack has faded.
But over the longer term, time may be on the side of those advocating for tighter limits on access to guns. Gun control advocates face structural barriers in Congress -- particularly the bias toward small and gun-friendly rural states inherent in the allocation of two Senators to every state -- that will always leave them confronting a narrow path. Yet underlying changes in the two parties' demographic and geographic bases of support may offer a path toward eventually circumventing the NRA-led blockade -- particularly if gun control advocates can update the balancing act that Clinton employed in his two landmark victories.
How Clinton got past the NRA
Stephen Sposato, whose wife was killed when a gunman invaded the San Francisco law firm where she worked, left, and Marc Klass, whose daughter was kidnapped and killed, right, look on after President Bill Clinton signed the $30 billion crime bill on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on Sept. 13, 1994.
Clinton beat the NRA in two epic legislative confrontations: The 1993 ""Brady bill"" legislation that required mandatory background checks for most gun purchases and the 1994 ban on semi-automatic assault weapons.
When Clinton passed these bills, Democrats held majorities in both chambers of Congress. That control of the calendar was critical to the passage of both bills. But Democratic unity wasn't the key to his success. In fact, on both the Brady bill and assault weapon ban, Clinton faced widespread defections from rural, southern and mountain west Democrats, including many of the center-right party legislators then known as ""blue dogs."" Fully 69 House Democrats voted against the Brady bill in November 1993, and in May 1994, 77 Democrats opposed the assault weapon ban. Meanwhile, eight Democratic Senators voted against the Brady bill and a different eight opposed the assault ban.
Clinton overcame those defections by attracting substantial support from congressional Republicans in both chambers, particularly those from suburban districts in culturally cosmopolitan and urbanized states. It might seem inconceivable today, but in the House, 54 Republicans supported the Brady bill. That represented nearly one-third of those who voted on the measure, and included three Republicans from Illinois, four from Pennsylvania, six from New York, six from California and all six from New Jersey. The assault ban was a tougher vote for House Republicans, but Clinton still drew 38 of them, just over one-fifth who voted, mostly from the same states where he attracted support on the Brady Bill. Several more House Republicans (46 in all) backed the final comprehensive crime bill that included the assault ban.
In the Senate, over one-third of Republicans voted for the background checks and about one-fifth supported the assault ban. Seven Senate Republicans then defied a party filibuster to win approval for the final crime bill that included the assault weapon ban.
What's happened since the early '90s
Those votes in the first half of Clinton's first term have proven the modern legislative high point for gun control advocates. After the Columbine high school shooting, Clinton pushed in 1999 for legislation centered on closing the so-called ""gun show loophole."" That passed the Republican-controlled Senate by a single vote, but with support from just six GOP Senators. The effort died in the House when just 15% of Republicans, who by then held the majority in that chamber as well, supported the decisive amendment.
For over the next decade, support for gun control wavered among Democrats, while opposition hardened among Republicans. Neither presidential nominees John Kerry in 2004 nor Barack Obama in 2008 stressed new gun control measures.
Obama's efforts fell short
That long silence ended in 2013 when Obama revived the proposal to close the gun show loophole after the massacre of elementary school students in Newtown, Connecticut. His resurrection of the issue was prompted by revulsion at the sickening attack, but also reflected the shifting nature of the Democratic coalition: Obama had won a decisive reelection just the year before despite a weak performance among the rural and blue-collar white voters who polls have always shown to be the most resistant to restrictions on guns.
Obama's effort to close the gun show loophole drew a 54-vote majority, but fell to a Republican filibuster. Just five of 55 Democrats and independents allied with them voted no (including then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for procedural reasons), but only four of 45 Senate Republicans voted yes -- a far lower percentage than supported the key gun control initiatives during Clinton's first term. The Republican opponents included senators from Ohio, New Hampshire, Arizona and Florida -- the kind of heavily suburbanized states that had provided most of the Republican gun control support in the 1990s.

That resistance illuminated the critical shift in the gun debate since Clinton's era-and the most plausible path toward any future limits. Most attention on the deteriorating legislative prospects for gun control has focused on the sharp turn toward the GOP over the past two decades in the rural, Southern and heartland states and districts that once elected large numbers of center-right Democrats. But as this history shows, most of those Democrats opposed gun control anyway. The more consequential change since the 1990s has been the willingness of more Congressional Republicans with large white-collar and suburban constituencies to vote with the NRA. (That shift has grown so dramatic that even about half of the roughly two dozen House Republicans from districts that Hillary Clinton carried last fall are now co-sponsoring NRA-backed legislation requiring every state to recognize concealed carry permits granted in any other state.)
The road ahead for gun control advocates
If there is a way forward for federal gun control in years ahead, it's more likely to come from flipping more of those suburban Republicans than from demanding absolute unity from the remaining Democrats with significant rural constituencies (much less converting any of the Republicans who represent such places.)
Gun ownership and attitudes toward gun policy now almost exactly follow the larger cultural and geographic divide between the parties. Polling from the Pew Research Center this year found that while 46% of rural residents and 41% of whites without a college degree own a gun, that's true of just 28% of suburban residents, 26% of college-educated whites, 24% of African-Americans, and 19% of Hispanics.
JUST WATCHED Trump open to discussing ban on 'bump stocks' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump open to discussing ban on 'bump stocks' 00:51
Across a wide array of issues, Trump's belligerent presidency may solidify the GOP hold on non-urban and working-class whites, the population groups most likely to own guns. But many of those same policies-on issues from the environment, to immigration and trade, to access to contraception-are straining the party's connection with white-collar whites, while deepening its hole with minority voters-the groups that are least likely to own guns. The key to reviving the gun control cause is not to bridge or reverse this larger cultural and geographic sorting between the parties -- but to intensify it.
Trump's redefinition of the GOP is imposing new pressure on House and Senate Republicans with substantial urban and/or suburban constituencies -- and could create a new opening for gun control advocates. Their challenge is to make the issue more pertinent to white-collar voters who are already uneasy over Trump's direction, particularly on cultural and racially tinged issues. Those are voters that polls show support most gun control ideas, but are uncertain they will seriously reduce violence and have not prioritized them as voting issues.

Peter Ambler, Executive Director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, the pro-gun control group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, says those white-collar voters and districts ""will be the basis of our political program in 2018."" The group's political action committee, he says, will likely focus its efforts on House Republicans from suburban districts in California, the East Coast, and Midwestern population centers like Minneapolis who are aligning with the NRA more than their counterparts did in the 1990s. ""They have learned some very bad instincts over the past 15 years or so,"" Ambler says.
This is where Clinton's experience could prove most relevant. He embedded his gun control proposals in a larger agenda to combat crime, including support for hiring more local police. Aspects of that blueprint -- particularly greater reliance on mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes -- proved misguided. But overall, Clinton built a framework that made more Republican legislators from big metropolitan areas (and even some Democrats with big rural constituencies) comfortable with including restrictions on gun access in an overall plan to confront crime and violence -- issues with renewed relevance in some swing suburban communities today.
""It was always just one piece of a larger anti-crime strategy,"" said Bruce Reed, who served as Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser. ""Violent crime was at record levels and we couldn't go on fighting over whether more jails or fewer guns were the answer. What we were hearing from law enforcement around the country was that they needed all the tools we could give them.""
Those hoping to reshape the future debate over guns might profitably take a page from that past."

The final field is set for the championship chase with Boston at Houston and New York at Cleveland tonight, and with Arizona at Los Angeles and Chicago at Washington tomorrow. I see that the Astros clobbered Chris Sale, that’s not a good sign for the Red Sox. Indians-Yankees seems like a tossup to me, two great bullpens. The Diamondbacks used their two best pitchers already and that seems like a big advantage for the Dodgers. Nationals-Cubs seems like another tossup, defending champs often don’t go away easily. I’ve never been much of a prognosticator so I won’t go further than that. I don’t have a rooting interest, really, I’m partial to Cleveland, that winning streak was something, and I like Terry Francona. In the NL it’s all about who has the best shot at beating LA, right? And I’ve no idea. The boys in blue are very strong this year and have a lot of good players. But this is the post-season tournament and anything can happen, as we know. I don’t expect to write much about these games but I had to post something if just to move my previous post off the front page!

One start means nothing in the scheme of things, but it was nice to see Masahiro Tanaka finish with a bang tossing 7.0 shutout innings allowing 3 H and 0 BB while striking out 15. It was another ace performance from Stephen Strasburg, who tossed 7.2 shutout innings allowing 2 H and 2 BB, striking out 8, to finish the year at 15-4 with a 2.52 ERA. Mike Trout posted a big day, going 2-3 with 2 HR, 2 RBI and 2 R. What else happened on the field that we need to know about? Let’s take a look…
1) Greg Bird continues to find his footing…
He went 2-2 with 2 RBI. Extending his hitting streak to 7 games. Over the streak he’s gone 10-24 with 4 HR, 11 RBI and 6 R. Even more impressive is his 4 K vs. 2 BB over the stretch, and while the end game numbers stink he’s finally showing what he can do when he’s healthy and finding his footing. Strikeouts are going to be key (he entered the day with a career 28.0% strikeout rate) and he’ll likely be more of a platoon player, but he has the potential to hit .280+ with 30 HR when things are right. He’s certainly not a player to ignore, and this late season surge is showing us why.
2) Is it time to ignore Gerrit Cole’s “upside”…
He was unimpressive in his final start, allowing 3 ER on 8 H and 1 BB, striking out 7, over 5.1 IP and finished with an average line of 12-12 with a 4.26 ERA and 1.25 WHIP. The big issue is obviously home runs (31 HR over 203.0 IP), but we obviously can’t ignore the skillset that he does bring to the table as he entered the day with an 8.61 K/9, 2.46 BB/9 and 45.8% groundball rate. Prior to ’17 he had never posted a HR/FB greater than 9.4% (he was under 7% each of the past two seasons), but entered the day with a 16.1% mark (he did avoid allowing a home run yesterday). If he can get that number back in check he’s going to be a Top 25 starter, so don’t ignore him as a post-hype sleeper heading into ’18.
3) Matt Harvey goes out with a whisper…
To call Harvey’s 2017 campaign anything more than a significant disappointment would be a mistake, as he finished up with a 6.70 ERA and 1.69 WHIP over 92.2 IP. Taking on the Phillies yesterday he allowed 4 ER on 7 H and 3 BB, striking out 3, over 4.0 IP as he’s struggled mightily with both home runs (21) and walks (67) over his 92.2 IP. We can dig into any numbers we want, but they are irrelevant. The question comes down to the injuries and whether or not he can get back to the pitcher he once was, and that’s a complete mystery. At this point he’s nothing more than a late round flier.
4) Alex Bregman continues to show his value…
He provided all of the offense for the Astros yesterday, going 3-4 with 1 HR, 3 RBI and 1 R, and after looking like a significant disappointment early on has completely turned his season around. He’s currently on a seven-game hitting streak and after hitting .256 with 8 HR and 8 SB in the first half, he’s now hitting .322 with 11 HR, 44 RBI, 48 R and 9 SB in the second half. The big differences is that he’s reduced his strikeout rate (17.0% to 13.6% entering the day) and had better luck (.291 BABIP to .333), with both numbers being highly realistic. His second half numbers are for real and he easily could replicate them over an entire season.
5) Trevor Bauer makes a big lead stand up…
The Indians jumped on the White Sox early, racking up 10 R, so it was an easy day for Trevor Bauer who took it and shutdown Chicago allowing 1 R on 4 H and 0 BB, striking out 7, over 6.0 IP. He’s pitched well overall in the second half, including allowing 2 ER or less in seven of his final nine starts. Of course he still entered the day with a 1.31 WHIP in the second half, as he carried an elevated BABIP (.338) and benefited from an unsustainable 87.1% strand rate. With a 22.5% line drive rate and 15.1% HR/FB (he allowed another home run yesterday) it’s easy to call the second half more of a mirage and, like his 17 wins, not a reason to buy in.
6) A strong finish for Ozzie Albies…
He filled the box score last night, going 3-5 with 1 HR, 1 RBI, 2 R and 1 SB. Obviously a four-game hitting streak doesn’t mean much in the scheme of things, but it definitely shows his potential as he’s gone 9-18 with 1 HR, 3 RBI, 2 R and 4 SB (he has 5 SB over his past five games). He’s now hitting .288 in the Majors, though we’d like to see a bit of an improvement in his plate discipline (10.6% SwStr%, 33.5% O-Swing% entering the day) but that should come with experience. He’s maturing in his power and has the speed, meaning he could take a significant step forward come 2018.
7) Trevor Story bringing back memories of ’16…
It’s been a disappointing season overall for Story, though he’s finishing strong. Moved to the cleanup spot yesterday he went 3-4 with 1 HR, 2 RBI and 2 R and now has 2 HR, 9 RBI and 5 R over his final three games. He’s still hitting just .239 on the season, though he does have 24 HR and 7 SB. We all know that the problem is his ability to make consistent contact, entering the day with a 34.5% strikeout rate and 14.2% SwStr%. He’s going to provide some power and speed (he could easily be a 30/10 player), but unless he cuts down on the strikeouts the average is going to be a liability.
8) Is Whit Merrifield for real…
He went 2-4 with 1 HR, 1 RBI and 1 R yesterday, putting him at .289 with 19 HR, 78 RBI, 80 R and 33 SB on the season. If you want to be picky you will point towards his .326 OBP as a reason to knock him, and that’s definitely a fair point for a player hitting atop the batting order. He could stand to improve upon his 4.7% walk rate, but he does make consistent contact (7.8% SwStr%), hits the ball hard (22.0% line drive rate) and has the speed to further improve upon his BABIP (.310). The question is going to be if he can maintain a 20 HR type pace, but there’s little question that he’s a .280+ hitter with the ability to go 15/25 once again. Throw in the fact that there’s really no reason to believe that he can’t maintain this year’s explosion and he’s going to be hard to knock.
9) Chase Anderson finishes with a strong showing…
Taking on the Cardinals he allowed 1 ER on 3 H and 1 BB, striking out 5, over 7.0 IP to finish the season at 12-4 with a 2.74 ERA and 1.09 WHIP over 141.1 IP. Of course, before we get too excited and consider him a Top 30 starter heading into 2018 we have to keep in mind that there was significant luck behind the production (80.6% strand rate, .265 BABIP) and also could easily regress in the number of home runs allowed (39.2% groundball rate, 0.89 HR/9 and a less than favorable home ballpark). Anderson has overpay written all over him at this point, and it will be interesting to see where he lands on ranking lists heading into 2018.
10) Another struggle for Tyler Skaggs…
Taking on the Mariners he allowed 3 ER on 6 H and 1 BB, striking out 7, over 4.2 IP as a pair of home runs were the big blows. That’s been the story for him, with 13 HR allowed over 85.0 IP, though we also can’t overlook his pedestrian 8.1% SwStr% and 29.6% O-Swing%. Always battling injuries and with limited upside he’s looking like a 4.25ish ERA pitcher and at this point that’s simply not someone we’d be looking to target.

By Richard Larsen
The symbolism employed by some NFL players is not just substantially vapid but is actually counterproductive to their intended objectives. Most Americans’ patriotic sensibilities are affronted by their antics. If sports and entertainment personalities would think through the vacuous symbolism typically evidenced by such remonstrations, and their unintended consequences, they would search for more efficacious means of highlighting important issues.
Just over a year ago, former San Francisco 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the pre-game national anthem as “a silent protest of racial inequality in the United States.” The act itself became the focus, rather than the cause, as some heralded his “courage” but most were chagrined by his lack of respect for the flag representing the nation that gave him so much opportunity. And after a year, what good has been affected by his silent demonstration for “racial inequality?” Clearly, his intent and cause has been eclipsed by his questionable symbolic gesture.
And after last weekend, Kaepernick’s message is even more obfuscated. As more NFL players have seen the personalized attention they can grab by following the former 49er quarterback’s poor example, the fad has grown to the point where the President of the U.S. castigated them, claiming that the S.O.B.’s should “be fired.” Consequently, many teams were no-shows for the national anthem prior to their weekend games, and in some cases, entire teams showed up to take a knee. What was initially a “silent protest of racial inequality” has morphed into an anti-Trump demonstration.
There are two major victims of this petty act. The biggest is the unity fostered by the respect afforded our flag and our National Anthem. Standing for the Anthem or the Pledge of Allegiance is not endemically political. It is patriotic and unifying, but not political. It has nothing to do with party declarations or with governmental policy. It’s an expression of respect for the nation that was uniquely founded on principles of freedom and inalienable rights granted by God.
The second victim is the NFL itself. With so many NFL players, teams, and owners making of the Anthem a political statement, they’ve shown disrespect to the nation which affords them the freedom to pursue their dreams and make a ton of money in the process. And by so doing, the NFL is alienating itself from a significant part of its fan base. Nearly 80% of respondents to a Dallas Morning News online poll object to the politicization of the National Anthem at game time.
Even more convincingly, a new poll conducted the first of this week by Remington Research Group found that fully half (50%) of Americans are “less likely to watch football because of the protests.” Of those watching less, 69% indicated it was because of the players “using the NFL as a stage for their political views.”
The poll indicates that about 70 percent of Americans consider themselves a “fan of the NFL,” but also that 80 percent of Americans “want less politics from sporting events.” And unsurprisingly, only 12% of those NFL viewers polled have a favorable opinion of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for his abysmal handling of the whole affair.
With a scant 2.3% margin for error, the poll spells financial doom for the League, as TV advertising revenue drops precipitously, attendance at games (especially in palatial stadiums largely funded by public dollars) declines, NFL gear sales drop, and DirecTV for the first time allows full refunds to subscribers of the NFL package.
Perhaps even more significant, is the fact that the poll included participants who voted in the 2016 presidential election. Consequently, the divisive and questionable antics of the League will likely widen the wedge between the protests of the left and average Americans. The political implications are inestimable at this juncture, but certainly do not portend favorably for the left.
One component of the Remington poll should give pause to the entire entertainment and sports industries. Respondents overwhelmingly (80%) “want less politics from sporting events.” It is entirely conceivable that such a sentiment is applicable to Hollywood movies, musical groups, comedians, and other forms of entertainment. After all, we turn to entertainment for just that, entertainment, not for political statements or influence peddling.
Perhaps all genres of entertainment and sports would find increased support and financial success if viewers and fans weren’t constantly bombarded by ideological and politically correct messaging.
There are undoubtedly much more efficacious means of bringing attention to important issues than what we’re witnessing from the NFL today. And the most efficacious would certainly not consist of imaging that simultaneously insults and offends 80% of their fan base!
Most Americans are proud Americans and treasure the icons of our national identity which historically have unified, rather than divided us. The clear message to the sports and entertainment industries seems to be, “If you want our support, don’t offend and alienate us by politicizing everything, especially our national symbols.”

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Germany’s DEA Deutsche Erdoel won the rights to partner with Mexican national oil company Pemex on its onshore Ogarrio project, the industry regulator said on Wednesday.
The tie-up marks only the third joint venture between the Mexican oil giant and a equity partner since a sweeping energy opening finalized in 2014 ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly and allowed the firm to jointly develop projects with private and foreign oil companies.
Ogarrio is a 60-square mile (156 sq km) field located in Tabasco state believed to contain 54 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in proven, probable and possible reserves."

"10 of Asia's highest bars: Where drinks, skyscapers meet","(CNN) — Thanks to rapid development over the past decade, Asia has become synonymous with futuristic architecture and cloud-piercing skyscrapers.
It makes sense: After all, seven of the top 10 tallest buildings in the world are in Asia.
And inside those towers? Many of the region's skyscrapers contain lofty bars, pairing classy cocktails and unparalleled views.
For a sky-high experience coupled with spectacular sights, here are a few of the tallest bars in Asia.
1. Alfresco 64 - A Chivas Bar
Incredible views, rare pours greet visitors to the new Alfresco 64 bar at Bangkok's Lebua hotel.
Where: Bangkok, Thailand
The recently opened Alfresco 64 - A Chivas Bar, atop Tower Club at Lebua hotel in Bangkok , has claimed the title of world's highest alfresco whisky bar.
Located on the 64th floor, the bar is the latest addition to The Dome, a popular restaurant and bar destination atop Lebua hotel.
Travelers will also find Sky Bar (which made an appearance in ""The Hangover Part II"") and Flute, A Perrier Jouët Bar (the world's highest Champagne bar).
Focusing on exclusive nips, Alfresco 64 is powered by Chivas Regal. The Scottish whisky brand has even produced a special Lebua blend for the bar.
Even if you don't care for whisky, it's hard to argue with the views, which showcase the Bangkok skyline and Chao Phraya River from a bird's eye vantage, 800 feet above the city streets.
Tower Club at Lebua , 64/F, Tower Club at Lebua, 1055 Silom Road, Bangrak, Bangkok 10500; +66 2624 9555

2. Ozone
Where: Hong Kong
You can't round up a list of sky bars without Ozone -- the highest hotel bar in the world on the 118th floor of The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong
Set atop the International Commerce Centre (ICC) on Hong Kong's Kowloon Peninsula, the ultra-modern space is a popular stop on the tourist trail.
To reach the bar, travelers take a special elevator which gradually dims its lights as it ascends to the 118th floor.
From there, a moody blue-lit room comes into view -- picture contemporary geometric decor, a white marble bar and lounge-like seating.
The spacious terrace offers the best views, where guests can sip on a meticulously made martini while admiring 180-degree views of the city's iconic skyline and Victoria Harbour.
During Hong Kong's humid summers, reach for one of the chilled signature cocktails -- the Basilic is especially refreshing with gin, basil, green apple, lime and yuzu foam.
Ozone , 118/F, International Commerce Centre, 1 Austin Rd West, Kowloon, Hong Kong; +852 2263 2270
3. 1-Altitude
Where: Singapore
As the highest bar in Singapore -- and the highest alfresco bar in the world -- 1-Altitude crowns One Raffles Place tower in the center of town.
It's actually more than just a bar, with several levels of dining and drinking venues stretching from the 61st to 63rd floors -- the highlight being the rooftop.
Sporting 360-degree views, there's nothing but a slender glass panel to impede the vista below.
Of course, Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer dominate the view, but it's also possible to see smaller neighborhoods and quays.
If the neon lighting doesn't give it away, the bar is best known for its swanky parties, live music and DJ nights -- getting progressively clubbier as the night goes on.
It's also a top spot for sunsets, though it's best to make reservations in advance to ensure a table.
1-Altitude , 63/F, One Raffles Place Shopping Mall, 1 Raffles Place, Singapore, 048616; +65 6438 0410
4. Bar 81
Bar 81 is the highest bar in South Korea.
Where: Seoul, South Korea
The moment Bar 81 opened on the 81st floor of the Signiel Seoul hotel -- inside the new Lotte World Tower -- it instantly became the highest bar in the country.
At least, the highest bar that's accessible to the general public.
The hotel also has a secret restaurant and bar, called Signiel Club, on the 107th floor -- but that's members and VIPs only.
The title was basically a given, considering that the 555-meter-tall Lotte World Tower is the highest building in South Korea and the fifth tallest tower in the world.
But a postal code in the clouds isn't the only thing Bar 81 has going for it.
This sophisticated spot specializes in Champagne, with more than 80 labels on offer -- the largest menu in South Korea.
To drive the point home, there's a glitzy glass art installation overhead, meant to resemble the bubbles in your glass.
Bar 81 , 81/F, Signiel Seoul, Lotte World Tower, 300 Olympic-ro, Songpa-gu, Seoul, Korea; +82 2 3213 1000
5. Cloud 9
Where: Shanghai, China
The most iconic bar in China's futuristic commercial capital, Cloud 9 at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai is a sophisticated spot to savor the city's neon-lit skyline.
Decked out in mahogany and chrome, the posh bar wraps around the 87th floor with intimate nooks, terraced levels, and dividing columns that offer a bit more privacy than your typical open-plan rooftop.
From the western side of the building, the bar seems to hover over the Bund -- from everywhere else, it's urban sprawl in all directions.
If you're celebrating something, this is the place -- there's an impressive Champagne collection, as well as classic cocktails and bar snacks.
Cloud 9 , 87/F, Grand Hyatt Shanghai, Jin Mao Tower, 88 Century Avenue, Pudong, Shanghai, China, 200121; +86 21 5047 8838
6. Bridge Bar
Where: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
One of Malaysia's highest bars can be found in the capital of Kuala Lumpur, in a precarious position on the 28th floor of the GTower Hotel.
The Bridge Bar features floor-to-ceiling windows and a few glass floor panels -- so you won't need three martinis to feel like you're walking on air.
By day, the place has a retro-chic atmosphere with winged leather chairs, saddle benches and intimate table arrangements.
But come nightfall, blue lighting ricochets around the mirrored ceilings for a trippy, energetic vibe.
Looking for the highest bar in Malaysia? On the 57th floor of Petronas Tower 3, travelers will find Marini's on 57 -- an Italian address with a dining room, lounge and terrace.
Bridge Bar , 199, Jalan Tun Razak, 50400 Kuala Lumpur; +603 2168 1919

7. Rock Bar Bali at Ayana
Rock Bar Ayana overlooks the Indian Ocean.
Where: Bali, Indonesia
Rock Bar Bali at Ayana may not be set atop a skyscraper, but the bar still provides a gravity-defying experiences.
Located on the edge of a cliff along Jimbaran Bay, in central Bali, Indonesia, travelers reach the bar via cable car, with dramatic cliffs on either side.
At 46 feet above the crashing waves of the Indian Ocean, the bar is the island's premier sunset spot.
Come 5 p.m., the place is usually full of stylish couples who've come for the sunset drinks and signature popcorn-fried chicken.
As the night goes on, Rock Bar turns into a dance club with performances from a rotating roster of international DJs who perform from a booth that's been carved directly into the rock face.
Rock Bar Bali at Ayana , Ayana Resort and Spa, Jl. Karang Mas Estate, Jimbaran, Bali 80364, Indonesia; +62 361 702 222
8. Rooftop Bar
Where: Tokyo, Japan
Already checked off the Park Hyatt Tokyo's New York Bar, of ""Lost in Translation"" fame?
There's another show-stopping skybar in town that's worth a visit.
Atop the 52nd floor of Toranomon Hills tower, the Rooftop Bar at the Andaz Tokyo hotel is the highest bar in the city.
The terrace has a retro-Zen design -- all very polished and elegant, with white couches and a few bird's nest hanging chairs -- while floor-to-ceiling windows frame Tokyo Bay on one side, and the dense city streets on the other.
The specialties here are tea- and fruit-based cocktails, but classic cocktails, Champagnes and sakes are also on hand should you prefer to keep it simple.
Rooftop Bar , 52/F, Andaz Hotel, 1-23-4, Toranomon, Minato-ku; +81 03 6830 7739

9. 28 Skybar Lounge
Where: Melbourne, Australia
Decked out in retro-chic furniture and polished chrome, 28 Skybar Lounge in Melbourne is one of the most sophisticated bars in the city.
On the top floor of Crown Melbourne Hotel, just steps from the Yarra River downtown, the lounge bar brings together spectacular city views, a cosmopolitan vibe and locally sourced wines.
The cocktail menu is worth a look too, with signatures including the Sky High Royal -- a triple threat with Blue Curacao, peach schnapps and sparkling wine.
While the sleek interiors scream fine dining, the bar menu is actually relatively approachable, featuring mini wagyu sliders, BBQ pulled pork buns, and bruschetta.
28 Skybar Lounge , 8 Whiteman St, Melbourne, Southbank, VIC 3006, Australia; +61 3 9292 8384
10. Vertigo and Moon Bar
Vertigo and Moon Bar overlooks Bangkok.
Where: Bangkok, Thailand
Home to one of the best rooftops in Bangkok, the Banyan Tree hotel provides two distinct rooftop experiences -- both on the 61st floor.
A popular after-work spot for the city's stylish set, Moon Bar provides a glamorous alfresco lounge with soft blue lighting, panoramic views, live jazz and fresh cocktails to take the edge off Thailand's omnipresent heat.
Just a few steps down, romantic Vertigo restaurant offers wining and dining for those who plan to linger.
Complete with crisp white tablecloths, the restaurant is best known for surf 'n' turf, so expect barbecued seafood and massive steaks.
The signature sundowner? A Vertigo Sunset Malibu -- essentially, pineapple, cranberry, lime and a hit of Malibu rum.
It's advised to arrive early, around 5 p.m., in order to stake out a spot and watch the sun set.

Wildfires prompt evacuations in California's wine country,"(Reuters) - Wildfires swept through California’s wine country on Monday, forcing thousands of residents in Napa and Sonoma counties to flee and destroying hundreds of homes and businesses, state officials and local media reported.
At least six wildfires, some out of control, engulfed the region in thick, billowing smoke that drifted into San Francisco and Oakland and prompted California Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency for Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties.
More than 1,000 residents had been evacuated, CalFire spokesman Will Powers said in a telephone interview. The blazes had damaged critical infrastructure and threatened thousands of homes, the governor’s office said.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported thousands of people had been evacuated and hundreds of buildings and homes were destroyed.
There were no reports of fatalities or serious injuries.
Patients at Kaiser Hospital in Santa Rosa were being removed early Monday morning, according to NBC Bay Area reporter Laura Garcia. “Gurneys being brought out, people in wheelchairs and walkers loaded in cars,” Garcia wrote on Twitter.
Officials said strong, dry winds were fanning the flames and asked residents in mandatory evacuation zones to leave immediately for local shelters, according to reports on a local NBC TV news affiliate.
San Francisco authorities issued an air quality alert due to smoke from the blazes, warning residents to close windows, limit outdoor activities and keep pets inside, according to text messages sent by the city’s emergency notification system.
Since Sunday, firefighters have been battling a 200-acre (81 hectare) wildfire in Napa County, about 70 miles (113 km) north of San Francisco in an area known for its vineyards, according to the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The “Atlas Fire” was burning in the hills above Napa County and had damaged several buildings. As of Monday morning, firefighters had made no headway containing it.
At least three other fires were burning near Calistoga, a small Napa Valley city known for its wineries, forcing evacuations from homes, shopping centers and hospitals, according to the Napa County Sheriff’s Office.
In Sonoma County, fires also forced all schools in Santa Rosa City to close for the day.

The dying art of the great song intro,"Image caption Clean Bandit have squeezed the intros in their hits
Great song intros, where a tune builds up before the vocal kicks in, are becoming an endangered species as fickle music fans skip tracks if they don't get immediate gratification.
That's the view of the man who co-produced two Clean Bandit number ones this year, and it's backed up by stats.
The average intro time has dropped from more than 20 seconds to five seconds since the mid-1980s, research has found.
Producer Mark Ralph said it is because the rise of streaming services means it's now much easier to move on to the next song if you're not instantly hooked.
Spotify vs vinyl
""Attention spans have now decreased and that is potentially down to the ease with which you can chop and change between pieces of music if you're bored,"" he told BBC News.
""If you imagine trying to do that with one piece of vinyl, if you get bored in the first 10 seconds, to take it off the turntable, find another record, put it on and start again is quite a long-winded process.
""Nowadays, if you're sitting on Spotify and get bored within 10 seconds, you just flick a button and you're on to the next thing. I think you have to grab peoples' attention much more quickly.""
Image caption Sam Smith's voice arrives almost immediately in Too Good At Goodbyes
Ralph worked on Clean Bandit's smash Rockabye, in which Sean Paul's vocal began after just a second; and Symphony, a number one in April, in which the vocal appeared after a whole seven seconds.
Three of this year's other UK number ones have had intros that lasted just a second or two before the vocals kicked in - DJ Khaled and Rihanna's Wild Thoughts; Artists for Grenfell's charity version of Bridge Over Troubled Water; and the current chart-topper, Sam Smith's Too Good At Goodbyes.
Feels, the mega-hit created by Calvin Harris, Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry and Big Sean, goes for 30 seconds before the main vocal arrives - but even that intro is punctuated by cries of ""hey!"", ""oh yeah!"" and ""ha!"".
In research published earlier this year, Ohio State University doctoral student Hubert Leveille Gauvin found that intro lengths had dropped by 78% between 1986 and 2015.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Katy Perry can't keep quiet during the Feels intro
""That's insane, but it makes sense,"" Gauvin said. ""The voice is one of the most attention-grabbing things there is in music.
""It's survival of the fittest - songs that manage to grab and sustain listeners' attention get played and others get skipped. There's always another song.
""If people can skip so easily and at no cost, you have to do something to grab their attention.""
There's another reason musicians want to grab fans' attention. If a tune is played for less than 30 seconds on Spotify, it doesn't count as a play and they don't get paid.
Those are factors that songwriters and producers are aware of when crafting their future hits, Mark Ralph says.
""I think they're talking about it a lot because obviously it's in their interests to be as successful as they possibly can, and they want to have their tracks streamed as many times and played on the radio as many times as they can.""

"Ashley J Announces her New Empowering and Energetic Pop Single, “Unbreakable,” Releasing 10/6/17!","Ashley J Announces her New Empowering and Energetic Pop Single, “Unbreakable,” Releasing 10/6/17!
(Before It's News)
On October 6, 2017 Ashley J will return with her new follow-up pop single “Unbreakable,” the second single from Ashley’s forthcoming EP, slated for an early 2018 release.
Orlando, FL, September 25, 2017 - On October 6, 2017 Ashley J will return with her new follow-up pop single “Unbreakable,” the second single from Ashley’s forthcoming EP, slated for an early 2018 release. “Trapped,” her first single and video received tremendous media praise and hit #6 on the European Independent Music Charts. “Unbreakable” will be released via her own imprint Bombshell Music, Inc.
The Orlando based songwriter/singer showcases her independent and liberating lyrical style in her new song, “Unbreakable.” She collaborated with UK’s established producers, Jamie Sellers and Warwick Matthews to produce this buoyant new track. Ashley’s airy and enticing vocals weave through dreamy piano melodies and bouncy synths. This light-hearted single takes listeners on an uplifting journey and showcases Ashley’s authentic pop style.
“I wrote and recorded ‘Unbreakable’ in London. It was one of my favorite writing sessions because their energy was so natural. The song literally wrote itself and came alive in the studio. I was just ending a relationship and this song was my final phase of getting through it. I found an undeniable power within, and channeled it with this song that closed the chapter and opened a new one at the same time. This will forever be one of my favorites,” says Ashley J.
“Unbreakable,” focuses on overcoming heartbreak and moving on for the better. She chronicles past experiences, noting that she has been through a lot. However she now knows better and is going to make her heart “unbreakable.” This empowering song is intended to encourage and enable women to be free and embrace their independence.
This writing technique is definitely no stranger to Ashley J; she revealed it in the past with her hit single, “Dare Ya” which earned her a Top 10 Billboard chart spot in 2016. The following year, Ashley J unraveled a different side to her storytelling with her single “Trapped.” The song described a dark infatuation with a partner whom she couldn’t break free from, which was released earlier this year. “Trapped” continues to climb the European Independent Music Charts, reaching a sweet spot of #2.
About Ashley J:
Growing up in Orlando, the multi-talented songwriter/singer was influenced by Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson and her all time musical hero, Dolly Parton, Ashley J started songwriting and singing at a very early age. Her musical style intertwines unapologetic pop with enticing electronic melodies. She earned a BA degree in Business Law from the University of North Texas and attended the Dr. Phillips High School of Performing Arts in Orlando, where she scored leading roles in theatre, dance and musical productions.

The Chicago Bears versus the Green Bay Packers Quick Injury Analysis,"The Chicago Bears versus the Green Bay Packers Quick Injury Analysis
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
By Bryan Dietzler
The Chicago Bears will face their biggest rival, the Green Bay Packers, at Lambeau Field this Thursday night in Green Bay. The following is a quick review of the injury report for both the Bears and Packers and what each injury means to both teams.
Chicago Bears
Tom Compton-OT/G-Compton practiced in full on Monday and appears to be ready for the game. The Bears may need his services Thursday.
Quintin Demps-SS-He will be out with a broken forearm for this and the next few games. Adrian Amos, last year’s starter at free safety, will take his place.
Hroniss Grasu-C-Grasu has been limited in practice all week with a hand injury and is questionable for tonight’s game. If he is out, that tightens up the depth at the center position and may force some reshuffling.
Nick Kwiatkoski-LB-After tearing his pectoral muscle against the Buccaneers, he won’t be available for this game leaving Christian Jones and John Timu to man his position. Hopefully, they will be able to continue to step up.
Josh Sitton-RG-Sitton did not play in last week’s game and was limited in practice this week with a rib injury. Consider him a game-time decision that could cause some reshuffling on the offensive line for the second week in a row.
Akiem Hicks-DE-Hicks was just added to the injury report with a foot injury and is listed as questionable. Hopefully, he plays because the Bears need his leadership and pass rush ability tonight. With Aaron Rodgers being one of the most mobile quarterbacks in the league, getting a lot of a pass pressure on him and getting him down is a must.
Overall, surprisingly, the Bears aren’t as banged too terribly but the possibility of having Hicks out is concerning. Hopefully, he will be able to play.
Green Bay Packers
Davon House-CB-House will be out of the lineup with a quad injury tonight. House, the Packers starter at left corner, will be missed. This means that Quintin Rollins will likely have to step in and play tonight.
David Bakhtiari-OT– After a week of limited participation in practice, he is listed as doubtful with a hamstring injury going into the game tonight. Should he not be able to play, Adam Pankey will take his place.
Bryan Bulaga-OT-Bulaga, the tackle opposite Bakhtiari, is also listed as doubtful and will probably be out for Thursday’s game. Having both of their offensive tackles out tonight is not good for Green Bay. Hopefully, Chicago’s pass rush will be able to take advantage of this and get a lot of pass pressure on Rodgers. If Bulaga can’t play then the Packers will have to do some switching around to make things work.
Mike Daniels-DT-Daniels has a hip injury and has been limited in practice all week. It’s not known yet if he will play and if he can’t then Montravious Adams should take his place.
Nick Perry-LB-Perry enters the game as questionable but practiced in full after starting the week limited. It appears as if he is a go but if he can’t go then Kyler Fackrell will get the starting nod.
The Packers had five other players who started out the week limited in practice but ended it with no limitations. They were:
Safety Kentrell Rice with a groin injury.
Wide receiver Randall Cobb with a chest injury.
Running back Ty Montgomery with a wrist injury.
Linebacker Jake Ryan with a hamstring and a concussion issue.
Defensive tackle Quinton Dial with a chest injury.
Green Bay may have some critical pieces of their offensive line missing in this game so Chicago needs to take advantage of that. They need to rush Rodgers, contain him and not let him make plays with his feet. That will be easier with Bulaga and Bakhtiari out.
Hopefully, that will help even things up a little bit.
Score Prediction: Green Bay 21 Chicago 17

2017-18 Ashes: Aussies to watch,"(Before It's News)
The Ashes, arguably international cricket’s most vicious rivalry, rolls around once more in November. Although England emerged victorious (3-1) in the Australian series of 2010-11, the series of 2013-14 saw Australia enact vengeance in the most emphatic way possible – a 5-0 whitewash. Given the squad’s home ashes record, Australia would always be favourites against England. However, the home side have never been so widely backed to score a second consecutive home whitewash over England.
5-0 whitewash universally expected
To say that the two sides approach the series in contrasting mindsets would be an understatement, and this is reflected in current Ashes odds, which can be viewed by anyone who opts to click here . After losing 2-1 to South Africa last autumn, Australia have bounced back in very real terms, with perfect home test form prevalent after that disappointing showing against the Springboks. By contrast, England will travel to Australia in unusually low spirits, with Ben Stokes’ recent exclusion (on disciplinary grounds) from the visiting squad only serving to divide and disrupt.
England’s away form can only give the Australian squad even more encouragement, with the squad losing 4-1 to India in its last away test series. Some experts would assert that England’s only true hope is Joe Root, with most of the other expected first XI performing erratically of late. To the more ardent England fan, Alastair Cook is considered something of a talisman, but many believe that age is now catching up with him. Even at home, England have been susceptible to the occasional batting collapse, with the fourth test in the recent home series against the West Indies being a very damning case in hand.
Smith can be ‘captain fantastic’
As one of the chosen few to be an Ashes captain, Steve Smith will naturally be in the spotlight more than any other home player. Though his captaincy has seen mixed fortunes for Australia, if all forms of international cricket are taken into account, his personal statistics spell danger for England. As of June 2017, Smith had scored twelve centuries and averaged 73.27 per inning. Overcoming a humiliation at the hands of South Africa in 2016 was also a real test of character for Smith, with his captaincy then very much in the balance. 2017 has been a truer reflection of his abilities, and Smith also has a test win rate of exactly 50% as Australia’s captain.
NSW Trio to give England the ‘blues’
Much of the confidence in the home side stems from the range of efficient fast bowlers that Australia coach Darren Lehmann has at his disposal.
Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc are the most prominent men in that respect. With the latter two being left-handed, Australia will have the luxury of a multi-dimensional approach to dismissing England’s top batsmen. The fact that the trio are teammates at the NSW Blues can only add further fuel to the arguments in favour of an Australian whitewash.
David Warner: 30 not out
Though now the wrong side of thirty, top order batsman David Warner has the experience and composure needed to fulfil the expectation of a whitewash. Though part of a side that completed a 4-1 ODI series defeat to India just days ago, it was Warner’s never-say-die attitude which yielded the century that enabled the touring Aussies to win and avoid a whitewash. As one of the most hard-hitting Australian batsmen in recent memory, those who simply crave entertainment will certainly be keeping one eye on Warner.
Looking ahead
Lehmann’s uncompromising Australia squad has the impetus, but stranger things have happened in international cricket. The 2017-18 Ashes series begins at The Gabba on 23 November.

The accompanying music video was filmed during a live performance of the Dynamos in Los Angeles, CA. The video exhibits the band’s raw delivery and tremendous chemistry. Dynamos’ innate sense of enthusiasm and musicianship shines through this live performance and invites listeners to attend one of their live shows.
Introducing a contemporary blend of traditional and modern rock music, Dynamos burst into the scene earlier this year with their debut EP, Cold Comfort.

Dynamos is led by front woman and lead vocalist, Nadia E. She is accompanied by Nick Schaadt (music director, bass), Jacob Mayeda (lead guitar), Ian Nakazawa (drums), and Carlos Barrera (lead guitar). Nadia E. is known to rock the house with her soul-shaking voice and visual storytelling. Together, Dynamos combine technical expertise with pure raw energy to deliver a unique and captivating listening experience.

Video Shows Deadly Ride Malfunction At State Fair – WARNING: May Be Too Graphic For Some People,"COLUMBUS, Ohio – (AP) — The Ohio State Fair will open Thursday one day after a man was killed and seven other people were injured when a thrill ride broke apart, but the rides won’t be running until they all are deemed safe, officials state.
 
Video captured by a bystander at the fair Wednesday evening shows the Fire Ball ride swinging back and forth like a pendulum and spinning in the air when it crashes into something and part of the ride flies off. Screams are heard as passengers are thrown to the ground.
 
Officials said the man who was killed was one of several people who were thrown to the ground when the ride malfunctioned. They have not released his name. Ohio State Medical Center said three of the injured were being treated there. Two of them were in critical condition, the hospital said Thursday.

"Yankees Take Control Early, Then Suffer a Crushing Defeat","The winning rally began when Austin Jackson drew a walk from Dellin Betances to start the 13th and stole second. Gomes fouled off four two-strike pitches before hitting a hard bouncer just inside the third-base bag and just out of the reach of Torreyes. It easily scored Jackson and sent the Indians racing out of the third-base dugout to celebrate.
“It’s tough any way you cut it,” said Greg Bird, who gave the Yankees an 8-3 cushion in the fifth with a two-run home run. “We’ve got to bounce back, big time.”
The hit by Gomes was the final bit of an unraveling for the Yankees that began hours earlier when Manager Joe Girardi pulled C. C. Sabathia with one out in the sixth, even though the left-hander had recovered from a rocky start to retire 12 of 13 batters. His pitch count was only at 77.
Photo
But with Sabathia out of the game, the heavy toll of Tuesday’s wild-card win by the Yankees — in which the starter Luis Severino got only one out before the game was turned over to the bullpen — suddenly kicked in.
Green had been one of the Yankees’ most reliable relievers in the second half of the season, but he had to throw 41 pitches in helping to bail out Severino. And facing Lindor, with the bases loaded, he proceeded to give up his first home run since July 27, a blast that hit off the right-field foul pole and sent Lindor on a joyous trip around the bases.
“I feel like I take the blame tonight,” said Green, who gave up Lindor’s slam on his 23d pitch of the night. “I’ve got to do a better job getting out of that inning right there.”
Robertson, who threw a career-high 52 pitches on Tuesday, had not allowed a home run since July 29. But Bruce, whom the Yankees tried in vain to acquire from the Mets in August, continued to torment them for the second consecutive night, blasting a 3-1 pitch from Robertson deep into the left-center-field bleachers to tie the score at 8-8.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
“The last thing I wanted to do was walk him,” said Robertson, who allowed Bruce’s homer on his 22nd pitch of the night. “I wanted to make him hit the ball. I just didn’t expect him to hit an opposite-field home run right there.”

The Yankees had two good chances to regain the lead, but Cleveland’s side-arming right-hander, Joe Smith, froze Sanchez with a called third strike to end the ninth with Todd Frazier on third. Cody Allen retired Chase Headley on a groundout with runners at the corners to end the 10th inning.
The most crushing unfulfilled opportunity came in the 11th, when Torreyes — sent in to pinch-run for Frazier, who had reached second on a two-base error — was picked off by the rifle-armed Gomes, who threw from behind the plate on his knees.
“I was trying to be aggressive there, to make sure that I had a good lead “ Torreyes said. “I tried to get back as fast as I could, but I couldn’t make it. I was out.”
Photo
As much as the Yankees lamented that play, it was the hit-by-pitch call in the bottom of the sixth and the Yankees’ failure to appeal it that will be hard for the team to forget.
It came on Green’s third batter of the inning. After he replaced Sabathia with one out and a runner on first, he got a second out but then gave up a ringing double off the left-field wall to Gomes, putting runners on second and third.
Pinch-hitter Lonnie Chisenhall was then awarded first base when, after fouling off four straight two-strike pitches, he was hit on the hand by a pitch from Green. Or so the home plate umpire, Dan Iassogna, ruled. Sanchez immediately signaled to the Yankees’ dugout to check the replays, certain that the ball had hit Chisenhall’s bat. Since Sanchez caught the pitch anyway, Chisenhall would have been out on strikes, if the play had been ruled a foul ball.
Brett Weber, the coaching assistant who monitors replays for the Yankees, is regarded as one of the best in baseball, and during the three years the expanded replay system has been in effect, the Yankees have consistently had one of the best challenge rates in baseball.
Though super-slow-motion replays appeared to show the ball hitting the knob of Chisenhall’s bat, the Yankees chose not to have the play reviewed because, Girardi said, those replays were not available to Weber until after the 30-second review period had expired.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
By the time the Yankees learned that the ball had indeed hit Chisenhall’s bat, Lindor was at the plate, preparing to carve away almost all of the Yankees’ lead with one swing.
“Obviously that turned out to be a huge play, probably the biggest play of the game,” Headley said.
“You’d hope that that would be available,’’ he added of the replay videos. “It’s probably a lot easier for them to see.”
But in this instance, for the Yankees, it apparently wasn’t. And from there, the agony only intensified for them. By the time the game did end, after 5 hours 8 minutes, their season was on the brink of being over."
"Streep, Judi Dench slam Weinstein over sexual harassment claims","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Meryl Streep and Judi Dench, two of Hollywood’s most respected actresses, lashed out at movie producer Harvey Weinstein on Monday but said they were unaware of his decades of alleged sexual harassment of women.
As Hollywood moved to distance itself from Weinstein, Streep said she had been appalled by the claims made against the film studio executive she once likened to “God” in a 2012 awards speech.
His “behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,” Streep said a statement.
Britain’s Dench, who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1999 for the Weinstein-produced film “Shakespeare in Love,” said in a statement she was “completely unaware of these offences, which are of course horrifying.”
Stars like Streep and Dench, whose movies had been championed by Weinstein, have been under pressure to speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple women of unwanted physical contact by Weinstein over three decades.
Weinstein, 65, initially apologized but later threatened to sue over the allegations uncovered by the newspaper. He has not been charged with any crimes but was fired on Sunday as co-chairman of the Weinstein amid fallout from the Times story.

In a statement to the Huffington Post, Streep said she had been unaware of claims that Weinstein undressed in front of actresses and assistants and asked young women to give him massages.
“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed,” Streep said.

Producer and director Kevin Smith said on Monday he regretted taking money from Weinstein’s production company.
“He financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed,” Smith, known for the comedies “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back” and “Clerks,” wrote on Twitter.
Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan have said Weinstein sexually harassed them and movie director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison are among those have spoken out in support of them.
Weinstein is the latest U.S. media or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations. At Fox News, late Chief Executive Officer Roger Ailes was forced out in 2016 and anchor Bill O‘Reilly resigned in April after similar claims.

Passing Game Film Review - Good McCown - Week 3 (Dolphins),"Passing Game Film Review – Good McCown – Week 3 (Dolphins)
(Before It's News)
We’re back with another weekly breakdown of the passing game, and this one comes after a rare win for the Jets. Josh McCown looked much better, and the offensive system looks improved as well. Let’s see the good plays from this past game:
1)
This play is a good example of how play action, and a running game, helps the passing game. Notice the linebacker in the middle on the play, and how hard he bites on the play action. The corner back playing Anderson is taking outside leverage, which means he wants to filter Anderson towards the middle, and the line backer is tasked with taking the underneath route away, while the deep safety takes away the deep middle part of the field. The read on this play is simple, it’s the linebacker that bites on the play action. If the defender stays home, then it’s a longer developing play and you wait to see who the deep safety picks up, Anderson or Charone Peake from the slot. While Peake just got placed on injured reserve, you will see some of his route limitations here, because he telegraphs his route to the corner back. The defender is giving up inside leverage on this play, because that’s where he has help over the top with the safety, and linebackers designed to drop back. However, Peake gives away his route early because he turns inside, which allows the defender to turn his hips and move with him stride for stride. A better route would have been to attack the corner back vertically by going directly at him, which causes him to stay defensive since he can’t predict an inside or outside route, and then turning inside, which allows more time to create separation. In that scenario, you are even with the defender when he’s turning his hips, while you are still running vertically, which allows for natural separation. Overall, a very good route by Anderson and, good recognition and throw by McCown.
2)
The Dolphins employ an unusual blitz in this scenario, where they bring a slot corner and safety from the same spot, which more than likely is a mis-communication, especially considering the distance between the QB and the defenders. In most instances, on a corner or safety blitz, the defender nearby would pick up the receiver to avoid a quick throw. For example, if the slot corner is rightfully blitzing on this play, the safety assumes the role of the slot corner. In this instance, the defense is in complete disarray as they leave one person wide open, which happens to be Robby Anderson. If this play develops longer, the outside receiver Jermaine Kearse is going to run by the safety to be open down field, while Anderson will be open underneath him as well. The actual play doesn’t deal with any of them, because the primary read on this play is Austin-Seferian Jenkins. McCown is reading the middle linebacker on this play again, with crossing tight end routes. Whomever is picked up by the middle linebacker is eliminated, and the pass goes to the other tight end. McCown picks correctly and they get a sizable gain from this pass. It’s refreshing to see the Jets utilize the tight ends more in this offense because it gives the defense another dimension to worry about when planning their course of action.
3)
Staying with the middle linebacker reads, Josh McCown hits Kearse this time for a good chunk of yards. The read here is again the middle linebacker. If the linebacker sways towards Kearse, then Jenkins is cutting underneath for the open pass and room to run. If the linebacker stays in the middle, then Kearse is open for the easy pass, and McCown executes it well. As mentioned in the previous clip, the addition of frequent tight end routes limit the reaction time of linebackers because they have to account for tight ends running routes, unlike last year. Notice the route of Kerase here, and compare it to the route of Peake from the first clip. Kerase runs straight even though his defender is giving inside leverage, which causes the defender to pause, allowing for separation. There is a larger gap because the defender seems to be hesitant to follow Kearse to the middle, but it’s a good example of route running. He didn’t give away his route early, which limited the reaction time of the defender and helped him create separation. It’s a shame that Peake got hurt, because he could have learned a lot about route running from Kearse.
4)
This play doesn’t count since Kearse got called for a penalty, but it needs to be a staple in the play book because numerous teams take advantage of it, especially the Patriots. It’s essentially a pick play, similar to a setting a screen in basketball where one offensive player blocks the path of the defender playing another offensive player. It’s illegal to set a screen, but the rules are lax if you can make it seem like you are trying to run around, and just happened to be in the way of the defender. Ironically, Kearse was blamed heavily for not setting an effective screen on the infamous interception at the goal line in the Super Bowl. We also saw a similar play in the college football national championship game last year, where the University of Clemson won in the last minute. It’s a nice throw by McCown, and good catch but it’s all for naught. Kearse goes out of his way to set the pick, thus it can’t be interpreted as part of his route, and he rightfully gets called for the penalty. This play is here because the Jets need to utilize this play more often, and it’s a good sign that they are incorporating it into their offensive plan.
5)
ArDarius Stewart makes his presence known in this game with this wonderful catch. This is another feather in the cap for the offensive game plan, and comes on a 3rd and 13. The Jets are known to be conservative and this play is a big reason why they should take more chances down the field. First of all, look away from Stewart to the other side of the formation. The Jets have three receivers to the left side of the formation, but the defense has five defenders dedicated to the area. The Dolphins are in zone coverage, but it’s the deep route from the slot (looks like Kerley, hard to tell) that helps this play. The deep route keeps the single high safety planted in the middle. The second aspect of this pass is the running back out of the backfield, because he’s the one that occupies the underneath defender towards Stewart’s side. If the defender stays with Stewart, then throw to the running back in the open and hope he can make a guy miss in the open field. If the defender bites on the running back, a passing lane opens up for Stewart, and the opportunity for a first down. Josh McCown makes a great read on this play, but a mediocre throw. The ball is a bit ahead of Stewart, who make a diving catch to save the drive. Also notice the reactions of the defender because Stewart is running a straight route, as the defender can’t make up his mind if it’s an inside or out route. This hesitation causes the defender to slow down and speed up a couple of times during this route, and Stewart catches him at a critical point in the transition, which allows him more space when breaking down. It’s not an ideal route but better than the routes run by Peake, and shows a better knowledge of setting up defenders while in route.
6)
There are offensive systems that focus on individual match-ups and then there are systems that help the QB make quick reads at various levels of the field. Most systems intermingle between the two to keep defenses honest. Therefore, on certain plays, it’s up to the receivers to win their match ups to be open on the play, while in certain situations, it depends on spacing. This one would fall under the latter. The play is designed to give McCown options while on the run, and it works perfectly here and you can see it unfold. While it’s a simple play, the set up on this is very complex. First of all, the play action leaning towards the left side of the formation, the biggest intent of this is to freeze the linebackers on the right side of the formation instead of driving backwards. The lack of movement from the defenders robs them of momentum, while the offensive players are running full speed, therefore it creates drastic differences in velocity between the offensive and defensive player. All the players involved in the play are then running towards the right side of the formation at varying times, which creates different levels for the QB to pick. If the linebackers drop too far, then there is the quick route to Jenkins available as the safe option. If the linebackers come up, there is Charone Peake cutting across the field at the intermediate option. If the linebackers slow down a bit, Kerley has the angle to the sideline. If the deep safety sees Peake open and goes towards him, there is an offensive player running deep behind him for a TD. The options vary and the defense picks it’s poison, rather than the offensive players winning individual battles. Josh McCown probably picked the second best option, as Peake seemed to be the safer throw with opportunity to run down the field. The pass to Kerley is a bit towards the sideline, and the receiver makes a good catch as he goes out of bounds.
7)
This play occurs on 3rd and 22, and even the best offensive systems can’t draw up plays that are consistently successful in these situations. It’s actually a bad route by Kearse as he gives away his route and sticks to the inside defender, instead of gaining more separation first. The Dolphins decide to put the pressure on the Jets by having just a single high safety and leaving the middle of the field open for the pre-snap read. If Kearse does a better job of creating separation from the inside defender, he would have had an opportunity to run for yards after the catch. Nevertheless, this is a great throw by McCown, who puts it exactly where Kerase could catch the ball and gain 18 yards. It’s not enough for a first down, but made the field goal attempt much easier.
8)
It’s likely you missed this touchdown live, because most two minute drills for the team involve kneel downs and check downs. The Jets decided to take some shots this time, and got rewarded with a touchdown. The breakdown on this play is fairly simple, read the deep safety who has two deep routes coming towards him from opposite sides of the field. Pick the side that appears to be safer. McCown does a good job of picking the right side, and then making a great throw. This is probably one of the best throws of McCown’s short stay with the Jets. Notice the route by Anderson, and the slight movement to the outside when he gets off the line. This small movement creates just a tad more separation with the defender because he has to take half a step to make sure Anderson is going to the inside. Afterwards, the receiver just turns on the afterburners and runs by the defender. Jenkins does his best Warriors impression by celebrating even before the catch is made.
9)
Remember the play from earlier about tiers on a roll out? The Jets try this again, and the Dolphins are better prepared for it. The offense tries the same play fake to one side, roll out to the other with receivers running in tiers, but it’s defended better on this play. What makes the play for the Dolphins is the middle linebacker turning around to locate Robby Anderson and close the gap as soon as possible, limiting the choices for McCown. He does well to take the safe option to Jenkins, although if he had more time, there is an option open down the field for a come back route. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough time for that route to develop. This is one of the advantages of having tiered routes because it allows for built in hot reads (Jenkins), intermediate reads, and deep reads, depending on how much penetration is allowed by the offensive line.
10)
Almost a TD on this simple play. Why is it here? This is a 3rd and 1 play with the Jets looking like they are going to run. Instead, they decide to pass, and almost get a TD out of the play. Remember the failed play by Kearse, where he got called for interference? Well guess who is back running a pick play in a crucial moment and succeeding. Kerase does a better job of hiding his intentions here, and even tries to get out of the way once the defender has slowed down. The whole point of the pick play here is to allow a clean catch, and just enough yards to get the first down. Since it’s a short yardage situation, most likely the defense is in a run stopping package, which means any outside passes will be defended one on one. Therefore, by running the pick, Kearse is impeding the momentum of the defender and ensuring a clean opportunity for a catch. There is also a nice block down the field that helps springs Lawrence Thomas down the field. Thomas was a former running back at Michigan State University, who converted to the defensive line in college, so it’s definitely a surprise to see him run down the field.
11)
This is simply just a good throw by McCown where he put it in a place where only Kearse could catch the pass. It looks like there is sufficient evidence to call pass interference against either player, and Kearse does a good job of separating himself and catching the pass.
12)
Back to reading middle linebackers for Josh McCown. This is a 3rd and 6 play and the Dolphins are confused once again, and leave multiple players open. The read here is the middle linebacker for the QB. If the linebacker runs towards Kerley, then Jenkins is open for the pass in the middle. If the defender stays in the middle, Kerley is open on the slant route, which is what McCown chooses. The third read seems to be Charone Peake, who is also wide open on the play. McCown makes a good choice to get the first down and the drive continues.
Conclusion:
The Jets looked much better on offense in this game, than in the past two games. The offensive system seems to be generating more success, and the team isn’t as passive. Josh McCown took some shots down the field and got rewarded, which opened up the field for the Jets. The Dolphins did not have a good game plan for the Jets in this game, and their secondary play was suspect at best. Please check in tomorrow for out “McFrown” article to see the bad plays.

Trump’s Argument Against Immigrants: We’ve Heard It Before,"But Californians, like many other Americans, chafed at border controls they deemed too lax. The referendum passed by a margin of nearly 3 to 2. Legal challenges stopped it in its tracks, though. A mortal blow was delivered when a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled in 1997 that the proposition was an unconstitutional “legislative scheme to regulate immigration,” a sphere that judge said was solely the domain of the federal government.
But even if it never took effect, Proposition 187 cast a long shadow. Similar measures enjoyed support in other states that were magnets for immigrants, including Arizona, Florida, New York and Texas. Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican who made the initiative a centerpiece of his 1994 re-election campaign, described it as “the two-by-four we need” to get Washington to pay heed to the flow of undocumented newcomers into the country.

Washington did pay attention. In the mid-1990s, with Republicans in control of Congress and President Clinton tacking more to the right, tougher immigration policies took shape. Fences were built and patrols stepped up. Deportations rose. “They were scared to death of what Prop 187 symbolized,” Roberto Suro, a professor of public policy and journalism at the University of Southern California and former New York Times journalist, told Retro Report. The greater aggressiveness of the 1990s, he said, created “the basis for the large-scale removals that we’ve experienced in this country for the last 10 years.” Those removals reached a peak under President Barack Obama, described disapprovingly by some critics as the deporter-in-chief.
Now here is Mr. Trump, who built his presidential run on a promise to build a border wall, and who began his campaign by attacking Mexico as supposedly an exporter of rapists and other criminals. As in 1994 California, the anger is directed powerfully at those arriving without documentation. Last month, though suggesting he was open to compromise, the president announced he would end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that protected immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children.
The Trump assault, however, extends to all forms of immigration. In August, he embraced proposals to cut lawful entries in half over the next decade. Preference would be given to people possessing special skills and higher education — hardly the tired, the poor and the wretched refuse embraced in “The New Colossus,” the Emma Lazarus poem affixed to Miss Liberty’s base.
Two weeks ago, Trump administration officials disclosed their intention to cap refugee admissions at 45,000 over the next year. That would be the lowest ceiling, by far, since a 1980 law gave the president authority to help set limits on those searching for a haven from persecution in their own countries.
Surveys show that Mr. Trump’s “America first” sloganeering helped him eke out victories in November in critical swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where some longer-term residents are uncomfortable with rising numbers of Latino newcomers. Sudden diversity is rarely simple. For some, it is scary.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But California in the wake of Proposition 187 may point to where the country as a whole is headed. The most populous state has undergone a profound demographic shift since the mid-1990s. Latinos now have a plurality; they and Asian-Americans combined are the majority. Non-Hispanic whites account for less than 40 percent.
As the video shows, Latinos in California are registering to vote in ever larger numbers, though whites are still more likely to go to the polls. The Latino representation in the legislature grows as well, to include prominent figures like State Senator Kevin de León. He said that many Californians, and not just Latinos, have had “enough with the scapegoating” of certain ethnic groups whenever the state has economic or other troubles.
Now California is cerulean blue politically, and there lies a cautionary tale for Republicans. With demographics changing almost everywhere, they may yet find that the short-term gain of the Trump 2016 victory comes at their long-term expense.
Still, dispelling xenophobia is no easy matter: “Immigration is one of those touchy issues for Americans that can suddenly turn ugly and flower into a major national argument.” That was from Charles Wheeler, speaking in 1994 as executive director of the National Center on Immigrant Rights. What he said then remains true today."
GOTW: Preston v Sunderland,"GOTW: Preston v Sunderland
(Before It's News)
Well that was an action packed week – more than the usual amount of video content in this post as there was a lot to cover!
Last week’s game of the week lived up to expectations:
But then Leeds imploded on Tuesday evening – they were 2-0 down at Cardiff City before Liam Cooper was sent off. You’ve got to wonder if that was a game too far for the Yorkshire club.
Cardiff’s victory means that they’re two points clear of Sheffield United going into this weekend’s games, although both Leeds and Wolves could overtake the Bluebirds if Cardiff lose at home to Derby.
At the wrong end of the table, Bolton are now four points adrift of Sunderland, who are two points behind three clubs on eight points. As I mentioned last week, Bolton are currently worse than Rotherham were last season and are now as short as 1/4 for relegation.
Preston v Sunderland
Just over 80 years ago, the clubs met in the FA Cup Final:
Tomorrow’s game is under slightly different circumstances: Preston are currently fifth in the table and their transformation under former Norwich City boss Alex Neil is one of the stories that hasn’t been given credit so far. The Lillywhites have lost once this season and have only lost once at Deepdale since Boxing Day 2016. Add four clean sheets in five home games this season into the mix and it’s clear that Preston are currently in the top six on merit.
Sunderland – with former Preston boss Simon Grayson at the helm – have been awful so far. They’ve not won since the middle of last month and haven’t managed a victory in a league game at the Stadium of Light since beating Watford in the Premier League just before last Christmas. The main problem is defence: almost half of the 19 goals they’ve conceded so far this season have been scored in either the first or the last fifteen minutes of the game and they’ve already blown leads at Hull City and Sheffield Wednesday. Grayson’s already used 23 different players in league games with George Honeyman and James Vaughan as the only ever presents, which highlights another issue: Honeyman was promoted from the under 23 side and last season Vaughan was playing in League One for Bury. If the Black Cats continue their poor run, it’s not exactly difficult to see what the problem is.
Head to head: first meeting at Deepdale in a league game since October 2006, which Preston won 4-1. The Lillywhites have won half of the last ten league games between the clubs in Lancashire, Sunderland’s last win at Preston came in August 2003. Both teams have scored in eight of the last ten meetings with an average of 3.4 goals per game: considering how bad Sunderland’s defence is at the moment, that might be worth a punt!
The other game to monitor is at the Pirelli Stadium in Burton, where Wolves are the visitors. The 2-0 loss at Sheffield United on Tuesday was Wolves’ first defeat in five games but they’re still only three points behind Cardiff. After a poor start Burton seemed to have turned the corner recently, but a comprehensive 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa (who finally seem to have got the hang of this) earlier this week underlined The Brewers’ defensive fragility.
Televised games: QPR v Fulham (Friday, Sky Sports Football, 7:45pm kick off) is the usual lazy planning, Reading v Norwich (Saturday, Sky Sports Football 5:30pm kick off) would have looked good on paper before the season started but if Sheffield Wednesday v Leeds (Sunday, Sky Sports Main Event, 12:15pm kick off) is as entertaining as last week’s Steel City Derby was then we’re in for a treat…
No scheduled post next weekend, so all being well I’ll be back in a fortnight with a general look at the first quarter of the season.

(Before It's News)
As the Chicago Cubs are on the verge of clinching the NL Central division title for the second-straight year, there are still some concerns. Right now there’s no clear choice as to who will start Game 1 of a playoff series against the Washington Nationals as it still seems to be a big debate. Jon Lester has been both good and bad in his last two starts and is one of the candidates. The other? Jake Arrieta, but there’s a small problem. Arrieta didn’t look himself against the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday night. He gave up three earned runs in just three innings pitched, including two home runs. The Cubs fell behind early and although they made it interesting late, they were denied the chance to clinch at Busch Stadium Tuesday. Following the game, Arrieta revealed that he wasn’t 100 percent which should be of some concern to Cubs fans: https://twitter.com/MDGonzales/status/912900720646598656 Arrieta suffered a hamstring injury in early September after he exited a game early against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He hasn’t been right since, which causes some concern on him being a Game 1 starter. He told Cubs.com that he will have to make some adjustments moving forward:
“I’ve had to adjust a couple things in my delivery,” Arrieta said. “It’s still there a little bit, but I’m fine. I’m plenty healthy enough to go out there and compete and pitch at a high level.”
The Cubs have another chance to clinch on Wednesday night, needing just a win or a Milwaukee Brewers loss. It’s likely going to happen and a showdown with the Nationals is in-store. But the question still looms as to who the Game 1 starter will be, and it’s an important one.

"Waiver Worthy: RB Edition: Latavius Murray, Wayne Gallman Among Must Add Options","Waiver Worthy: RB Edition: Latavius Murray, Wayne Gallman Among Must Add Options
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Week 4 created numerous opportunities for running backs who could quickly emerge as must use fantasy options on a weekly basis. There were some significant injuries (Chris Carson, Dalvin Cook), while others continued to underperform. Let’s take a look at the running backs you are going to want to target off the wire, and which ones you may want to ignore:
Wayne Gallman – New York Giants – Running Back
Paul Perkins has been a bitter disappointment over the first few weeks, with 32 carries for 61 yards (1.9 yards per carry) and 0 TD. You could argue that the Giants need to look elsewhere, even if Perkins hadn’t gone down with a rib injury. Instead that just expedited the process, and Gallman stepped in and showed more upside immediately:
Rushing – 11 carries for 42 yards
Receiving – 2 receptions for 8 yards and 1 TD
A fourth round draft pick, Walter Football compared him to former Giant starter Rashad Jennings prior to the draft. It’s an interesting comparison, as he had some solid seasons in New York and shows that Gallman has the potential to run with the role.
Verdict – Must add in all formats
Latavius Murray – Minnesota Vikings – Running Back
The Vikings lost their dynamic rookie runner, Dalvin Cook, and are now left to try and pick up the pieces. Murray has shown ample potential as a starter in the past, his biggest problem has been more based on injuries than anything (and talk is he’s currently not 100%). In 14 games last season with Oakland Murray averaged 4.0 yards per carry after eclipsing 1,000 yards in 2015. The biggest upside is in the TD department, having scored 12 TD last season, and he’s also shown an ability to catch passes.
There are other options for the Vikings, including Bishop Sankey and Jerrick McKinnon, so Murray will likely share the snaps (though he should dominate the early down work). He may not have elite upside, but we know what he is and the potential for him to contribute. Consider him a must own.
Verdict – Must add in all formats
Andre Ellington – Arizona Cardinals – Running Back
The Cardinals have appeared committed to Chris Johnson over the past few weeks, though it’s obvious that he’s not the running back with the highest potential. Just look at the Week 4 production:
Chris Johnson – 13 carries for 32 yards
Andre Ellington – 5 carries for 18 yards
Obviously Ellington’s 3.6 YPC isn’t going to blow you away, though he was targeted 14 times (team leader) and turned it into 9 receptions for 86 yards. Ellington is never going to be the lead runner, as Arizona looks to limit his touches and keep him healthy, and you also can’t bank on this many targets on a weekly basis. He’s ownable, especially in PPR formats, but he’s not going to be among the top waiver targets.
Verdict – Must add in PPR formats; worth stashing in standard leagues with 14+ teams
Elijah McGuire – New York Jets – Running Back
He exploded for 93 yards and 1 TD on 10 carries in Week 4, and now has taken 23 carries for 156 yards and 1 TD in his rookie season (6.8 yards/carry). He wasn’t the only Jets’ running back who stepped up in the absence of Matt Forte, as Bilal Powell took 21 carries for 163 yards and 1 TD. The question is if McGuire will take on a bigger workload, and if Matt Forte is going to eat into both players touches.
Time will tell how the situation plays out, but for as long as Forte is out (and look for the Jets to be “cautious”) expect Powell to lead the pack with McGuire syphoning off 10-12 touches per week. That brings potential FLEX appeal, and if Powell were to get hurt McGuire would have the opportunity to step in and thrive.
Verdict – Worth adding as depth option, if you have the roster spot
Alex Collins – Baltimore Ravens
The Baltimore offense is in shambles, but Collins was an obvious bright spot in Week 4 as he was by far the best runner:
Alex Collins – 9 carries for 82 yards
Javorius Allen – 2 carries for 7 yards
Terrance West – 4 carries for -7 yards
Allen is going to remain the primary pass catcher, but Collins should get an opportunity to operate as the early down runner moving forward (as long as he can hold onto the football, with fumble issues quickly cropping up). That makes him worth the add as a depth option, but we’ll have to wait and see before plugging him into your lineup.
Verdict – Must add in leagues of 14+ teams
Green Bay Running Backs
The word now is that Ty Montgomery isn’t injured as badly as originally thought, and we know when healthy he’s going to be the lead back. Aaron Jones is the top healthy back is worth adding, while Jamaal Williams is also worth stashing, but neither offer long-term appeal at this point.
Verdict – Jones may be a short-term play, but nothing more
Higher Ownership Options
Alvin Kamara – New Orleans Saints – He exploded for 10 catches, 71 yards and 1 TD, while adding 5 carries for 25 yards. He’s clearly one of the two main parts of the committee, with Adrian Peterson (4 carries for 4 yards) falling out of the mix. Kamara doesn’t offer lead back upside (if Mark Ingram were to get hurt, Peterson will likely assume the opportunities), but in PPR formats he’s a must add.
Thomas Rawls – Seattle Seahawks – He was a healthy scratch in Week 4, but with Chris Carson getting injured Rawls is going to jump back into a prominent role. Of course Eddie Lacy is going to have something to say about that, though Rawls is the preferred addition.
Eddie Lacy – Seattle Seahawks – He was the backup to Carson in Week 4 and turned 11 carries into 52 yards. He’s also hard to trust, and is going to be part of a three or four man timeshare (C.J. Prosise and J.D. McKissic). The Seattle situation remains one that’s best left ignored.

Rohingya Recount Atrocities: ‘They Threw My Baby Into a Fire’,"Much of the violence was flamboyantly brutal, intimate and personal — the kind that is detonated by a long, bitter history of ethnic hatred.
“People were holding the soldiers’ feet, begging for their lives,” Rajuma said. “But they didn’t stop, they just kicked them off and killed them. They chopped people, they shot people, they raped us, they left us senseless.”
Human rights investigators said that Myanmar’s military killed more than 1,000 civilians in the state of Rakhine, and possibly as many as 5,000, though it will be hard to ever know because Myanmar is not allowing the United Nations or anyone else into the affected areas.
Peter Bouckaert, a veteran investigator with Human Rights Watch, said there was growing evidence of organized massacres, like the one Rajuma survived, in which government soldiers methodically slaughtered more than 100 civilians in a single location. He called them crimes against humanity.
On Wednesday, the United Nations human rights office said that government troops had targeted “houses, fields, food-stocks, crops, livestock and even trees,” making it “almost impossible” for the Rohingya to return home.
Myanmar’s army has claimed it was responding to an attack by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25 and targeting only the insurgents. But according to dozens of witnesses, almost all of the people killed were unarmed villagers, and many had their hands bound.
Satellite imagery has revealed 288 separate villages burned, some down to the last post.
Human rights groups said the government troops had one goal: to erase entire Rohingya communities. The unsparing destruction drove more than half a million people into Bangladesh in recent weeks. United Nations officials called the campaign against the Rohingya a “textbook example” of ethnic cleansing.
Nearly each night here in coastal Bangladesh, up the Bay of Bengal from Myanmar, bodies wash up in the foamy brown tide — children, men, old women who tried to escape on leaking boats, their faces bloated from seawater.
Rajuma barely made it to Bangladesh, escaping on a small wooden boat a few weeks ago. She cannot read or write. She does not have a single piece of paper to prove who she is or that she was born in Myanmar. This may be a problem if she applies for refugee status in Bangladesh, which has been reluctant to give it, or ever tries to go home to Myanmar. She thinks she is around 20, but she could pass for 14 — painfully thin, with wrists that look as if they could easily break.
She grew up in a rice farming hamlet called Tula Toli, and said the place had never known peace."
Brandon Saad is the spark the Chicago Blackhawks need,"Brandon Saad is the spark the Chicago Blackhawks need
(Before It's News)
After two long years with the Columbus Blue Jackets and John Tortorella, Brandon Saad is back at home with the Chicago Blackhawks. While Artemi Panarin had great chemistry with Patrick Kane, Saad is arguably more valuable to the Blackhawks. When Saad was traded away, Blackhawks fans and other hockey circles were quick to point out that he wouldn’t be as good with Columbus because he spent most of his time with Toews and Hossa on the first line. Saad answered his critics with two straight 53 point seasons, even surviving Tortorella’s nonsensical coaching methods. Tortorella would bench Saad or relegate him to the fourth line at times, Quenneville’s dog house isn’t even that bad! Saad is the complete hockey player package; skates hard and fast, defensively reliable, finishing scoring touch and hard to knock off the puck. With those tools, The Blackhawks needed to have Saad back in the fold to reignite Toews and anchor down the first line. With Hossa out of the lineup this year Saad is one of the few players that can fill that gap. I’m totally aware that Hossa can’t just be “replaced” Saad can still provide that same stability and presence. The Saad – Toews – Panik line can be a force to be reckoned with this season. Brandon Saad on Marian Hossa’s Influence:
” That guy [Hossa] means a lot to a lot of people. For me to come in as a young guy especially, he’s a guy I’ve looked up to. I think he plays the game the way I want to play the game.”
Stan Bowman ultimately brought Saad back because he’s cost controlled at $6 million a year over 4 years and only 24 years old. There was absolutely no way the Blackhawks could afford Panarin’s contract after 2 years when his asking price will likely be over $7 million. If the past two years and this year’s preseason is any indication, Saad is ready to have the best season of his career back at home with the Blackhawks and once again fans can KNEEL BEFORE SAAD.

"Boy Scouts of America to allow girls to join, earn Eagle Scout rank","(Reuters) - In a historic shift, the Boy Scouts of America will let girls enroll in Cub Scouts starting next year and allow them to eventually earn the highest rank of Eagle Scout, the organization said on Wednesday.
The unanimous decision by the 100-year-old group’s board of directors came after years of requests from families and girls, it said, though the announcement prompted a largely negative reaction on social media.
“We believe it is critical to evolve how our programs meet the needs of families interested in positive and lifelong experiences for their children,” Boy Scouts Chief Executive Michael Surbaugh said in a statement.
The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) has lost about a third of its members since 2000, which now stands at 2.3 million. BSA insisted that allowing girls was in response to the needs of families, not related to declining membership.
The Girl Scouts of the USA said girls thrive in a girl-only environment, and that “we are girl experts.”
Starting in 2018, the Boy Scouts will allow girls to join the 7- to 10-year-old Cub Scouts. Small, community-level “dens” will be single-gender. Larger “packs,” which are comprised of dens, will decide whether to include dens of each gender or not, the BSA said.
In a program to be announced next year and projected to start in 2019, girls will follow the same curriculum as the Boy Scouts, which are for ages 11-17.
Surbaugh in a tweet said, “Today, the BSA opens a new chapter in our history w/a unanimous vote to welcome girls to Cub through Eagle Rank.”
An Eagle Scout patch is pictured in Orlando, Florida in this May 30, 2012 file photograph. REUTERS/David Manning/Files
After the announcement, the Girl Scouts issued a statement that did not mention the Boy Scouts or its move to include girls.
“Girl Scouts remains committed to and believes strongly in the importance of the all-girl, girl-led and girl-friendly environment that Girl Scouts provides, which creates a necessary safe space for girls to learn and thrive,” the organization said.
FILE PHOTO - A boy scout statue titled ""Trail to Manhood"" stands outside the National Scouting Museum in Irving, Texas, U.S. on May 22, 2013. REUTERS/Michael Prengler/File Photo
In August, a top Girl Scout official accused the Boy Scouts of running a “covert campaign” to recruit girls to increase its declining membership, the Washington Post reported.
The program for girls older than Cub Scouts projected to begin in 2019 will allow them to earn the Eagle Scout rank, the highest achievement in the organization.
On social media, hundreds of people were critical of the news, with many posts echoing the sentiments of Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son.
“Strange, I thought that’s what the Girl Scouts was for???” he said on Twitter.
Sing Oldham, spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention, said the announcement continued a “reinvention” of the Boy Scouts his group does not support, including the decision in 2013 to allow openly gay members.
In January, the Boy Scouts also opted to allow transgender boys to join."

By Rich Mitchell
In an ongoing public relations tidal wave on tax reform, the House Republicans released a video that tries to answer the question “why does tax reform matter to you?”
More time with family, higher take-home pay, more good-paying jobs and advantages for small business owners are just some of the points the video kinda makes.
The short presentation follows a set of appearances, tweets, facebook posts and statements made by Paul Ryan and House members pushing tax reform. But, educating Americans isn’t going to pass the bill – or even get it out of committee. It’s popular, Americans want it so quit selling and close the deal.
Whether or not real tax reform, with easier filing, less complexity, and lower taxation, is up to Congress. And the people will call, email, fax, and write their members until this is passed.
Failure to pass reform will continue the growing wave of anti-incumbent, anti-Washington sentiment that will impact both Republicans and Democrats.
Oh yeah… here’s that barely informative video they released:

Growing Chorus Confronts Trump Against Leaving Nuclear Deal,"The White House’s overarching Iran policy is predicated on de-emphasizing the nuclear deal in favor of confronting Tehran on other issues, including its missile program and its support for extremist groups throughout the Middle East. Yet Mr. Trump’s longstanding contempt for the nuclear accord — he has labeled it a “disaster” and the “worst deal ever” — has kept it center stage.
Lawmakers in the House and Senate remained largely in the dark on Wednesday as to Mr. Trump’s precise plans, even as congressional leaders prepared for the likelihood that the deal’s fate would end up in their laps by week’s end. Other lawmakers, including some Republicans once critical of the deal, called on Mr. Trump to preserve it himself.

All were operating under the assumption that Mr. Trump is preparing to withhold certification. In so doing, he would make it easier for Congress to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s nuclear program and effectively kill the deal with simple majorities in both chambers.
But senior Republican congressional aides said that outcome appeared unlikely, even if much of their party — and many Democrats — remained critical of the deal. Without explicit evidence of a breach by the Iranians, and given Europe’s support for the deal, there appeared to be little appetite among Republican leaders to pull the plug on Mr. Trump’s behalf.
“As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it,” Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Wednesday. He urged Mr. Trump to provide Congress with clear instructions for what he was trying to do.
“Whatever he decides, it is critical that the president lay out the facts,” Mr. Royce said. “He should explain what his decision means, and what it doesn’t.”
Mr. Royce and others in the House have argued instead for stepped-up enforcement and the enforcement of additional, targeted sanctions against Iran’s missile program and Hezbollah. Lawmakers were also preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump could simply ask them to amend the law that requires him to recertify the deal every 90 days.

Any legislative outcome is likely to hinge on the Senate, where Democrats are confident they can hold most of their members together to preserve the deal. Of the four Senate Democrats who voted against the deal, two — Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee — have indicated they would not move to abandon it.

That leaves two other previous Democratic no votes, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, undecided. But Republicans could also lose some of their own, like Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine or Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Looming over all this is the prerogative of Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee who has been bitterly feuding with Mr. Trump. Mr. Corker’s sway over the committee, and the Republican caucus, could prove consequential in advancing legislation.

Some people expressed concern that Mr. Corker could no longer play the role of broker between the White House and Congress — a role that is not easily replaced. The Senate’s other leading Iran expert, Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, is viewed as too hard-line to be an intermediary.
As the White House prepared to roll out the policy, experts were focusing on two unanswered questions: how it would confront Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group, and whether it would designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. Such a designation would be significant because the guard corps is the military wing of the Iranian government.
John Kerry, the former secretary of state who negotiated the Iran deal, warned House Democrats that such a move would set a dangerous precedent, according to a person who attended the briefing. Additionally, Ernest Moniz, the former energy secretary who was deeply involved in the negotiations, briefed House Democrats on Wednesday afternoon.
There were other concerns. Democrats argued that whatever the intention of Mr. Trump’s maneuvering, it would be lost on America’s negotiating partners abroad.
Representative Eliot L. Engel, top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, who was previously critical of the deal, said that decertifying the agreement amounted to “playing with fire.”
Jake Sullivan, who helped negotiate the deal for the Obama administration, said, “This dance around decertification has not been productive for our broader goals. It’s much harder to push our European partners to pressure Iran on missiles and terrorism when they are more focused on the risk Washington poses than they are on the risk Tehran poses.”
But critics of the deal said Mr. Trump’s willingness to walk away from it would give the United States the leverage to improve its terms — first with the Europeans, and later with Iran.

“Decertification reinforces the credibility of Donald Trump’s walkaway, which is terrifying European political leaders that he actually could leave the nuclear deal,” said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a leading critic of the nuclear accord. “This is already shifting the European positions from ‘keep it’ to ‘keep it, but fix it.’”"
North Korean Leader Hails Nuclear Arsenal as ‘Powerful Deterrent’,"Photo
SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has vowed to build up his country’s nuclear arsenal as a “powerful deterrent” to the United States, state media reported, hours after President Trump said that “only one thing will work” in dealing with the isolated country.
Mr. Kim made his comments on Saturday at a meeting of the Central Committee of his ruling Workers’ Party, the official Korean Central News Agency reported on Sunday. He also reconfirmed his policy of simultaneously seeking progress in his nuclear weapons program and pushing for economic growth in the face of expanding international sanctions.
The remarks indicated that Mr. Kim had no intention of retreating under American pressure even as South Korean officials and analysts worry that the North will conduct a major weapons test to observe the anniversary on Tuesday of the founding of the Workers’ Party.
North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a “powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying, citing “protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.”

Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Saturday that 25 years of talks and deals with North Korea had come to nothing, making “fools of U.S. negotiators.” He added, “Sorry, but only one thing will work!”"
Spanish stocks rebound in flat European market as Catalonia fears ease,"MILAN (Reuters) - Spanish shares rebounded sharply in a flat European market on Wednesday on hopes that a big political crisis in the euro zone’s fourth largest economy could de-escalate after Catalonia stopped short of declaring formal independence from Madrid.
While Spain's benchmark IBEX .IBEX rose 1.3 percent, the pan-European STOXX 600 index ended flat and the euro zone blue chip index .STOXX50E inched up 0.2 percent.
Spanish stocks have lagged their European peers this month with an 0.9 percent fall on worries of a possible break-up of the country following Catalonia’s independence referendum on Oct. 1 that Madrid had deemed unconstitutional.
Concerns however eased after the region’s separatist leader made only a symbolic declaration, triggering a response from the Spanish prime minister that could deepen the confrontation but also signals a possible way out of the crisis.
European equities have broadly brushed off the Spanish tensions while the fall on the IBEX remains limited. The Madrid index is still up more than 10 percent so far this year.
“For the wider European economy and probably even the wider Spanish economy I don’t see huge risk at the moment and you see that in the muted market reaction,” said Marcus Morris-Eyton, European equities portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors.
Marcus Morris-Eyton’s two Spanish holdings are Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC) and information technology supplier Amadeus (AMA.MC), two global companies which he said have little domestic Spanish exposure and are unlikely to be much affected by political developments.
Inditex added 1.3 percent and Amadeus rose 0.8 percent.
Banks Sabadell (SABE.MC) and Caixabank (CABK.MC), which have moved their legal bases from Catalonia to other parts of Spain, rose 1.2 percent and 0.3 percent respectively after being severely hit this week by worries over the Crisis.
FILE PHOTO: Traders look at computer screens at Madrid's bourse, Spain, June 29, 2015. REUTERS/Susana Vera
Sabadell and Caixa have the biggest exposure among top Spanish banks to private sector loans in Catalonia region, while Santander (SAN.MC), and Unicaja (UNI.MC), both up 0.6 percent, have the lowest.
Elsewhere Italian banking stocks .FTIT8300 rose 1.4 percent traders citing relief that new proposals by the EU Commission to strengthen the banking sector made no reference to stricter provisioning rules on the existing backlog of bad loans.
Top gainers were Banco BPM (BAMI.MI), UBI Banca (UBI.MI), which rose 4.8 and 3.9 percent respectively.
Italian banks have been hit by a sell-off over the past week after the ECB Bank unveiled plans to require lenders to set aside more money on new soured debts. This has angered Italy, which fears this treatment could be extended to the current stock of non performing loans.
GEA Group (G1AG.DE) was the biggest gainer on the STOXX, up 5.8 percent, after hedge fund Elliott revealed a stake in the in German food-processing machinery firm.
Some early results were also in focus, with shares in Mondi (MNDI.L) dropping 7.8 percent after the paper and packaging manufacturer cut its full-year guidance.
Estimates however point to European third-quarter earnings growing 5.3 percent from the same period last year, which would be an increase of 2.3 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.
Morris-Eyton said he was upbeat on earnings prospects for European companies, even though the effects of this summer’s rapid surge in the euro needed to be monitored.
“We are generally pretty positive on European earnings and that’s one of our major bull cased for Europe,” he said."
Ivanka Trump makes the child tax credit push,"Story highlights Ivanka Trump is working on tax reform
She's advocating for a child tax credit expansion
(CNN) Ivanka Trump is moving her work on expanding the child tax credit forward, meeting with bipartisan lawmakers and advocacy groups and organizations in recent weeks.
The senior adviser to the President is ramping up her push as the White House works to build support in Congress for tax reform. President Donald Trump will make a speech on the topic in an airport rally-style event near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Wednesday evening.
""Ivanka wants to see an expansion of the child tax credit as it is an essential part of ensuring a middle class tax cut. She is meeting with members of Congress and advocacy groups to discuss possible proposals,"" said a White House official, adding, ""As with other areas of tax reform, the administration has laid out its vision and is now working with the relevant committees who are preparing key specifics.""
Traveling across the country on the campaign trail, Ivanka Trump made pro-family policies a hallmark of her appearances.
""As a mother myself, of three young children, I know how hard it is to work while raising a family. And I also know that I'm far more fortunate than most. American families need relief. Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties, they should be the norm,"" she said during her speech to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

The U.S. controversy over football players who kneel during the national anthem is raging on.
But an older patriotic ritual ran aground on geopolitical tensions.
That’s the Pledge of Allegiance, which was first recited in public schools on this day in 1892.
The pledge was written by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister and socialist, to be rolled out with a nationwide push to celebrate Columbus Day in schools. It was soon widely recognized.
Mr. Bellamy instructed that a salute be performed with the pledge: right arm extended upward, with the palm twisting up at the first mention of the flag.
When fascist regimes emerged in Italy and Germany using the extended-arm salute, Bellamy’s began to fall from favor. As one author wrote, the “similarities in the salute had begun to attract comment as early as the mid-1930s.”
On Dec. 22, 1942, Congress amended the U.S. Flag Code to instruct that the pledge “be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart” — the stance still in use today.
Charles McDermid contributed reporting.

US should hold China accountable on human rights,"Story highlights Marco Rubio and Chris Smith: In recent years, China has increased censorship, restricted personal freedoms, and violated international standards
The Trump administration should develop a policy approach that holds China accountable for such actions, they write
Marco Rubio and Chris Smith, both Republicans, are the Chair and Co-chair respectively of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. Marco Rubio is the junior senator from Florida and Chris Smith is the US representative for New Jersey's 4th district. This piece expresses solely the views of the authors and has been adapted in part from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China's 2017 report.
(CNN) Next month, President Donald Trump plans to visit Beijing, a trip that will come amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, persistent trade concerns and a raft of other thorny issues in US-China relations. While the President has sought to build a strong personal relationship with Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping -- in part to yield cooperation on North Korean proliferation -- the administration must develop a long-term policy approach that challenges China to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards and embrace the rule of law.
Sen. Marco Rubio
Rep. Chris Smith
Principled American leadership is needed now more than ever. In recent years, the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China's (CECC) annual reports have found that under President Xi's leadership, China has failed to deliver on long-promised economic reforms and has become more authoritarian domestically. It is also increasingly dismissive of international norms and ""Western"" ideas, and more assertive in its extraterritorial reach. The CECC's 2017 Annual Report, which will be released on Thursday, documents even more regression.
Although President Xi has stressed the need for global connectivity and openness, domestic censorship leaves little room for journalism and public debate -- just last week the use of WhatsApp, a popular messaging app, was blocked. As stated in the report, China ""continues to strengthen the world's most sophisticated system of internet control and press censorship and forges ahead with what it calls 'internet sovereignty.'""
Xi has worked hard to consolidate his power, demanding strict ideological discipline from Party and government officials and using an extensive anti-corruption campaign to eliminate many of his political rivals.
Over the past year, Chinese authorities targeted labor and environmental activists; demanded loyalty from scholars and intellectuals; and clamped down on foreign non-governmental organizations, media outlets, think tanks, and internet companies. Restrictions on religious freedom also intensified, particularly in ethnic minority Tibetan and Uyghur areas. Coercive enforcement of population control policies continued in violation of international standards. And the government persisted in forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees to face near certain persecution and even death, in contravention of China's international legal obligations.

"The Choose-Your-Own-Reality Theory of Terror, Mass Shootings and Spiritual Warfare","Op-Ed by Dylan Charles
By now, every possible angle of the Las Vegas shooting has been expounded upon by anyone with a website or a YouTube channel. Without a doubt, something doesn’t add up, but, we’ve gone through this before, many times now, and it never adds up.
And it won’t ever add up, because the self-proclaimed authorities will never acknowledge contrary points of view. They’ll never publicly admit that the official story doesn’t jibe with the totality of facts and thoughtful observations openly available to anyone with an Internet connection and a halfway open mind.
And so we never come to know the whole truth and nothing but the truth. These cases remain open forever. They fester on and on like incurable tumors in the psyche of the body politic, forever generating debate, discussion, discordance, disharmony, infighting, argument and anger. Forever pushing people into psychological traps where reality is whatever best fits with one’s chosen perspective, whatever that may be.
The power structures in place have a firm grip on the controls of the reality generation machine. It’s a top-down system. When an event like Las Vegas happens, the machine goes into action, spinning out variants and possibilities then tossing them into the ether of the collective consciousness. There, facts and fantasies are furiously pecked at and picked over until we’ve had our fill. Then we wait for the next feeding. The next blood-letting.
You see, the real powers in our world don’t care if we know the truth. They don’t care if in all of our theories we do happen to stumble upon the actual story. Their interests aren’t threatened by speculative chatter on the Internet. They’re not challenged by keyboard experts or social media warriors. They’re not afraid of homegrown video analysis and list articles pointing out the obvious. They’re not troubled by snarky know-it-all bloggers. To them we’re just a billion monkeys with a billion typewriters feverishly hoping to accidentally hammer out Homer’s Odyssey.
In fact, they love it when they know that we know. It’s a psychopath thing. You wouldn’t understand.
To the contrary, though. The insane flurry of pseudo-investigative journalism and professional-grade speculation serves them well. It deepens the divide. It stokes more anger, rage, impotency and confusion. It speeds up the fractionation of the public psyche into ever-finer opinion groups and ever-tighter echo chambers. It serves them well to niche us down into evermore subtle corrals of theoretics.
In our uber-connected, news-cycle-driven world, an event like Las Vegas is much more than just murder. It’s a wide detour for public awareness. And it’s a mega pay-day for everyone in the game.
Those pulling the trigger profit by selling us back our peace of mind in the form of security technologies and increased federal budgets for the alphabet agencies of the police state and the Orwellian permanent war tribe.
The 24-7 news teams cash in, too. They gain in audience share and up the price on their advertising space. The pundits get booked overtime presenting, framing, re-framing and re-packaging tidbits of info for public consumption. They sell dark fantasies about what could be and what might come to be, triggering the imagination, stirring up waves of cortisol then selling more pills and products to cope with it all.
The ever-growing body of independent websites and alt-news ventures get to take all this to the bank as well. Speculation is insatiably click-worthy. No one really knows what the hell is going on, but the clicks just keep on coming, so long as we can think of new ways of saying the same things. After all, clicks equal money, and who doesn’t want money? If the theory is just as discreditable as the official story, who cares?
The ritual of terrorism and mass murder events wouldn’t be what it is without the feeding frenzy of content creation, widespread speculation, conjecture, opinion generation, confidence games and outright bullshit. It’s part of the emotional roller coaster we so darkly love. It temporarily fills the void. It’s a little thing we do to feign purpose and meaning amidst our frustrating inability to substantively improve the human condition.
In this environment we are free to choose our own reality, to jump from ship to ship, subscribing and unsubscribing to whatever theory compliments our frame of mind and upholds up our tightly held worldview.
Meanwhile our attention is stolen and misdirected, trained onto the most terrifying of external fascinations. Higher consciousness is pissed into the wind. Love is plowed under by fear, and a spiritual illness metastasizes. The inner being continues to rot and disintegrate.
Suddenly there’s no time for holding space for the victims or for those directly affected. There’s no desire to consciously generate empathy. The task of ferreting out our own darkness and of rooting out our own anger and hate is put on hold for a wild goose chase in search of certainty and consensus. The bigger picture is totally lost in the sensational details of the horror.
The mind convinces itself that it can control the world by wrangling with external circumstances, and that its righteous duty is to submerge itself in the dark minutiae of shock and awe. The psyche is further conditioned to indulge in madness, and the spirit is further tricked into believing that fear has a rightful home in the heart.
It’s a trap within a trick. A tragedy built into a tragedy. A thousand rabbit holes within a rabbit hole. It’s a veil concealing the reality that the matrix is an attention funnel designed to direct our awareness and energy onto a pre-fab spread of pre-packaged, shitty realities. Where attention goes, energy flows. This is spiritual warfare. The enemy’s goal is for us to forget that we are creators of this world and that we have more power than we know what to do with.
This is the age of choose-your-own-reality. It is my suspicion that the world will begin to improve when we consciously enter into the age of create-your-own reality.

Japan to restore neglected gardens abroad,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are about 500 Japanese gardens around the world, such as this one at the World War Two-era Manzanar internment camp for Japanese-Americans in California
Japan is to send gardening experts around the world to restore Japanese-style gardens that have fallen into a state of neglect, officials say.
The gardens have unique features such as stone bridges, ponds, moss-covered paths, stone lanterns and carefully tended miniature trees.
Local gardeners have been overwhelmed by the task of maintaining them.
There are about 500 Japanese gardens around the world of which 40 are in disrepair, the land ministry said.
They require pruning, new plants and trees, and work on traditional stone lanterns that have fallen over.
Officials say the plan is a way of promoting Japanese culture abroad.
Image caption Gardens in Japan such as the Kenroku-en garden in Kanazawa are impeccably maintained
The gardens are used by Japanese groups abroad for tea ceremonies, festivals and other events to introduce people to Japanese culture, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported.
Embassies have asked the government in Tokyo for help to restore the gardens, AFP news agency reported.
The land ministry says it will send a five-person team to rebuild Japanese gardens in Romania and the US state of California later this year.
The ministry also plans to hold lectures and provide manuals to enable local gardeners to maintain the gardens.

The first overseas Japanese garden was created by the Japanese government in 1873 as part of the Vienna World Expo, and the interest it sparked led to more being built.
Further Japanese gardens were created abroad as part of diplomatic initiatives after World War Two.
The gardens measure about 5,000sq m (1.23 acres) each and are present in more than 100 countries, the Asahi Shimbun said."
"Harvey Weinstein is a symptom, but what is the deeper problem?","(CNN) CNN asked a group of women and men -- actors, writers and other thinkers -- to explore questions raised not just by the harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein , but by a series of recent challenges to women that have reopened discussion about sexual harassment, gender and power: What is the biggest impediment to equality for women and girls today? And what made you realize anew that it was there?
The views expressed here are solely those of the authors.
Piper Perabo: Exposing the problem is a first step
I was privileged to learn orienteering as a Girl Scout, work as an au pair in Europe, and take wilderness survival classes in college. When I became an actress, naive as it sounds, I hadn't really hit an obstacle because of my gender. So when the "" Access Hollywood "" tapes came out, and I heard a presidential candidate brag about sexual assault, and with a kind of easy laughter, my knees went weak. And my heart went out to all the young girls who heard it on the news that night, and for the young women who were voting in their first presidential election.
I had a similar feeling after recent news stories recounted allegations against Harvey Weinstein. These famous incidents make the news, but they are not singular. This behavior of white male dominance is understood and cherished -- that's what I hear in the shared laughter on that ""Access Hollywood"" tape. These conversations expose all the work we have to do, just to admit where we're at, so we can find our way to equality, and I see that as a sign of hope.
Piper Perabo is an actress known for her role as CIA agent Annie Walker in the TV series ""Covert Affairs,"" for which she was earned a Golden Globe nomination in 2010. She has appeared in numerous films, including ""Looper,"" ""The Prestige,"" ""Imagine Me and You,"" and her breakout role in ""Coyote Ugly.""

As a teenager on a New Delhi bus, I would invariably feel a hand down my shirt or up my skirt. It was an everyday occurrence. That, on top of an assault at 9, just made the extraordinary event of sexual violence, into the most ordinary thing. I did what most of us do: kept silent.
Poorna Jagannathan
But even at 9, it was a calculated choice. I chose to stay silent because it was better than telling parents and teachers and they not doing/unable to do anything about it. By staying silent, I betrayed just myself. Speaking out would have led to my betrayal by the people I loved the most.
Then, on December 16, 2012, Jyoti Singh Pandey, a 23-year-old medical student, boarded a bus in New Delhi. She was gang-raped, beaten and tortured by six men. Though she lived only for a few days, she found the strength to testify against her attackers, to demand justice for herself. The press called her "" Nibhaya "" -- fearless one.
Her story inspired me and so many women across India and the world to break our silences. We'd had enough. The dam had simply burst. We began to see the violence as extraordinary again.
Silence is a hard thing to understand. I thought it protected me, but it protected my perpetrators. I thought it would end the violence, but it was actually what was perpetuating it. I thought the silence was all mine, but it was what made me deeply complicit in the culture of violence.
JUST WATCHED Bana Alabed's message on #DayOfTheGirl Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bana Alabed's message on #DayOfTheGirl 00:46
My silence, layered on top of the silences of millions of other women, created a system where there was no accountability. When we broke it, we were sure the system would collapse, that our breaking of the silence would end the cycle of violence.
But as more women dare to break their silences, many times at enormous costs to themselves, we are faced with an entirely new reality. There is no real fallout, no real consequences.
Although Kate Winslet has denounced Harvey Weinstein, I'll never forget that line from an interview she gave: ""When Roman Polanski invites you to join him in any project, you really don't say no."" Because I want her, I need her and everyone else to scream ""No."" Because so many of us couldn't -- we were too young, too scared, too frozen. Does violence against women not count? ( Polanski is the film director who fled the United States to avoid prison for raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.)
That apology letter that Harvey Weinstein wrote wasn't the sound of a man oblivious to the gravity of the accusations of sexual harassment and assault that have been made against him. It's the sound of a man who has read so many scripts, he knows the ending better than anyone else. Expect him to lie low for a while, then emerge under a new company with a new name -- maybe with a phoenix-rising logo -- and go back to business as usual.
The system will support his slow integration, while it will continue to betray those who have the courage to speak out.

Rachel Sklar: This is an everywhere story
The allegations against Harvey Weinstein are grotesque and horrifying and familiar. How many women read about Weinstein literally blocking a woman's path, and thought, ""Yep, I've been there""? How many women remembered their own experiences pushing away unwanted embraces and uninvited hands? Or worse?
Rachel Sklar
This isn't just a Hollywood story. This is an everywhere story. It's the story of men in power using and abusing it against women, cajoling and taking, berating and threatening, trapping and menacing. It's the story of women being doubted and called crazy or labeled as gold diggers or attention seekers, or more likely not saying anything at all because by all available metrics that's the safest, easiest way to go. And yes, it's the story of thinking that when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything
There are many things that are truly shocking about the Harvey Weinstein story -- the brazenness of the overtures, the sheer number of women he allegedly harassed, intimidated and forced himself upon -- but the mind reels at realizing just how many people had to have known something for so long. Assistants and producers and actors and publicists and colleagues (and "" procurers "" to make things even grosser) -- that this was such an open secret speaks to the normalization of treating women as casually disposable objects. And it speaks to a culture that not only tolerates, but lionizes, the men who treat them that way.

Don McPherson: Men have to break the silence
Don McPherson
I have been working to prevent men's violence against women since I retired from pro football in 1994. Awareness of the problem has grown, but critical, underlying causes remain unchecked. Men are still silent.
I came to realize we don't raise boys to be men, we raise them not to be women. In other words, we don't deliberately nurture boys to be emotionally whole (and nonviolent). We leave them vulnerable to a broader culture dominated by patriarchy and traditions of silence from men -- about themselves, and the sexism and misogyny that harm women.
To break that silence I examined the culture in which I was nurtured. This led me to a crucial question I ask all men. ""What's the worst insult you heard as a boy?"" The answer: ""You throw like a girl!"" This charge enforces a narrow view of masculinity -- demanding that boys ""man up"" -- and delivers an insidiously dangerous message that girls and women are ""less than.""
My work is focused on the deliberate and intentional engagement of boys and men, not simply to prevent violence against women, but to help boys and men recognize how sexism diminishes them while simultaneously supporting a culture of misogyny and silence about men's violence against women.

Danai Gurira: Listen and learn what it feels like to be a girl
Danai Gurira
On International Day of the Girl, it is important that we remember how much is at stake. Remember the girl in Mali who cannot go to school , but watches her brother go every day. Remember the girl in Chad in a forced marriage, the girl who has never had a chance to explore her potential before becoming a wife, a mother. Remember the girl kidnapped from her school in 2014 in Northern Nigeria, who was forced to become the ""wife"" of a rebel army member and is going through hell daily.
And remember the women right here in the United States, who have been assaulted and violated and disrespected by powerful men and silenced by corrupt systems of power and control. Remember that girl in every woman you encounter who deserves to discover her potential, her power, and how to fly.
She must function in a world that too often treats her like prey, clips her wings, burdens her with tormented memories of fear and shame. Remember that girl today, the same girl inside so many women, full of wounds but bandaged over with silence and a smile.
Remember the world she is in, so often hostile to her truth, to the fullness and volume of her voice. The world that convinces her she is always to blame. Take the time today not only to remember, but to listen, to learn, to start to understand what if feels like, in this world, for a girl. And resolve to make it better. For her.

Erin Richards: We need to teach men how to communicate their feelings to women
Erin Richards
I was speaking to my executive producer about the stories surrounding Harvey Weinstein -- a man whose alleged despicable lechery and abuse of power was widely known among women in my line of business. And we came to the conclusion that though it's been too long coming, these revelations are a positive step forward. As media moguls like Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Roger Ailes and others fall, they send a strong message to other predators that this level of harassment will no longer be tolerated.
But the bigger issue is that we don't teach men how to appropriately communicate their feelings to women. We don't explain to them that being rejected does not make them less of men. We need to give them the correct vocabulary to express themselves. We need to help ingrain in them messages of self-love so that they don't act out their repressed frustrations on others. That's how we will make a safer society for us all.

Reshma Saujani: We need to take power and make opportunity for ourselves
Reshma Saujani
I joined the fight to close the gender gap in tech after a political campaign where I saw coding and robotics classes full of boys. I couldn't stop coming back to the faces I didn't see -- I kept thinking, where are the girls?
I started an organization to do something about that, but these days you can't flip on the TV or check your news feed without hearing about horrible mistreatment of women. Whistleblowers from college campuses to Silicon Valley to Hollywood have begun to bring rampant, closeted sexual harassment out of the shadows, yet for every brave woman who speaks out, hundreds of powerful men remain silent and thus complicit.
These men could turn the tide far faster than women can -- that's a sad but true fact -- and yet they don't. As a result, casual, small acts of sexism may hang around for another whole generation.
That's the bad news. The good news is that as any psychologist or self-empowerment guru will tell you, how we respond and act in the face of that is up to us. I believe we need to stop trying to wrestle for power, respect and opportunities from others and instead make them for ourselves.

Alice Stewart: This is not about politics, it's about an alleged sexual predator
Alice Stewart
When you campaign and write books claiming to be a protector of women, it should take no time for you to condemn the despicable actions of movie mogul and Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein. For some reason, it took former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama five days to tell the world they were disgusted by the allegations against Weinstein. What should have been an instant rebuke took nearly a week of public pressure to come forth.
This includes Clinton and Obama. No word on whether they will return the money (though the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee It just so happens this alleged sexual predator has been hiding in plain sight in Hollywood and Washington for decades and has donated millions of dollars to Democratic candidates over the years.This includes Clinton and Obama. No word on whether they will return the money (though the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has said it will give its donations to women's rights organizations.)
At the end of the day though this is not about politics. This is about a man whose behavior was demeaning and damaging to countless women. Isolated incidents of sexual abuse happen -- what we have here is a trend enabled by people looking the other way for fear of retribution.
The culture of complicity cannot continue. Let's hear these women out, let's support their courage, and let's hold this man accountable for his actions.

Roxanne Jones: Women who wait to report abuse and harassment aren't heroes
Roxanne Jones
It's become the vogue in Hollywood for women to wait decades before speaking out about past sexual assaults or harassment they've faced over their career by powerful men. And while it's nice that these women are finally telling their painful stories publicly, I don't think they are heroes, or even especially courageous.
Too harsh you say? Not at all. For me, settling for a huge financial settlement from your employer, writing a book or even worse -- staying silent when confronted by a predator at work -- is the weakest move we can make as women who profess to want full equality and respect. And while it may keep you safe for a moment or gainfully employed, your silence puts every other woman at risk for harassment, or much worse.
Workplace harassment isn't just a Hollywood problem. Working women face these predators every day. I've been there myself as a young woman on a fast-track career, who was harassed and groped by a bully at work. Many advised me to stay quiet. Instead, that week I reported the incident not just to human resources but to the head of the company. And yes, I was terrified that I'd ruin my career. I didn't, as far as I know.
Whether it's Weinstein's accusers, the scores of women who accused Bill Cosby, or even top anchors such as Gretchen Carlson who won a $20 million suit after Fox CEO Roger Ailes allegedly harassed her at work -- it's hard for me to find much reason to hope that we are any closer to full equality using this passive-aggressive strategy to gain equal rights.
Let's stop hiding our pain in the closet hoping it will go away. Hoping men will accept us if we stay pretty, silent and compliant. Each of us finding our voice is the only path to true empowerment.

Porochista Khakpour: Women in America are second-class citizens at best, and this is unacceptable
Porochista Khakpour
I'm sad to say I've been aware of gender inequities since I was a young child, a refugee leaving Iran. It was clear that with the mandatory veil the new regime in Iran had decided that women were not worthy of choice. One would have hoped that traveling to the West and relocating to America would have meant an end to all that, but the sexism I experienced in the United States was consistent and with no end in sight -- in the classroom by pupils and teachers, in the workplace by colleagues and bosses, everywhere.
I've been raped, assaulted or sexually harassed so many times in my life. I now think with the Trump administration we are further than ever from resolving all this. Our greatest impediment is a President who has proudly harassed and allegedly sexually assaulted numerous women. We need to set ourselves apart from this and work harder than ever to make this place safer for the generations to come. Women in this supposedly greatest nation in the world are currently second-class citizens at best, and we need to let it be known vocally this is unacceptable.

Jill Filipovic: How far misogyny can take you in America
Jill Filipovic
I've been writing about women's rights for more than a decade, mostly online, with the attendant verbal attacks -- first in blog and website comment sections, and later on social media. I've had stalkers and received rape and death threats. There is not a day that goes by without someone berating me online, not a misogynist slur I have not been called hundreds of times. I thought I knew misogyny.
And then the Republican nominee for President was caught bragging about grabbing women by their genitals, and won the election anyway.
Women -- and men -- need to acknowledge what this means: We already knew that sexual abusers could for years operate under the radar of high-profile industries, as has been alleged with Harvey Weinstein.
But women are even further away from safety and equality than the most cynical feminists believed when an admitted sexual predator can actually win a national election.
It wasn't a surprise that someone such as Donald Trump would yuck it up about sexual assault, or that women accused him of doing what he said he did. Nor was it a surprise that the more craven members of the Republican Party would back him if it meant getting their way on racist immigration bans or tax cuts for the rich they sought. But nearly all of them?
And so many men -- most men -- voted for him. And not as many, but still so very many, women -- typically white women, typically married to men -- voted for him, too. Women are nowhere near safe when so many of our family members and friends, our husbands and brothers and sons, support an unrepentant misogynist, or conclude deep disdain for women is something that can be put aside for politics; we are not equal when so many women decided the humanity of their sisters didn't matter.
Now, the administration of an American president in 2017 is showing women what it thinks of them -- weakening birth control access , attacking abortion rights, undermining fair pay laws and more.
I assumed we could mostly agree that misogyny and sexual violence were bad; I assumed my online tormenters were sexist outliers. It turns out we can't, because they are Trump's America. They've always been haranguing women on Twitter. I just didn't think they'd make it to the White House.

Ai-jen Poo: Understanding where the inequity lies
Ai-jen Poo
The first step to achieving gender equity is understanding where the inequity lies. Discovering that requires the bravery of women to come forward with their stories. In this context, we assume the moment of courage is breaking the silence -- which requires immense courage -- but in reality, life after the silence is broken can be the hardest part.
When I was in college, I worked as a hotline volunteer at a domestic violence shelter for Asian immigrant women. The women I spoke to were mostly mothers, and a significant motivation for leaving their abusers was the safety of their children. The majority of those women worked in garment factories, restaurants and in homes as caregivers or house cleaners. Many worked long hours, but it never seemed to be enough to pay the rent or put food on the table. And so they often ended up back in the shelter or back with their abusers.
That women suffer abuse, harassment or inequity in the workplace is undeniable. But the challenges faced after speaking out are so enormous that many women keep their stories silent for years and years, as we read in the news, or are forced back into cycles of violence, as I heard on the hotline. We need to ensure women are heard, but also supported -- with economic opportunities and supportive communities -- afterward. The only thing worse than silence is isolation and vulnerability after the silence is broken.
Oset Babur: The biggest impediment to equality is a lack of trust in women
Oset Babur
As someone who attended a women's college, I've been asked time and time again, often by men, what the objective of such an institution is in the 21st century. After all, women can now apply to schools whose classrooms were once off-limits and find themselves at the head of boardrooms that were once inaccessible, right? But in this century, the President of the United States brags that his star power gives him rights to women's bodies, as a trusty tool in committing sexual assault, and in this century, our first instinct is to subject repeatedly every decision women make (whether it be about their reproductive health, or speaking up against abuse) to an intense level of scrutiny that could do wonders if it were put to use in, say, anti-gun legislation, universal health care or education.
The biggest impediment to gender equality I see in 2017 is a universal lack of trust toward women. This distrust is reinforced every single time a senior executive repurposes a female colleague's ideas as his own, and every time someone without the ability to become pregnant makes a decision on behalf of those who can. And while it's true that trust is usually earned, it just isn't up to women anymore to earn this trust; it's up to everyone else (from Harvey Weinstein to Donald Trump) to show that they are deserving of it.

Peggy Drexler: Women aren't turning out for feminism
Peggy Drexler
It's commendable, of course, that after the raft of horrendous sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein and other major power brokers in the media, more and more women are speaking out against the men who abuse positions of power at their expense. Or against the industries that compensate men at a higher level than women. But the root of the problem lies much deeper.
When Hillary Clinton lost a presidency to a white man far less qualified, far less prepared and far more volatile, it became clear that women were perhaps just as culpable as men in the fight against systemic inequality. And not just the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump -- many who did so because they were uncomfortable voting for a woman, or could not get past the sexist stereotypes that were continually hung around this woman. But also the many millennial women who, too, resisted Clinton because of her gender.
These are women who aren't turning out for feminism, or who don't take it seriously -- who view the fight as outdated because they never had to fight it themselves. Or so they think. Because the fight is far from over. The allegations against Weinstein are only the latest expression of this. My greatest hope is that those who have the power, and need, to stand up for women will realize it's not only entirely relevant, but essential that they do so. My greatest fear, however, is that they will not.

Naaz Modan: Being judged by what you wear
Naaz Modan
Shortly after I decided to wear the hijab, I noticed a shift in how I was perceived in public and professional settings. My contribution to academic discussions as a college student was received with surprise at my intelligence, and now my work as journalist is oftentimes taken with a grain -- or mountain -- of salt by readers. Comments I've received range from ""The author of this wears a scarf"" to ""We don't need to hear about America's problems from you in a hijab."" My perceived intellect and the amount of influence I command in a room are dictated in others' minds by the clothes I wear.
There is a similar struggle on the opposite end of the spectrum, where a woman's value and experiences in the workplace are determined by the amount of skin she chooses to show and how she chooses to show it.
On one end, if she shows ""too little"" or chooses to cover with a scarf, she is considered sexually oppressed and intellectually stunted, whereas if she shows ""too much,"" she is reducing herself to her sexuality and ultimately asking to be assaulted. Nowhere is this clearer than in the most recent case of Harvey Weinstein, where the women who came forward were criticized for how they presented themselves.
This kind of gender-based power dynamic permeates every woman's experience to some extent, whether she is fully covered or not, sometimes even before she enters the workplace.

Jeff Yang: Whose stories get believed
Jeff Yang
I feel like there wasn't any singular moment when the degree of work needed was suddenly made plain. It's always been there -- but always suppressed, overlooked and dismissed. I think that the reporting around sexual harassment in Silicon Valley, in which a disproportionate number of the victims stepping forward were Asian-American women, in particular hammered home to me that there are layered aspects to who's targeted, how they respond, whose stories are believed. Women of color are most frequently ignored, and Asian-American women frequently subjected to stereotypical expectations of silence and passivity.
That intersectional context is too often set to the side in these debates, and it shouldn't be.

Hillary Clinton is a Professional Flip-Flopper,"Hillary Clinton is a Professional Flip-Flopper
(Before It's News)

By Dave King
During the first Bill Clinton presidential campaign, Hillary swore to “stand by her man” and make him cookies, much like a typical housewife would do, and contrary to everything she believes in today.
During Bill Clinton’s re-election campaign Hillary headed up the Bimbo Eruption squad that attacked women who mentioned their relations with Bill. So these women who opposed the bad treatment that Bill meted out are, in Hillary’s opinion, bad women when they complain about Bill’s bad acts? Meanwhile, feminists call all men predators and let Bill slide.
During her post-White House years, Hillary proclaimed that women should be treated equally with men. As a test of just how serious feminists are with the women being equal to men thing, recently Joy Behar, of The View television show, criticized Mike Huckabee for allowing his daughter to work for Donald Trump’s administration, as though his daughter could not make up her own mind whom to work for, and as though Donald Trump is nearly the risk for a woman to work for that Bill Clinton is. Just ask Monica Lewinski.
During Hillary’s Senate and Secretary of State years, while she insisted that women should be paid equally with men, she consistently paid women on her staff less than her male employees.
During Hillary’s own presidential candidacy she ran as a female victim to be pitied for her mistreatment, and in her speeches she told every woman that they must vote for her or they would be letting all women down, indicating that voting for Hillary was an obligation owed her by all women. But would one be mistaken to believe that the president serves the entire nation and not only the female part of the nation? Does Hillary, given her self-absorption and her radical feminism, understand this aspect of the presidency?
During Hillary’s 2016 post-presidential run she claimed that American women allowed their husbands to instruct them to vote for Trump and not her. Does Hillary really believe that women are so stupid and weak that they can be told for whom to vote?
These examples of flip-flopping are a separate subject from the many lies Hillary has told publicly, such as flying into a war zone with Chelsea on board the aircraft and having to cork-screw down in order to avoid enemy fire while landing, and getting her first name as a sign of her mother’s respect for Sir Edmond Hillary after he scaled Mount Everest.
Hillary will use any misguided illogic to get votes and followers. One time she’ll be the dutiful wife, the next time she’ll be a con-woman trying to force all women to vote for her out of a misguided sense of duty to all other women, and then she’ll be abusive to her political base as she criticizes any woman as being a traitor if they didn’t cast a vote for her. It sounds like Hillary is against the principle of letting women make up their own minds about who is the best candidate to represent them for president. It reminds one of Hillary’s “deplorable” comments which lost her many votes in the last election.
It’s too bad Hillary is just unable to gain people’s votes, men’s and women’s alike, based on her being a good candidate and not a shrill, unpleasant liar every time she opens her mouth. But given her inability to will elections, I kind of like her just the way she is.

Student confesses in fatal shooting of police officer at Texas college: warrant,"(Reuters) - A 19-year-old student confessed to fatally shooting a Texas Tech University police officer hours after the suspect’s family warned the school he could be suicidal, according to police and an arrest warrant posted online on Tuesday.
Hollis Daniels was arrested on Monday night following a lockdown at the school and charged with killing officer Floyd East, Texas Tech Police Chief Kyle Bonath told reporters. Texas Tech is in Lubbock, about 300 miles (480 km) west of Dallas.
Daniels’ records posted online by the Lubbock County Jail did not list an attorney. The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported that he was a freshman from Seguin, Texas, near San Antonio.
Bonath said that Texas Tech police received a report of a possibly armed student acting erratically, and sent two officers to Daniels’ dorm room.
The officers found drug paraphernalia in the room, and when Daniels arrived, arrested him, and took him to the university police station, Bonath said.
Daniels pulled a gun at the police station, shot East in the head and fled on foot before being caught, officials said.

An arrest warrant filed by Lubbock police said Daniels stated at the beginning of an interview with two detectives that he had shot the officer and done “something illogical,” according to the warrant posted online by local media.
A Texas Tech spokesman told ABC News that a family call had led university police to check on Daniels.
Bonath said that the Texas Tech counseling center got a call earlier on Monday from Daniels’ family saying he may have a weapon and be suicidal.
Bonath was not clear about when the counseling center called police.
East, 48, had worked since May as an officer at the Lubbock campus. He began working for the university’s El Paso campus in 2014. East is survived by a wife and two daughters, Bonath said.
“First and foremost, our hearts go out to the family of the police officer killed at Texas Tech University,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement."

Is 16th-century charcoal sketch a naked Mona Lisa?,"PARIS (Reuters) - A French art expert believes a charcoal drawing kept in a collection for more than 150 years may be a preparatory sketch made by Leonardo da Vinci of the Mona Lisa.
The black-and-white drawing of a woman, nude from the waist up, known as the Monna Vanna, was previously attributed to Leonardo’s studio, suggesting it was done in his style by a pupil or follower, not by the master himself.
But after preliminary tests at the Louvre Museum, experts believe the sketch may well have been drawn by Leonardo.
Among the signs, according to curator Mathieu Deldicque, are the fact the drawing was made during the same period as the Mona Lisa, the paper is from the same region of Italy, and the technique is very similar to that of the Mona Lisa.
“We know the drawing was made during the lifetime of Leonardo da Vinci, we know that the paper was made in Italy, between Venice and Florence, and the third discovery is the high quality of this drawing in the face of the Monna Vanna and in her arms,” Deldicque told reporters.
“That’s very interesting because the arms are the same as the Mona Lisa‘s.”
Leonardo, who lived from 1452 to 1519, was an engineer, scientist, inventor and sculptor, as well as one of the finest artists of the Italian Renaissance.
He painted the Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda and regarded as the world’s most valuable artwork, at the beginning of the 16th century. It is believed to depict Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a successful merchant.
EXCITING
The charcoal portrait, in which the woman is holding a similar pose to the Mona Lisa but with her body more side-on and her head turned further over her left shoulder, has been held in a collection at the Conde Museum at the Palace of Chantilly, north of Paris, since 1862.
The Mona Lisa and Monna Vanna hold their hands in very similar ways, the right hand across the left and resting on the forearm, the fingers gently extended.
Deldicque said that while it was exciting to think the charcoal drawing was created by Leonardo, there were more tests to be done.
“We have one more month of analysis and then a very slow process of history of art with a collection of analysts and advice by specialists,” he said.
It is possible that process will determine that the authorship is the same. But it may also be inconclusive, he said, adding: “Maybe the mystery will remain.”

Eminem unleashes on Trump at the BET awards,"(CNN) In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem ""came to stomp"" Tuesday night, calling the President everything from ""Donald the b----"" to a ""racist grandpa"" in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap.
The Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to ""decide who you like more"" -- Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle ""Campaign Speech"" and in Big Sean's ""No Favors.""
""And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this. F--- you,"" he said toward the end, raising his middle finger.
A request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.
The latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called ""The Storm,"" comes as anticipation for Eminem's eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump's comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, questioned the President's own patriotism following his attacks on athletes and Sen. John McCain, and in closing, issued a passionate tribute to Colin Kaepernick.
I appreciate you @Eminem ?? pic.twitter.com/nwavBwsOkQ — Colin Kaepernick (@Kaepernick7) October 11, 2017
""I appreciate you @Eminem,"" Kaepernick tweeted, along with a fist emoji.
The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is now a free agent after he rose to national prominence last fall when he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality. Eminem previously expressed his support for Kaepernick in ""Campaign Speech.""
Here are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear:
1) 'A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust'
Here's the full verse: ""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s--- to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops.""
Here, Eminem is likely referencing Trump's war of words on social media with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as ""little rocket man.""
2) 'Trump, when it comes to giving a s--- you're stingy as I am'
This line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America.
3) 'Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange'
4) 'Cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump'
Here's the full verse: ""That's why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That's why he keeps screaming, 'Drain the swamp,' cause he's in quicksand.""
Here, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President.
5) 'All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm'
""But this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.""
Here, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster.
6) 'Who's going to pay for his extravagant trips'
Full verse: ""He says he wants to lower our taxes, then who's going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?""
Last month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code.
7) 'Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more'
Full verse: ""Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that's black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.""
Here, Eminem is referring to Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News.
8) 'This racist 94-year old grandpa'
This line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America's racist past.
9) 'To him, you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured'
""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b-------, Unless you're a POW who's tortured ... cause to him you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured. That's not disrespecting the military.""
Eminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military -- a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump's previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, ""I like people that weren't captured, OK?""
10) 'F--- that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald the b----'

11) 'The rest of America stand up. We love our military and we love our country but we f------ hate Trump'"
How Jimmy Kimmel became America's conscience,"If, at any earlier time in his career, anyone had suggested to Jimmy Kimmel that people would someday be citing him as the conscience of the nation, he would surely have done the world's greatest spit-take.
But just a couple of weeks after his emotional stand against the latest Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Kimmel is back stage center, this time in the renewed debate about gun control. Kimmel's impassioned, tearful plea for action on guns after his hometown of Las Vegas was ravaged by a killer wielding an arsenal was the centerpiece of a universal cry of despair that marked the response to the tragedy among late-night television hosts Monday night.
And Kimmel is, indeed, being showered in praise by gun control advocates for taking the outspoken stand he did in his opening monologue.
Of course, he is being equally assailed by pro-gun advocates on the right for using his entertainment platform to advance views they dismiss as liberal nonsense. If they were going to pummel him on social media for taking a stand after nearly losing his newborn son, they surely weren't going to allow him a shred of credit for putting his human face on the gun-control debate.
Related: Jimmy Kimmel gets emotional after shooting in his hometown
Welcome to politics in the Trump era, Jimmy.
The truth is, Kimmel has been acutely aware that putting himself out there on both these issues meant sticking his head straight into the political maelstrom that afflicts the nation at this moment in history. He told people, including me, that he expected heavy blowback from conservative and pro-Trump voices.
But he didn't choose either fight as much as they chose him. As a late-night host, Kimmel has never sought the mantle of political activism; events have thrust that upon him.
Before the frightening experience surrounding the birth of his son, Billy, Kimmel did not belong in the company of the most vociferous late-night political satirists, like Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Samantha Bee and John Oliver. He took plenty of shots at the Trump Administration, but less in outrage than stupefaction. He never set out to score political points, only to get laughs.
Kimmel was sucked into the political maelstrom by the commitment that Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, made: That for him to support it, any new health-care bill would have to pass the ""Jimmy Kimmel test."" When Cassidy's own bill clearly did not do that, in Kimmel's view, Kimmel felt honor-bound to speak out on behalf of families whose lives would be forever altered (and perhaps damaged) by the law.
Then this week's mass murder happened to take place in Kimmel's hometown. Again, an emotional connection became too powerful a force to be ignored. When Kimmel appeared Monday night, choked up by the images of slaughter he had seen, he again conveyed a message in terms most people not stuck in ideological cement shoes could understand.
He was effective for a reason that is completely antithetical to the charges of Hollywood elitism that many on the right have hurled at him. Kimmel simply sounds like a regular guy making reasonable points -- because he is a regular guy. Probably more than any other current late-night host, Kimmel projects solid working-class and family values. He seems to most viewers a guy who could share a beer and slice of pizza with anybody.
So when he is on the edge of emotional breakdown over his fears for his newborn son, or the massacre of innocent people in his hometown, it does not come across to most viewers as Hollywood activism; it comes across as human activism.
It is telling that the blowback fired at Kimmel on social media over his commentary on Las Vegas was an orgy of what-about-ism: How come he didn't take umbrage about so many gun deaths in Chicago? What about all the babies being aborted? Why no tears for Islamic terror attacks? Surely Kimmel was getting more talking points from Chuck Schumer (he acknowledged talking to the Senate Minority leader during the health-care debate). And what about how he has beefed up his own security detail with guys who likely carry guns?
Related: Did Jimmy Kimmel kill the health care bill?
That absolutely none of the attacks addressed the issues Kimmel raised is par for the course in this debate. That some points are absurd -- he needed more security because of threats from people who opposed his views, and when did he say no security professional should be responsibly armed? -- is evidence that coherence has no place in ideological warfare.
His critics also don't acknowledge -- or simply don't care -- that he has had a real personal stake in the positions he has taken; instead they trot out the familiar trope about ""Hollywood elitists"" and how out of touch they are with real people. But Kimmel's public image is antithetical to elitism; he presents as entirely down to earth, even salt of the earth.
Certainly, Kimmel made many tough points in his editorial monologue Monday night. He suggested the politicians who have opposed what he believes is responsible gun regulation and instead constantly resort to offering thoughts and prayers ""should be praying to God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country, because it's so crazy.""
But he also cited his own experience seeing how fires in Las Vegas when he was 13 had led to a terrible death toll -- and then real change that has resulted in laws insisting on increased fire protection. ""Why would we approach this differently?"" Kimmel asked. ""It's a public safety issue.""
None of the tweets and articles in conservative media denouncing him addressed that point.
In the short term, the outspoken stands Kimmel has taken on these hot-button issues have clearly raised his profile, and maybe his ratings. The tearful monologue he delivered Monday soared well past 3 million views on YouTube Tuesday.
But Kimmel surely meant it Monday when he said: ""I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this. I just want to give you something to laugh about at night.""
Lately, he's been giving a bit more than that."
Kenyan Election Officials Open New Vote to All Original Candidates,"But in its ruling, the court found that senior poll officials had not followed electoral procedures properly to ensure a credible vote. It was the first time in Africa that a court had nullified the election of an incumbent.
For weeks since the court ruling, Mr. Odinga has demanded that senior poll officials be replaced and prosecuted. He has also called for the replacement of the companies in charge of printing ballot papers and providing the devices needed for the electronic transmission of results, areas that the court found to have been flawed.
Western diplomats have criticized Mr. Odinga for making too many demands, which could have the effect of undermining confidence in the electoral commission’s ability to hold the new vote. Mr. Odinga has called for protests to take place until the commission makes the changes he seeks.
On Wednesday, hundreds of his supporters demonstrated in Nairobi, the capital, and in some opposition strongholds around the country, demanding the resignation of senior election officials.

“Can you go into an election with the same cooks who poisoned your food?” said Janet Ongera, an opposition lawmaker from Kisii, a city in western Kenya.
“This will add even more sulfuric acid,” Ms. Ongera added. “What we want is a level playing field.”
Since the Supreme Court’s ruling in September, Mr. Odinga and Mr. Kenyatta, along with the electoral commission, have failed to reach an agreement on how to conduct the new election.
Analysts say that with shrinking campaign funds and worries of eroding support, Mr. Odinga was most likely playing for time by withdrawing from the race.

Mr. Odinga appeared to be pushing for a later date for the new election, based on his interpretation of a 2013 ruling that calls for a new vote to take place within 90 days if a candidate suddenly dies. An extended campaign would give the authorities more time to make the electoral changes sought by Mr. Odinga.
Earlier in the day, before the election commission’s decision, Kenya’s Parliament passed a set of amendments to the electoral law that seemed intended to ensure a victory by Mr. Kenyatta. One measure said that in an election or runoff with only two candidates, if one withdraws, the other would be automatically declared the winner.
Another amendment would bar the Supreme Court from nullifying a presidential election unless violations of the Constitution or electoral law significantly altered the outcome.
That measure was widely criticized as an attempt by the government to clip the judiciary’s wings. Although the parliamentary vote was boycotted by opposition lawmakers, it passed with the support of Mr. Kenyatta’s party."

"At Frankfurt Book Fair, Politics Loom Large","Photo
“Books are the best weapons,” President Emmanuel Macron of France said at the opening of the Frankfurt Book Fair, addressing the unifying power of literature and language. “Without culture, there is no Europe.”
The French leader, who joined Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the opening ceremony of the world’s oldest book fair Tuesday night, spoke of culture’s crucial role in Europe, and of how it can be a unifying force at a time of rising nationalism. France is the guest of honor this year, and more than 7,000 exhibitors from over 100 countries are expected to attend.
“Identity of language lives through the confrontations with other languages,” Mr. Macron said.
He also asked Ms. Merkel to join him in his vision for overhauling the European Union, which he said in a speech in Paris last month was “too slow, too weak, too ineffective.”
“History shows that in order to further develop Europe, we need impulses from Germany and France,” Ms. Merkel responded, agreeing with the French president on the importance of culture, but remaining vague about whether she endorsed his plans to overhaul the bloc.

Brazilian activist awarded for fight against Amazon rainforest dam,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Brazilian activist on Tuesday won a top international honor for her long fight against a giant hydroelectric dam in the Amazon rainforest that has forced tens of thousands of indigenous people from their homes.
Antonia Melo is the first Brazilian to receive the Alexander Soros Foundation Award for Environmental and Human Rights Activism, designed to expose the impacts of projects such as the Belo Monte dam on the Xingu river.
The project, which will be one of the world‘s largest hydroelectric dams, will flood a swathe of biodiverse rainforest inhabited by the indigenous Xinguense people.
“This award will strengthen and shed light on our fight against this dam,” Melo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Melo, 64, has been campaigning against the dam for more than two decades. Born in Brazil’s Northeast region, she moved to the Amazon region where the dam is being built when she was 4 years old.
“I consider myself a Xinguense,” she said.
Belo Monte is the largest and most high-profile of an estimated 100 hydropower projects planned for the Brazilian Amazon.
Some 40,000 people from small, riverside communities have already been forced from their homes by the project, twice as many as were projected before construction began in 2011, Melo said.
“Evictions are a very violent process that will remain in our hearts forever,” she said.
A federal court in September suspended again the operating license for the dam, saying Norte Energia, the consortium running the project, did not comply with commitments made when it won the bid.
A Brasilia-based court ordered further construction halted until the consortium meets commitments to provide adequate housing for those driven from their homes.
Norte Energia has denied that it has failed to provide adequate housing and said it is complying with all commitments made when it won the tender.
Alexander Soros, founder of the Alexander Soros Foundation, said the award aims to shed light on the potentially damaging impact of megaprojects that could be more “environmentally catastrophic” than are logging and mining operations.
Environmental and land rights problems have worsened in Brazil amid political turmoil, corruption scandals and the country’s worst recession in decades, Soros said."
NC State may be Legit,"NC State may be Legit
(Before It's News)
I know, I know, I know, most fans read that tag line and say to themselves, “of course NC State is legit, where have you been?” If you have that thought, you haven’t been a fan of NC State very long, or talked to any fan about the football program.
With a road win over Florida State, they showed that they can win with programs that have cache in the ACC. They backed that up with a win versus Syracuse. Previous NC State teams would have wilted against the Orange, and found a way to lose that game. This team didn’t, not only did they not lose that game, they came back home and had their most impressive game of the Daven Doeren era. This team proved that they need to be taken seriously. They proved that they are more then just that impressive front 4. They proved that on offense, they aren’t just Jaylen Samuels. Ryan Finley can run the offense and has shown the ability and willingness to go down field. The offensive line has been playing well and protecting Finley.
This team does have the inexplicable loss to start the season in Charlotte against University of South Carolina. A game in which NC State totally dominated the stat sheet, but not on the score board. They followed that up with 2 lackluster performances against Marshal and Furman. Then something happened. Someone turned on a switch, or sprinkled the magic fairy dust, or slipped something in the Gatorade at practices. They started to dominate the line of scrimmage. This is where NC State turned the corner from an okay 7-8 win team, to a possible 10 win team. They have the horses to win 10 games. They have some tough games ahead, at Notre Dame, versus Clemson at home, at Wake Forest.
This entire blog post might be a mute point if NC State goes up to Pittsburgh and lays an egg. And if you don’t think that’s possible, I’ll give you losses last year against BC at home and East Carolina on the road.
Do I think this will happen? No, no I don’t. The defensive line is playing out of their minds, Bradley Chubb is wreaking havoc against offensive linemen. The offense is proving that they are explosive and when they need a score, they put the ball in the endzone and take your teams heart. Don’t believe me, go and watch the second half of the Louisville. Watch, each time Louisville got close, Finley, Samuels, Harmon, and Hines responded with touchdowns……

Asahi considering selling stake in Tsingtao Brewery,"FILE PHOTO: A pint of Asahi lager beer is seen in a bar in Singapore June 17, 2017. Picture taken June 17, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Asahi Group Holdings said on Thursday it is considering selling all or part of its 19.99 percent stake in Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd, its latest divestment from China’s beer industry as it seeks growth in Europe and other Asian markets.
Asahi’s decision to sell the stake, which it acquired in 2009 for around $666.50 million, follows its announcement in June to sell its 20 percent stake in Chinese brewer Tingyi-Asahi Beverages Holding Co Ltd for $612 million.
Tsingtao said Asahi holds 270.1 million of its Hong Kong listed H-shares. At Thursday’s closing price, the stake would be valued at nearly HK$8.5 billion ($1.09 billion).
The maker of Japan’s best-selling beer, Asahi Super Dry, has been intensifying its focus on Europe, scooping up a group of eastern European beer brands from Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) for 7.3 billion euros late last year.
That move gave the company around 9 percent of the European beer market, excluding Russia.
“We are engaging in efforts to ‘restructure our business portfolio with a focus on asset efficiency,’ to assess whether each business contributes to sustainable enhancement of corporate value,” Asahi said in a statement.
The company has said that it would restructure its operations in Southeast Asia and China, regions which are facing increased competition as the market consolidates just as growth slows.
It did not identify a potential buyer or selling price for the stake.
Tsingtao’s shares in Hong Kong ended down 2.3 percent before the announcement, and have struggled for traction over the past 12 months.
China is the world’s largest beer market by sales, but profits have been harder to come by amid fierce competition between local brewers and global beer giants AB InBev, Heineken NV and Carlsberg."
11 Signs of a False Flag,"Brandon Turbeville
 Activist Post
 
Throughout history, versions of the false flag attack have been used successfully by governments in order to direct the force of the people toward whatever end the ruling class may be seeking. At times, that end may be war, or it may be the curtailing of domestic civil liberties and basic human rights. In others, it is an economic agenda.
 
Indeed, false flags are themselves capable of taking on a wide variety of forms – domestic or foreign, small or large, economic or political, and many other designations that can often blur into one another. Each may serve a specific purpose and each may be adjusted and tailored for that specific purpose as societal conditions require.
 
For instance, the chemical weapons attack which took place inside Syria in August, 2013 serve as an example of a foreign false flag designed to whip up American fervor for war, on the platform of Responsibility to Protect similar to the Gulf of Tonkin.
 
Domestically speaking, a large-scale false flag such as 9/11, can be used to whip up both a massive public support for war and a popular willingness to surrender civil liberties, constitutional procedure, and constitutional/human rights. Economic false flags may take the form of manufactured “government shutdowns” or “government defaults” designed to create a demand for austerity or other pro-Wall Street solutions. Lastly, smaller-scale domestic false flags such as Sandy Hook or Aurora, often involve the implementation of gun-control measures or a greater police state.
 
There are, of course, many different versions of false flag attacks and none fit into a tightly crafted classification beyond the generalized term “false flag.” As stated above, some false flags may indeed embrace an element of each of the different versions listed previously both in terms of methodology and purpose.
 
 
With that in mind, it is also true that, while massive false flag attacks are always a possibility, it has been the small-scale false flags coming in the form of “shooters” (most often of the “lone gunmen” variety), that have been used most effectively by the ruling class and its mouthpiece media outlets in recent years. While the scale of the attacks have diminished, their frequency has rapidly increased.
 
However, due to a growing competent alternative media and researching community, as fast as the false flag attacks are launched, a volley of deconstructions of the official narratives are being provided. While many criticisms of the official version of events are wildly incredible, bordering on paranoia and impossibility, there are capable outlets and researchers who are able to expose the false flag for what it is. Indeed, it is for this reason that the false flag has suffered serious setbacks in terms of its effectiveness as of late and why it continues to do so.
 
Because the false flag attack is designed to instill fear, panic, and a guided response from the general public, it is important to deconstruct the narrative of that attack as it is presented. However, we cannot simply be consumed by attempting to expose and deconstruct every false flag attack that comes our way. We cannot ignore the greater issues, the winnable battles, and the demands we must be making simply to expose each and every false flag. We cannot ignore the forest fire to extinguish the occasional burning bush. The false flag, after all, is only the symptom of the disease.
 
For that reason, it is important to enable the general public to recognize the false flag itself, not simply the questionable elements of a particular false flag which will soon be overtaken by a new one. We must train both ourselves and the public to recognize the signs of the false flag when it happens and thus render the attack neutral.
 
The following is a list of some of the most common elements of the false flag attack which should immediately be looked at in the event of some other incident that pulls at the heartstrings and emotions of the general public.
 
1. High Profile Event: The first question to ask would be “Is this a high profile incident?” The answer, of course, is fairly obvious. If an attack takes place at the World Trade Center complex causing the buildings to explode and collapse, or if it takes place at the White House, or Pentagon, it is clearly high profile. Thus, the location can be factored in. In other circumstances, however, the act itself may be the major factor such as the case in Sandy Hook Elementary School, a nationally unimportant location but a horrific act that made national news nonetheless. The most important factor, of course, is media attention. Regardless of location or the act, if the media picks up the story and runs it simultaneously on all major mainstream channels, the incident can be considered a “high profile event.”
 
2. Changing Stories: In informed researching circles, it is well-known that the information that comes out shortly after the event is usually the most reliable. This is not to discount the existence of confusion related to panicked reports coming from eyewitnesses and the like. However, the information coming out early on has not yet been subjected to the top-down media revision that will inevitably take place as the story becomes molded to fit the narrative pushed by the individuals who either directed the attack at the higher levels or at least have connections with those who are able to control the manner in which various media outlets report the event.
 
For instance, in times of false flag attacks, the initial reports may point to 5 gunmen. Very shortly after, reports may only mention two. Only a few hours after the attack, however, all references to more than one gunmen are removed entirely, with only the “lone gunman” story remaining. Any other mention of additional gunmen after this point is ridiculed as “conspiracy theory.”
 
3. Simultaneous Drills: One hallmark of the false flag operation is the running of drills shortly before or during the actual attack. Many times, these drills will involve the actual sequence of events that takes place during the real life attack . These drills have been present on large scale false flags such as 9/11 as well as smaller scale attacks like the Aurora shooting.
 
For instance, as Webster Tarpley documents in his book 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made In USA, at least 46 drills were underway in the months leading up to 9/11 and on the morning of the attack. These 46 drills were all directly related to the events which took place on 9/11 in some way or other.[1] Likewise, the 7/7 bombings in London were running drills of exactly the same scenario that was occurring at exactly the same times and locations.
 
Although one reason may take precedence over the other depending on the nature and purpose of the operation drills are used by false flag operators for at least two reasons. One such purpose is the creation of intentional confusion if the drill is taking place during the actual attack. The other, more effective aspect, however, is using the drill as a cloak to plan the attack or even “go live” when it comes time to launch the event. Even more so, it gives the individuals who are involved in the planning of the event an element of cover, especially with the military/intelligence agency’s tight chain of command structure and need-to-know basis. If a loyal military officer or intelligence agent stumbles upon the planning of the attack, that individual can always be told that what he has witnessed is nothing more than the planning of a training exercise. This deniability continues all the way through to the actual “going live” of the drill. After the completion of the false flag attack, Coincidence Theory is used to explain away the tragic results.[2]
 
4. Cui Bono? The most important question to ask immediately after any high profile incident is “cui bono?” or “Who benefits?” If one is able to see a clear benefit to any government, corporation, or bank, then the observer becomes capable of seeing through the false flag attack immediately. Many of these questions can be answered by taking a closer look at the behavior of these organizations prior to the attack and shortly thereafter.[3]
 
For instance, the presence of legislation which would stand little chance of being passed before the attack but which is quickly passed (or at least heavily pushed) afterwards is one clue that the conveniently timed attack was actually a false flag. Patriot Act style legislation was actually written before 9/11 but stood little chance of passing in Congress due to the political climate in the United States at the time. After 9/11, however, the Patriot Act was fast-tracked through both Houses of Congress with virtually no debate and with the blessing of the American people.
 
Returning to 9/11, it is a fact that a number of individuals who were in positions of power within the US government during the time the attack occurred had desperately wanted to invade several Middle Eastern countries.[4] After the attacks, a war psychosis gripped the ruling class of the United States and the American public followed right along.
 
After the Underwear Bombing, we saw the rollout of the TSA full-body scanners, a technology which would not have been readily accepted prior to the incident and subsequent propaganda campaign. However, the scanners had been purchased one year earlier by a firm owned by Michael Chertoff, the former head of Homeland Security.
 
Likewise, in terms of the LAX shooting, TSA purchased 3.5 million dollars worth of ammunition in August. Yet, in August, TSA was not an armed agency. After the LAX shooting, however, talk has turned to arming the agency, thus indicating possible foreknowledge on the part of someone higher up in the governmental structure.
 
Of course, the same can be said for the explosion of crazed lone-gunman shooting sprees that took place all across the United States amid propaganda pushes for increased gun control measures.
 
5. Unanswered Questions: Another hallmark of the false flag operation is relatively obvious – the presence of unanswered questions regarding the details of the attack, the perpetrators, the motive and so on. Although the media narrative that takes shape soon after the attack will ignore these questions, they will inevitably remain if observers are able to think for themselves and focus only on the information. An example of such questions would be Building 7 on 9/11 or the questions of additional shooters at Aurora and Sandy Hook.
 
6. Case is quickly closed: Once an acceptable patsy and cover story is chosen by the media, all other opinions and questions are refused air time. Nothing that even slightly contradicts the official story is acknowledged as legitimate. Once this happens, the patsy, if still alive (in rare circumstances) is charged, prosecuted, and convicted in a largely secret or shadowy proceeding. In most cases, the suspect is killed in the process or shortly after the fact thus negating any first hand contradiction of the official narrative. Either way, the case is closed very soon after the event.
 
7. Suspects’ Connection to CIA, FBI, or Other Intelligence Agencies: One key aspect suggesting a false flag that should be looked for soon after the attack is any possible connection the suspect or group of suspects may have had with intelligence agencies. A connection to any one of these organizations and institutions may go some length in explaining how the attack was coordinated, the motivation of the perpetrators, the actual involvement (or not) of the suspects, and who actually directed the operation. For instance, on 9/11, many of the alleged hijackers had previously had close contact with the FBI, CIA, and other high-level intelligence agencies (both home and abroad).[5] Likewise, the Tsarnaev brothers who have been accused of masterminding and carrying out the Boston Bombing had ties to the FBI before the attack.
 
In many instances, connections to certain military agencies and communities should serve as the same red flag as connections to intelligence agencies since these institutions have largely been blended together.
 
8. Convenient Scapegoat: One clue leading an informed observer to suspect a false flag attack is the existence of the convenient scapegoat. Any false flag operation will have a carefully crafted narrative complete with a group of individuals set up for demonization. The OKC bombing had McVeigh and thus, “right-wing extremists” and “militias.” On 9/11, the group was Muslims. In many of the domestic shooting sprees, the demonization was set for gun owners. With the recent LAX shooting, the “perpetrator” was an “anti-government conspiracy theorist.” In the instance of the false flag, a readily identified pasty will exhibit all or most of the aspects of the group and social demographic set to be demonized.
 
9. Media Promotes A Narrative Against Scapegoat Groups and/or An Agenda To Take Liberties: One clue suggesting a false flag is that, immediately after the attack and after the perpetrators have been “identified” by “officials” and the media, corporate media outlets begin not only demonizing the demographic group to which the “perpetrator” belongs, but begins promoting “solutions” in order to prevent such an attack from ever happening again. This narrative will always involve the erosion of liberties, the greater implementation of a police state, a specific economic policy, or a march to war.
 
Simply put, the media promotes the PROBLEM, allows for and guides the REACTION, and then provides the pre-determined SOLUTION.

10. Government Begins to “Take Action” Against the Scapegoat or Moves Along the Lines of the Media Narrative: After a healthy dose of propaganda from mainstream media outlets regurgitating the terror of the attack, the perpetrator, and the police state solutions, the Government then begins to take action. Political speeches are given in order to capitalize on the fear and anger felt by the public and in order to reinforce the idea that government is there to act as protector. Political solutions are then offered as bills, executive orders, or political mandates whether it is the curtailment of the 4th Amendment, gun control, or military strikes on a foreign country.
 
11. Clues in pop media: Pop media clues, more accurately described as predictive programming, is more easily identified in hindsight. This often involves the portrayal of the very incident occurring in a movie or television show. In other instances, it may involve the conspicuous or even inconspicuous placement of random details of the attack into movies and television. For instance, The Lone Gunman, a short-lived spinoff of the X-Files carried a storyline in which a passenger plane was hijacked via remote control and was being flown into the World Trade Center towers. In The Dark Knight Rises, a very curious reference was made to Sandy Hook with a map of Newtown, Connecticut on the wall.
 
Conclusion
 
Although it is extremely important to educate the general public as to the nature and purpose of false flags, education cannot be a goal in and of itself. The public not only needs to know the truth surrounding specific false flag events as they appear, they need to understand the methodology of identifying them on their own and in real time.
 
Creating a culture in which the general public is able to recognize the false flag attack as it is happening, without the need for a massive push by alternative media sources, researchers, or activists, is the first step in not only rendering the tactic useless, but in corralling the force of the people toward true action or, at the very least, creating a culture in which that force cannot be corralled by the ruling class.
 
While false flag attacks must be addressed, we must not allow ourselves to be so easily diverted off a path of political action, mass mobilization, and the making of real attainable demands.

Japan to propose changes to beef import safeguards in talks with U.S.: sources,"A worker adjusts the U.S. flag before Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses media following a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 17, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will propose changes to its safeguard mechanism on frozen U.S. beef imports that will shorten review periods and allow importers to voluntarily lower import volumes to prevent tariffs from automatically kicking in, two government sources said on Thursday.
The proposal will be made at the second round of the U.S.-Japan economic dialogue in Washington on Oct. 16, but it is uncertain if the U.S. side will go along, said the two sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter.
If successful, the proposal could help ward off trade friction with the United States, which is renegotiating free trade agreements with other countries to protect jobs and lower its trade deficit.
Under current measures, Japan automatically imposes higher tariffs if quarterly imports of specific beef products from any country rise more than 17 percent from the previous year.
Japan hiked tariffs from Aug. 1 on imports of frozen beef, popular in beef bowl dishes, from countries including the United States to 50 percent from 38.5 percent.
The move followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdraw from the long-planned Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal earlier this year.
Japan says the tariff hike, set to be in place until next March, is a “safeguard” mechanism to protect domestic farmers, but it has prompted some concern in Washington.
Instead of reviewing import data on a quarterly basis, Japan will propose shortening this period to every 10 days, the sources said. This will make it easier for companies that import beef to adjust volumes and avoid triggering tariffs, the sources said.
However, the plan is far from certain to work because frozen U.S. beef imports could surge next year in April after the current tariff increase expires, one source said.
“Once the safeguard is triggered, there is a concern that it will repeatedly be triggered in the future,” the source said.
The first round of the U.S.-Japan economic dialogue, which was held in Tokyo in April, ended largely without incident. However, there is some concern among Japanese officials that the U.S. side could strongly push for trade concession during the second dialogue meeting.
Japan had a $69-billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, which has expressed concern over what it called the “persistence” of the imbalance.
Japanese officials counter that Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is much bigger."
China's secret aid empire uncovered,"Image copyright Paula Bronstein
China has a long list of state secrets - how many people it puts to death every year, and even the birthdays of its top leaders. But now, overseas researchers have uncovered another Chinese state secret: how much money Beijing gives in aid to other countries.
Not very long ago, China was a foreign aid recipient. Now, it rivals the United States as one of the world's largest donors, through traditional development aid or through financial loans.
For the first time, a large group of researchers outside China have compiled a major database detailing virtually all of China's financial money flow to recipient countries. Citing more than 5,000 projects found across 140 countries, it reveals that China and the US rival each other in terms of how much they offer to other countries.
However, ""they spend those budgets in radically different ways. And the different compositions of those portfolios have far-reaching consequences"", explains Brad Parks, the project's chief researcher.
He heads the AidData research lab at the College of William & Mary in Virginia, which teamed up with other researchers at Harvard University and the University of Heidelberg in Germany to complete the research.
How did they uncover the secret?
Image copyright CARL DE SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Pictured in 2015, Chinese workers build railway infrastructure to link Djibouti with Addis Ababa, in neighbouring Ethiopia
The AidData team had to develop its own methodology to answer the questions that weren't provided by the Chinese government. They tracked money flows from China to recipient countries using news reports, official embassy documents and aid and debt information from China's counterparts.
Piece by painstaking piece, the information came together to draw a relatively complete picture of where Chinese aid is going and what impact it's having.
""We think the methodology has revealed the known knowable universe,"" Brad Parks says. ""If the Chinese government really wants to conceal something, we won't necessarily pick it up."" But if there are sizeable money transfers going from China to a recipient country, ""word is going to get out"", he adds.
How does China hand out money?
One major finding from the study: China and the US, the world's biggest donor, have handed out similar amounts of money in the years covered in the database, but the countries distribute that money in radically different ways.
The vast majority (93%) of US financial aid fits under the traditional definition of aid that's agreed upon by all Western industrialised countries. That aid is given with the main goal of developing the economic development and welfare of recipient countries. At least a quarter of that money represents a direct grant, not a loan that needs to be repaid.
In contrast, only a small portion (21%) of the money that China gives to other countries can be considered as traditional aid. And the rest of that money? The ""lion's share"" of that money is given in commercial loans that have to be repaid to Beijing with interest.
""China wants to get attractive economic returns on its capital,"" Brad Parks explains.
And what does that money achieve?
The team's other major finding: when China gives out traditional aid, the recipient countries reap impressive economic rewards. For a long period, there were suspicions that Chinese aid projects were only set up to benefit China; infrastructure projects built by imported Chinese workers, for instance, that did little to improve the lives of people on the ground. However, this research shows that China is just as capable of managing development aid projects as Western donors.
Chinese aid: How they spend it $362bn total Chinese foreign aid and loans 21% of China's aid spending is on grants - the rest is loans
$399bn is the total for US foreign aid and loans in the same period
93% of the US total is traditional aid, focused on economic development and welfare Getty
Which countries are getting China's money?
Since 2000, African countries have captured a large slice of the aid and loans given by China.
However, China's wealth is distributed to points across the globe, from hospitals in Senegal to ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In 2014, the most recent year covered by AidData, Russia topped the recipient list, followed by Pakistan and Nigeria.
In contrast, the US list in 2014 was topped by Iraq and Afghanistan, followed by Pakistan.

Politics plays a big part in how both China and the US decide to spend their money. Earlier studies by the researchers behind AidData show that both Beijing and Washington tend to offer money to countries which support them at the United Nations.
But for China, economics play a key role: the AidData researchers found Beijing is often focused on promoting Chinese exports or market rate loans where China wants to get the loan repaid with interest.
The North Korea factor
China is often cited as the main source of aid propping up the fragile North Korean economy. But the AidData researchers tracked down just 17 Chinese projects in North Korea over the 14-year period, totalling a measly $210m.
Brad Parks calls North Korea ""an informational black hole"", admitting that it's the only recipient country that truly evaded the researchers. To a large extent, the vast amounts of money and other kinds of aid that China is believed to give North Korea fall outside the global financial system.

Why is China's money so attractive?
In the 1960s to the 1990s, Western countries offered high-interest market-rate loans to developing countries. However, that strategy misfired when recipient countries could not begin to repay the interest on the debts they had acquired. Outrage ensued and the Western aid model was overhauled.
""There was a shared principle that we should not be offering market-rate loans to developing countries,"" Brad Parks says. ""And now, here comes China, enter stage left. They're not part of that coalition. They haven't been socialised to that principle and they're very willing and able to provide loans near or at market rate.
""Increasingly, countries that don't want to go the IMF for a bailout when they're in trouble, they will go to China instead.""
Will China continue to loan out money?
So far, the data shows that the countries that receive China's market-rate loans are not suffering economically, but they aren't experiencing economic growth either. Researchers fear that could change in 10 or 15 years, when countries build up debts because they can't repay the money they will owe to Beijing. At that point, China might have to rethink things.
""They may very well 10 years from now, or 15 years from now, encounter the same problems that Western donors and creditors encountered when loans are not getting repaid,"" Brad Parks explains. ""If and when that point of reckoning occurs, then perhaps Beijing will revisit how it structures these loans.""
Already, researchers have uncovered signs that China's starting to shift its approach to lending, researcher Xiaojun Li from the University of British Columbia says. Increasingly, Beijing is lending through multilateral institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, China's answer to the World Bank.
Why does it matter if China becomes a big global lender?
There is evidence that China's no-strings loans have had an effect on the entire global lending system, forcing traditional donors to stop placing so many requirements on receiving countries. Using AidData's database, economist Diego Hernandez revealed that China's role as a major lender has boosted competition between traditional donors.
""When an African country is also assisted by China,"" he writes, ""the World Bank provides fewer conditions attached to its loans"". For every 1% increase in Chinese aid, Hernandez found the World Bank lessened its typical demands for things like market liberalisation or economic transparency by 15%.
Critics have long charged that ""rogue aid"" from China allows some countries to avoid democratic reforms because they can simply turn to China for aid, dodging the scrutiny of traditional Western donors.
Cambodia is a recent example; independent newspapers and western NGOs have been shuttered, as Cambodian leaders' strengthening ties with China embolden them to turn away from Washington's demands to hold fair elections.
Xiaojun Li studied how Chinese aid has changed countries in Africa, arguing that democratic reforms have slowed as the developing countries concluded they could bypass the political demands of Western donors by turning to Chinese aid.
""Traditional donors have criticised China's approach to aid,"" he says, but ""many African countries embrace the assistance from Beijing, or at least are glad to have more options""."
"Kirstjen Nielsen, White House Aide, Is Picked to Run Homeland Security","Former colleagues said on Wednesday that Ms. Nielsen was well qualified.
“She’s a total homeland security expert — absolutely has no learning curve,” said Michael Allen, who worked with Ms. Nielsen during the Bush administration. “She’s an experienced manager, she’s an implementer, she knows how to get under the hood and figure out what needs to be connected to what.”
Added Frances Townsend, her boss at the White House during the Bush administration: “She is tough as nails, competent and has rightly earned the president’s respect.”

Mr. Kelly and Ms. Nielsen arrived at the White House after a tumultuous period that led to the departure of Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s first chief of staff, and Sean Spicer, his original press secretary. Mr. Kelly, who spends much of his time managing the president and working to defuse brewing confrontations between Mr. Trump and senior advisers, has leaned on Ms. Nielsen to manage and impose discipline on the rest of the White House staff.
It is not clear who will play that role after she leaves, and her departure will leave a hole at the White House as Mr. Trump faces an array of challenges, including confronting the threat from North Korea, addressing ruptures with his cabinet and crucial Republican lawmakers and trying to push a large tax cut through Congress.
Ms. Nielsen’s experience at the Homeland Security department began after the Sept. 11 attacks, when she joined the newly formed Transportation Security Administration, housed within the department. She also served on Mr. Bush’s homeland security council, devising a national response plan for domestic incidents and helping to compile a report on lessons from the bungled federal response to Hurricane Katrina.
As a private-sector consultant, she helped government entities and private companies devise preparedness plans to guard against cyberattacks.
Tom Ridge, who served under Mr. Bush as the nation’s first homeland security secretary, called Ms. Nielsen “extremely well versed in the all-hazard threats challenging the security and resilience of our homeland.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
“Most importantly, in this hyper-political environment, Kirstjen is not a self-promoter,” Mr. Ridge said in a statement. “She is a patriot and takes a mission-focused approach to her work.”
Some Democrats, however, expressed reservations about Ms. Nielsen’s extensive résumé, and her closeness to the president and his chief of staff.
“I am very concerned about her past work in the Bush administration during its botched response to Hurricane Katrina and am fearful that D.H.S. — as well as this president — has not learned all the lessons from that tragedy given what we are seeing unravel in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, referring to the federal response to hurricane damage on those islands, which has been widely criticized.
“It is extremely important that the D.H.S. secretary stay above the partisan fray,” Mr. Thompson added, “and not allow the position be a political pawn of the White House.”"
India's IOC buys new U.S. crude grades for December delivery: sources,"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Indian Oil is seen on the shirt of an employee at a fuel station in New Delhi, India August 29, 2016. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp, the country’s largest refiner, has bought two new types of U.S. crude for December delivery as it tests different grades from the United States, trade sources said on Tuesday.
IOC bought 1 million barrels each of U.S. Southern Green Canyon (SGC) and WTI Midland crude likely from a Chinese trader, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The purchase was in addition to 2 million barrels of Basra Light crude to be delivered in the same month.
The United States has become a new source of crude supply for Asia since Washington lifted a ban on crude exports in late 2015. India joined other Asian countries in buying U.S. crude in the fourth quarter to widen its import sources as well as to reduce trade surplus with the United States.
IOC has issued another sour crude tender that will close later this week to purchase more oil for the same period, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.
Officials at IOC weren’t available for comment.
The refiner has bought about 5.5 million barrels of U.S. crude so far this year.
Other Indian refiners to have bought U.S. crude include Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd, Bharat Oman Refinery, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd."
Oil rises 2 percent on signs rebalancing underway,"A oil pump is seen at sunset outside Scheibenhard, near Strasbourg, France, October 6, 2017 . REUTERS/Christian Hartmann
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent on Tuesday, supported by Saudi Arabian export cuts in November and comments from OPEC and trading companies that the market is rebalancing after years of oversupply.
Saudi Arabia has cut November allocations by 560,000 barrels per day (bpd), in line with its commitment to an OPEC-led supply reduction pact.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is seeking to hold a second meeting with U.S. independent oil firms as well as hedge funds, OPEC’s Secretary General told Reuters, adding that no oil producer could afford to live in isolation.
Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 82 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $56.61 a barrel while U.S. crude rose $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $50.92.
From a technical standpoint, U.S. crude has staged an impressive rebound from the $49.08 level and a decisive breakout above $51 should encourage a further incline towards $52.40 a barrel, said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM.
“In an alternative scenario, sustained weakness below $49, which is also under the 50 (day) daily simple moving average, may open a path towards $47.80.”
OPEC, Russia and other non-member producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until next March to get rid of a price-sapping supply glut.
The group is increasingly confident that the market is rebalancing fast, helped by the cutback as well as by stronger-than-expected growth in global demand.
The deal is working, keeping oil prices within “a reasonable range”, the RIA news agency cited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev as saying.
The chief executive of trading firm Gunvor, Torbjorn Tornqvist, also said the market was rebalancing, citing falling product stocks and crude held in floating storage clearing up.
“We don’t see this market being out of balance one way or another,” he told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit taking place this week. Overall crude stocks “are still high,” he added, and OPEC needed to stick to its output curbs.
Short-term price support was coming from the United States, where 85 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production, or 1.49 million bpd, was offline following Hurricane Nate, according to official figures. However, many facilities have begun resuming operations.
Long term, U.S. oil output could be set for a last spike in 2018 before growth flattens for a number of years as rising costs make a big chunk of production uneconomic, the head of top oil trader Vitol, Ian Taylor, told Reuters.
A federal holiday on Monday has delayed the release of the weekly U.S. inventory data by a day. The American Petroleum Institute (API) is scheduled to release its data for last week at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Wednesday and the U.S. Department of Energy’s report is due at 11 a.m. EDT on Thursday.
U.S. crude inventories probably fell for a third straight week, while refined product stockpiles also likely declined, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
OPEC has managed record-high adherence to its supply cutting deal this year and is considering extending the deal beyond its March 2018 expiry. Some analysts have been concerned that a price recovery could tempt producers to open the taps again.
But analysts at JPMorgan said this was less of an issue, saying “concerns that OPEC compliance would fade into the fourth quarter now appear unfounded.”
“Stronger-than-assumed economic growth offers the potential for tight market conditions to continue if OPEC extends the current deal for another nine months,” the bank said."
"10 Important Stories From 09/26/17 Box Scores: Montgomery’s Strong Start, Harper’s Return & More","10 Important Stories From 09/26/17 Box Scores: Montgomery’s Strong Start, Harper’s Return & More
(Before It's News)
by Ray Kuhn
We had a busy Tuesday across baseball as the 2017 winds down. Whether you are making that final push towards a championship, getting ready for next season, or getting those last few days of DFS in, we have you covered. Let’s take a look at some of the performances that stood out from last night:
1) Hernandez Shows off the Power…
September is all about young players taking advantage of their chance. The trade from Houston gave Teoscar Hernandez that chance, and he is working towards a 2018 role with the Blue Jays. Batting lead-off, Hernandez went deep twice. His first home run was a solo shot off Chris Sale, and then followed it up with a three run blast. The problem though, is that in his other three at bats, Hernandez struck out. In 73 at bats with Toronto this season, Hernandez has seven home runs and 18 RBI while batting .274. His BABIP is .317, and it is very possible he holds onto his role for next season.
2) Cutch Has a Game…
We are past the point now of wondering if Andrew McCutchen is truly done or not, but last night ensured he is ending the season strong. Not only did the outfielder go 4 for 4 on Tuesday, but he went deep twice. His two home runs, a grand slam and a three run shot, gave him 28 on the season, and all together, the outfielder picked up 8 RBI on the night. That leaves McCutchen with 87 RBI on the season along with a .278 batting average. Sure there will lots of younger, more exciting and potential filled options on draft day, and you have to keep McCutchen’s early season struggles in mind, but he still has something to offer.
3) Montgomery Has a Strong Outing…
If your streaming carousel brought you to Jordan Montgomery last night, then you should be pleased. The rookie picked up his ninth victory of the season at home against Tampa Bay with six strong innings. Montgomery held the Rays to just one run in six innings of work on six hits and a walk. He struck out five while bringing his ERA down to 3.96 for the season. The Yankees’ plan for Montgomery next season will likely depend on how their off-season goes, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see him back in their rotation on a full time basis. He could prove to be a valuable mid, or back end of the rotation option if that is the case.
4) Rosario Continues to Slug…
Everyone is going to talk about Byron Buxton and Miguel Sano (before he got hurt), but there are more young players on the Twins who do require your attention. One of those players, is Eddie Rosario. The outfielder has been having a solid year, but when Sano went down, Rosario truly has stepped up. He went deep in the first inning last night, and followed that up with three more hits. After picking up 27th home run of the season, Rosario doubled twice (33 overall) and drove in two more runs. That brought his RBI total up to 78 to go along with his .292 batting average.
5) What Will Happen With Hader Next Year…
We know that Josh Hader was, maybe even still is, a top pitching prospect. The Brewers have given him a chance to start at the Triple-A level, but for multiple reasons, the southpaw has struggled and produced ERA’s north of five. Part of that reason, is that Milwaukee’s Triple-A team is in Colorado Springs so elevation is certainly an issue. However, the Brewers brought Hader to the major leagues this season to work out of the bullpen, and all he has done in his 34 outings is dominate. Last night, Hader picked up his second victory of the season with 2.2 innings of two run ball. In fact, all things considered this was one of his worst outings since he gave up two runs, but he did strikeout six as he saw his ERA jump to 1.93. Hader clearly can pitch at the big league level and get batters out, so it wouldn’t surprise me to see Milwaukee try him as a starter this spring. If not, we know he has value out of the bullpen.
6) Maybin Drives in Three…
The Astros didn’t get Cameron Maybin to sit on the bench, and while hitting for average has been a struggle this season, he is still a productive option. After his two hit night on Tuesday, Maybin is hitting just .225 on the season, but his .270 BABIP (career mark of .316) says this is on the lower scale of what we can expect from him. Maybin’s pop was on display last night, as he hit a traditional home run, a three run shot, and also as he he a triple to dead center field and scored on an error. In 386 at bats this season, Maybin has 10 home runs 34 RBI, and 33 stolen bases. In other words, he gives you just enough to keep you hooked from a fantasy perspective on his tools.
7) Harper Returns…
As far as fantasy owners are considered, this is too little, too late. Bryce Harper isn’t back to give their fantasy teams a push in the final week of the season. Instead, Harper is back to get a few games and at bats in before the playoffs. The good thing though, is that we are going to get proof that Harper is healthy and recovered from his injury prior to next season. In reality, Harper’s injury looked worse than it was, but it was still a good thing to see the outfielder back on the field. In three at bats prior to being replaced, Harper went 0 for 2 with a walk and a strikeout. Check the lineup each day before starting him, as Washington will be careful.
8) Anderson Shuts Out Miami…
After struggling and missing a chunk of the season, Tyler Anderson is back, and last night showed why there was some buzz surrounding the southpaw this season. Now that outlook is always going to be clouded by the fact that Anderson does pitch at Coors Field, but early in his career, he has shown some potential. Last night, Anderson shut the Marlins out over seven innings of work while allowing just four hits and striking out five. On the season, Anderson’s ERA is 4.81 in 17 games (15 starts). Anderson made his fourth start since returning for the disabled list on Tuesday, and in that stretch, he has a 1.19 ERA along with a 0.79 WHIP. In two starts in Coors Field since his return, Anderson has thrown 13 shutout innings, and he is worth a look.
9) Another One for JD…
This is getting to be insane. Originally acquired to protect Paul Goldschmidt in the batting order, J.D. Martinez is taking control of things for Arizona’s offense. All Martinez did last night, was pick up three hits in four at bats. He was a triple short of the cycle, and Martinez’s night included his 44th home run of the season, which happened to be a grand slam. Martinez drove in six runs on the night which brought his total for the season to 103 as he raised his batting average to .304. Arizona certainly has agreed with Martinez, and it will be interesting to see where he ends up this off-season.
10) Seager Drives in Four…
It hasn’t been an easy September for the Dodgers as they came crashing back to earth. Corey Seager has battled an elbow injury, but it didn’t appear to impact him at the plate on Tuesday. The shortstop went deep for the 21st time this season, a three run shot, and he later added an RBI single (75 for the season). While Seager is having a solid season, some would consider his overall numbers a disappointment; although he is batting .295. It was a good sign to see Seager’s success last night, as he is hitting just .195 in 68 at bats so far in September. It is possible, that Seager might be a “value” pick for 2018 since he didn’t take as big a step forward as other young players; such as Francisco Lindor.

Las Vegas massacre: How a stranger saved a woman's life,"(CNN) On Sunday night in Las Vegas, amid chaos and under a hail of bullets, Justin Uhart met Jan Lambourne.
They will probably never forget each other.
Both were at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when a gunman opened fire from a hotel room across the street, killing 58 people. Now Lambourne is recovering from a gunshot wound in a Las Vegas hospital, while Uhart is being hailed as a hero.
""He was amazing. The last time I seen him was when they took me in for surgery,"" Lambourne told CNN partner CBC , fighting through tears. ""He saved my life.""
Justin Uhart refused to leave Jan Lambourne's side until she was in surgery.
'This is real! get out!'
Uhart, 26, told CNN he was working the festival as a bartender to make some extra cash when the gunfire started.
Like many others, he took off running towards the stage, thinking there was a shooter in the crowd. A stunned man in a cowboy hat stared at him blankly, his eyes asking, ""What do I do?""
""Get the f--- out and run!,"" Uhart screamed, his Air Force ROTC training taking over. ""This is real! Get out!""
Uhart spied a girl moving on the ground and ran to help her. But it was too late.
""It was her just convulsing and twitching,"" he said. ""She was just dead.""
As he took cover near a control panel, a security guard collapsed on top of him with a bullet wound to the head.
The bullets kept coming.
'I love you. I've been shot'
Lambourne was visiting from Teulon, Manitoba, a small Canadian town near Winnipeg. It was the final show of the three-day concert on the Las Vegas Strip, and she remembers it as a beautiful night.
Then suddenly she heard a popping sound.
""I don't know if that's fireworks,"" Lambourne told her friend, Jody Ansell.
""Next thing I knew, I took a shot,"" she told CBC from her hospital bed. ""I felt it.""
As she learned later, the bullet tore through her abdomen and intestines, shattering her pelvic bone.
Lambourne crumpled to the ground, staring at the blood beginning to rush out. She became separated from her friend, who was shot in the arm but survived, according to CBC
Then she began crawling through the grass, trying to find safety.
Fearing she was vulnerable in the open, Lambourne staggered towards a tent and hid under an overturned wheelbarrow. She remembered she was carrying a bag of souvenir concert T-shirts and pressed them against her wound to try and slow the bleeding.
And she texted her husband.
""I love you. I've been shot. I love [you] so much,"" she told him.
'I'm not going to leave you'
Running again for cover, Justin Uhart spied a crumpled body screaming for help. With bullets still whizzing all around, he ran towards her.
It was Jan.
She was writhing in pain and bleeding out. He applied pressure to her wound, knowing the situation was dire.
Asked later what made him run towards Lambourne, despite the gunfire surrounding them both, Uhart didn't really know.
""You can't just run away,"" he said. ""I had to help. I had to do something.""
Her eyes were filled with terror and tears, ""looking at me like, 'Help me,"" he recalled. ""I was doing everything I could. I didn't know what else to do.""
The two exchanged names.
""Hey, hey, relax,"" Uhart told her. ""Look at me. I'm here. I'm not going to leave you.""
He called for help. Another man appeared and the two of them carried Lambourne to a paramedic mustering area, surrounded by screams and the sounds of bullets ricocheting around them.
Uhart kept talking to Lambourne the entire time, trying to calm her. They joked about how they were going to grab drinks later that night and talked about her cats.
A man came up and tore Uhart's shirt to help stop other victims' bleeding.
Paramedics loaded Lambourne into an ambulance. Although it was full with shooting victims, Uhart climbed in too, keeping pressure on Lambourne's gunshot wound.
He had to get in the ambulance. He was the only thing keeping Jan alive.
""I'm not going to leave you,"" he told her again. ""I'm here.""
'Your wife, Jan -- she's been hit'
In the ambulance Uhart also met a distraught young man whose his hip had been shattered by a bullet. Uhart nicknamed him ""California kid"" and started talking to him as well, trying anything and everything to calm him.
They arrived at Valley Hospital Medical Center, which brought a new scene of carnage: gurneys with patients, rattling past across the blood-stained floor.
Uhart kept up a running dialogue with Lambourne and ""California kid"" -- talking to them both about the ""stupidest"" things -- to keep them from freaking out.
""The doctors and nurses were telling me, 'Just keep talking. Just keep talking.'""
He pressed a damp paper towel against Lambourne's lips. She couldn't drink water because she was going into surgery.
Then Lambourne handed Uhart her phone. She asked him to call her husband, Joseph, and tell him what was happening.
Uhart dialed the number. A man answered.
""Joseph, this is Justin,"" he said as calmly as he could. ""There was a shooting in Vegas. Your wife, Jan -- she's been hit. She's alright and she's at the hospital now.""
Uhart answered as many questions as he could, then called the family of ""California kid"" and went through the same thing.
By then, Lambourne's situation was critical. Her left side was swelling from the internal bleeding and she needed to get into surgery immediately.
It was the only time, Uhart said, he really feared she was going to die.
Uhart went with her to the operating room, but a surgeon stopped him at the door.
""You can't come in here,"" the doctor said.
For the first time since Uhart rescued Lambourne three hours earlier from a bloody field, he let go of her.
'You can't wash it off'
Realizing he had left his wallet, keys and phone back at the concert grounds, Uhart got a ride to the house of a family friend.
He got out of the car and approached the gated community's guardhouse, his clothes stained with blood. The guard looked him up and down and said, ""I can't let you in.""
But Uhart, figuring he'd been through enough that night already, ignored him and jumped the fence.
He ran a mile to the friends' house and called his parents to let them know he was okay.
Then he took a shower and tried to grapple with everything he had seen.
""What the f--- happened?"" he asked himself, over and over. Even as the blood rinsed off, he didn't feel clean.
""That won't go away,"" he said later, his voice growing quiet. ""You can't wash it off.""
Days later, gunshots, blood and dead bodies continue to flash through Uhart's mind, especially when he tries to sleep.
""I haven't been able to sleep very much,"" he said. ""I was throwing up. I think it all kind of hit me.""
And he kept thinking about Jan, hoping she had survived the surgery.
Then came a Facebook notification: ""Jan Lambourne sent you a friend request.""
Relief washed over him. She had survived.
As of Wednesday morning, he didn't have any further details about ""California kid."""

Chicago Cubs clinch NL Central Division Title,"Chicago Cubs clinch NL Central Division Title
(Before It's News)
The National League Central Division race is officially over. For the second-straight season, the Chicago Cubs are champions of the NL Central after beating the St. Louis Cardinals 5-1 on Wednesday night. It was a struggle early on for the Cubs offense as pitcher Michael Wacha was dealing for the Cardinals. The pitcher was locked in until the 7th inning when the Cubs struck. Trailing 1-0, Anthony Rizzo led off the inning with a single and advanced to third on a single from Ben Zobrist. But the big blow came from the next hitter Addison Russell. Russell hit a long home run to left field, giving the Cubs a 3-0 lead and a positive sign in his offense:
.@Addison_Russell and the @Cubs want to celebrate tonight. pic.twitter.com/dmzXhlObWL — MLB (@MLB) September 28, 2017
The Cubs would add on two more runs in the inning to make it 5-1. Chicago’s bullpen got out of a big jam in the eighth inning when Carl Edwards Jr. got Dexter Fowler to pop out with the bases loaded and two outs. Starter John Lackey was dealing, throwing six innings while giving up just two hits and one run. He’s been pitching his best baseball of the season as of late, a good sign for the Cubs. Chicago then celebrated in the locker room, clinching the division title with a win this year.

California’s Bullet Button Ban Has Only Led to More Featureless Rifles,"California’s Bullet Button Ban Has Only Led to More Featureless Rifles
(Before It's News)

By Sam Bocetta
California has long been one of the states with the strictest gun laws, and in 1989, it became the first state to implement an assault weapons ban. That eventually led to the creation of the bullet button, a device that allowed Californians to own modified versions of rifles that the state considered an assault weapon, including the popular AR-15. In July of 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed several bills that expanded the state’s gun control laws, with SB 880/AB 1135 addressing the bullet button. That hasn’t stopped California’s large population of gun enthusiasts from coming up with new ways around those expanded laws. How Bullet Buttons Followed California’s Assault Weapons Laws When California set up its assault weapon laws, it included specific features for a rifle to be considered an assault weapon. The rifle would need to have a removable magazine along with any of these features: A flash suppressor A pistol grip A forward pistol grip An adjustable/collapsible stock The above features are common with AR-15s and many other rifles. Gun owners and manufacturers in California found a solution with the bullet button. This is a device that gets installed on the gun’s magazine release. A traditional magazine release …

Harvey Weinstein: Wife Georgina Chapman leaves accused producer,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Chapman, pictured here with her husband, said his actions were ""unforgivable""
The wife of producer Harvey Weinstein has said she is leaving him following allegations of sexual harassment from a string of actresses.
Georgina Chapman, 41, described Weinstein's actions as ""unforgivable"".
Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow are the latest women to come forward. Both said the incidents happened early in their careers.
On Tuesday, Weinstein also denied allegations of rape made in The New Yorker magazine.
Weinstein was fired on Sunday from his own film studio. The Weinstein Company board said on Tuesday that they would help any criminal investigation.
""My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,"" Georgina Chapman, 41, told People magazine.
Chapman and Weinstein, 65, have two children together.
In a statement, the film mogul said: ""?I support her decision, I am in counselling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild.""

Meanwhile, former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle have joined the growing public condemnation.
In a statement, they said they were ""disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein"" and added that they ""celebrate the courage of women who have come forward"".
Weinstein was a big donor to the Democratic party under Obama's leadership. The Obamas' eldest daughter Malia worked as an intern at The Weinstein Company in New York earlier this year.
Weinstein also donated to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Mrs Clinton said she was ""shocked and appalled"" by the revelations.

Paltrow and Jolie both sent statements about Weinstein's behaviour to the New York Times, which first reported allegations against him last week.
Jolie said in an email: ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did.
""This behaviour towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable.""
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gwyneth Paltrow said she was ""terrified"" when Weinstein made advances on her
In a statement, Paltrow alleged that, after Weinstein cast her in the leading role in Emma, he summoned her to his hotel suite, where he placed his hands on her and suggested massages in his bedroom.
""I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,"" she told the newspaper.
She said she told her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt about the incident, and said he confronted Weinstein.
""I thought he was going to fire me,"" she said.

California wildfires: Calistoga evacuated amid blazes,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption California districts wiped out by wildfires
California officials have ordered an entire town to evacuate as ""conditions have worsened"" in wildfires that have now killed 26 people.
All residents of Calistoga were directed to leave the area on Wednesday night, Napa County officials said.
About 60 prison inmates have joined hard-pressed firefighters in battling the fast-moving blazes, the state fire chief says.
Among the areas scorched by the 22 blazes are marijuana farms.
'Explosive vegetation'
On Thursday morning, Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano said 463 people are still unaccounted for.
Nine hundred people have been reported missing since the fire started on Sunday night, but a large number have been located, he added.
The night before, all 5,000 residents of Calistoga, in Napa County, were told to leave as police blocked traffic from approaching the area.
Geyserville, a town of around 800 people, and the community of Boyes Hot Springs, both in Sonoma, were also evacuated.
""It's going to continue to get worse before it gets better,"" state fire Chief Ken Pimlott said.
He warned that the death toll could rise further.
""We are still impacted by five years of drought,"" he added.
""These fires were driven by the critically dry fuel bed. We are literally looking at explosive vegetation.""
The wildfires, fanned by 50mph (80km/h) wind gusts, have razed more than 3,500 buildings and homes spanning 170,000 acres (68,800 hectares).
Interactive Slide the button to see how a Santa Rosa community was devastated After Before
Renewed high winds are fanning the ""catastrophic"" blazes, said state fire officials, which were spreading unpredictably in their fourth day.
Firefighters are going door to door in the state's wine-producing region, evacuating those left behind ahead of the next wave of blazes.
Some homeowners complained that the flames had reached their doors ahead of any official warnings.
Many residents did not receive notifications on their mobile phones, similar to the Amber Alert issued for missing children.
Sheriff Giordano said Sonoma County uses a system that requires sign-up to receive such messages.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The fires are spreading
The wildfires have damaged or demolished at least 13 Napa Valley wineries, a vintners' trade group says.
Cannabis plantations in fire-scorched Mendocino County could lose millions as many are uninsured, according to Nikki Lastreto of the local industry association.
Marijuana farmers cannot insure their businesses since federal law bans the drug.
Though recreational cannabis was legalised in the state in 2016, California's retail market does not open until next January.
Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Entire neighbourhoods in the town of Santa Rosa have been destroyed
This means some farmers who have invested millions may be left without a business once the smoke clears.
The fires are among the deadliest in California's history and have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, about 50 miles away.
More than 200 fire engines and crews are being rushed to California from the rest of the US, officials said.
Mr Pimlott said 73 helicopters, 30 air tankers and nearly 8,000 firefighters were currently battling the blazes.

The conflagration has reduced entire neighbourhoods in the city of Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 people, to ash.
Fourteen of the deaths have occurred in Sonoma County, officials say.
Some 25,000 people across the county have been evacuated and 40,000 homes are without power.
Six people have died in Mendocino County, four in Yuba County and two in Napa County, officials said."

Astronomers Wonder How Many Hybrids Are Out There
 
 
Astronomers have found not just one, but two, swirling around each other in a cosmic dance and leaving behind a stream of dust as they go. It is certainly a beautiful example of nature and it does bring about questions that are very interesting concerning just how many hybrids there might be out there.
 
As part of the Spacewatch program, the binary object was seen first in 2006 and it was given the rather unassuming name of 2006 VW139. However, in 2012 astronomers found that there was something strange about it as the asteroid had characteristics that were comet-like, with one giveaway being the tail that was streaming behind it.

There is nothing new about main-belt comets. However, they are not common either. The asteroid is only one of a dozen objects to have ever been found and what makes this one standout is the fact that it is in two pieces.
 
2006 VW139 is made from two lumps of equal size that are orbiting each other at about 60 miles distance but why it split in half is something of a mystery and left astronomers wanting to take an even closer look. When the twins came closer to the Sun in September last year, NASA made the Hubble Space Telescope capture images that were clearer of the tail and the nucleus and this confirmed signatures of a comet sitting where they do not usually sit.

Jessica Agarwal from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany said that they had found indications that were strong for sublimation of water ice thanks to an increase in solar heating, very much in the same way as the comet's tail is created. Researchers believe that 2006 VW139 split apart around 5000 years ago thanks to stress rotation, where a stream of vapor coming off them helped them to move more and more apart.
 
There is still one question that remains, and this is how common systems such as this are actually in the inner Solar System. Agarwal said that more observational and theoretical work is needed along with the sighting of more objects similar to this one to be able to find an answer to the question. It is hoped that more of the oddball icy asteroids will be seen with technology making advancements, to reveal a great deal more of the beauty along with detail in the rock-studded asteroid belt.

Pharma's Puerto Rico problems could mean drug shortages: FDA chief,"U.S. Food and Drug Commissioner Scott Gottlieb attends an interview at Reuters headquarters in New York City, U.S., October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday the country may start to see a small number of drug shortages within two or three weeks due to delays in restoring manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico, where 10 percent of drugs prescribed in the United States are made.
Hurricane Maria slammed into the Caribbean island on Sept. 20, knocking out electricity and causing widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. Almost three weeks later, just 16 percent of electricity service has been restored to the U.S. territory.
Drugmakers are working to get facilities fully online, but face an uncertain power supply and difficulty obtaining materials used in the manufacturing process.
“A lot of companies say they’re online, but they basically have one of five lines running at 20 percent or 80 percent or 50 percent,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told Reuters in an interview in New York. “They are not manufacturing at full capacity. They are manufacturing well short of that.”
“It’s unclear when they are going to be able to bring that up to full capacity,” he said.
Asked when U.S. hospitals and pharmacies might see shortages as a result, he said: “You might see some in the next two or three weeks if there’s going to be additional shortages coming out of this situation.”
The FDA has warned of 40 drugs made in Puerto Rico that could face shortages, including treatments for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and HIV, but has not named specific medicines.
Most major drug companies have manufacturing facilities on the island, including Merck & Co, Johnson and Johnson, Amgen Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Eli Lilly and Co, Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca and GSK

The FDA leader said he wants drugmakers to provide the public with more information about the extent of the problems they are facing. He said the plants were all relying on backup generators for electricity, some of which were not designed to operate for sustained periods of time.
“I‘m going to ask some of these companies to be a little more transparent around some of these issues,” he said, adding that improvements would likely come slowly, with potential setbacks along the way. “As time goes on, we’re going to see secondary impacts like the generators could start going down.”
Gottlieb said he was “troubleshooting for individual companies” on a daily basis and working with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to address issues such a fuel shortages and shipping problems that could stall operations.
Most of the companies contacted by Reuters said they are working to avoid product shortages.
Bristol-Myers said it has resumed limited operations to ship warehoused products. “As of today, no product supply impact is expected, however we continue to assess the challenging operational conditions on the island,” spokesman Ken Dominski said.
Amgen, in a statement, said it was “preparing to resume manufacturing in various plants over the next several weeks” and did not anticipate an impact on supply to patients.
Merck has one manufacturing facility on the island. “We have brought power back online via on-site generators that will allow most operations to proceed,” spokeswoman Claire Gillespie said.
Of the list of drugs being closely monitored by FDA, 14 medicines are sourced solely out of Puerto Rico, Gottlieb said.
He said the agency was working with drugmakers and would consider approving manufacturing sites in other countries, such as Mexico, Canada or Ireland, to alleviate possible shortages if companies have plants there."
UK Supermarket Becomes World's First to Offer Cashless Checkout with Finger Vein Scan,"By Nicholas West
The march toward a cashless society has now moved from the theoretical to the phase of widespread adoption. This is primarily due to developments in the tech sector that now enable the easy use of biometric recognition systems, as well as the increasing acceptance from a public who is becoming familiar with turning themselves into a password for their personal devices.
Behind the scenes, governments and corporations have been building the political and economic enticements via the Better Than Cash Alliance to ensure that the world eventually gets “de-cashed.” We’re now witnessing the full roll-out of an architecture that has been in development for many years.
China’s high-tech KFC recently made headlines when it began testing facial recognition payments in its KPRO store. Cashless agenda denialists, however, could readily point to China’s authoritarian government to ease any fears about an impending technocratic takeover occurring in the (supposedly) more democratic West.
Well, today’s cashless agenda news does come from the West, and it’s a world’s first. As reported by The Telegraph, London’s Costcutter supermarket has announced that its shoppers can now pay by finger vein scan.
It works by using infrared to scan people’s finger veins and then links this unique biometric map to their bank cards. Customers’ bank details are then stored with payment provider Worldpay, in the same way you can store your card details when shopping online. Shoppers can then turn up to the supermarket with nothing on them but their own hands and use it to make payments in just three seconds.
Nice and convenient, of course.
Longtime readers of Activist Post might remember an article by Brandon Turbeville written in 2011 warning that this was being tested as a future payment system. Remarking at the time about how smartphone payments would eventually seem outdated, he explained:
Taking the cashless control grid one step further, an article published on August 8, 2011 in Technology Review, entitled “Beyond Cell Phone Wallets, Biometrics Promise Truly Wallet-Free Future,” explains that major corporations are not even waiting for the “digital wallet” to catch on. They are actually moving forward with a system that will allow for an individual to swipe their palm, not their phone, in front of a digital recognition device in order to gain access to various buildings, pay for merchandise, or otherwise identify oneself. […] Indeed, this new type of technology, even this specific product, is already being introduced all over the United States. For instance, New York University’s Langone Medical Center has already implemented the vein scanners in some of its medical facilities. Manufactured by Fujitsu, the scanners are being placed in the hospital under the guise of greater convenience (the marketing gift that keeps on giving) and faster access to medical records. Health histories, insurance forms, and other documents are all handled electronically and at a much faster pace with the help of the new vein scanners. […] Schools, too, have begun to implement the Fujitsu systems. For instance, the Pinellas County School District in Florida recently announced that it was introducing the system in order “to identify students and thereby reduce waste and the threat of impersonation.” With the new scanners, the students are able to have their meals deducted from their account, upon scanning their palms, as they march single file in the feeding lines during lunch time. Of course, this type of technology is not new to Pinellas County. The students have been finger scanning in order to gain access to their lunch for years.
Naturally, these days not everyone is worried only about the intrusive nature of turning one’s body into a password to be mined by algorithms for corporations and governments, but just as legitimately about having their financial data hacked.
No worries, says the developer of the newest form of vein scanning, Sthaler. Although company director, Simon Binns, manages to sound creepy and objectifying even while trying to reassure the vein-scanning public:
FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) This is the safest form of biometrics. There are no known incidences where this security has been breached. “When you put your finger in the scanner it checks you are alive, it checks for a pulse, it checks for haemoglobin. ‘Your vein pattern is secure because it is kept on a database in an encrypted form, as binary numbers. No card details are stored with the retailer or ourselves, it is held with Worldpay, in the same way it is when you buy online.”
System developers are projecting that adoption of the technology will be rapid, with perhaps thousands of stores, nightclubs and membership services getting on board in the near future. The question is: Will it be optional? And if so, for how long?
As Brandon Turbeville concluded more than 6 years ago:
It should be noted that almost every element of any control grid begins by being optional when it is first introduced to the target population. But, as more and more individuals acquiesce to the system, the more inconvenient and, subsequently, the harder it will become for the rest of us to opt out. Eventually, the ability to opt out will be removed altogether.

'Spielberg': A worthy look at the famed filmmaker,"(CNN) For film fans, the first half of ""Spielberg"" -- a splendid HBO documentary -- should replicate that over-the-moon feeling, chronicling Steven Spielberg's early life and career. The second half, perhaps inevitably, sags a bit, but nevertheless conjures a deeply personal portrait of this extraordinarily versatile filmmaker.
That versatility is perhaps best characterized by Francis Ford Coppola, one of the many influential directors with whom Spielberg grew up in the movie business, which is perhaps the documentary's strongest component. Coppola notes that while there are directors who make prestige films and others who deliver commercial blockbusters, no one has moved between those two realms with the facility Spielberg has exhibited -- a talent he compares to composer George Gershwin.
Directed by Susan Lacy, best known for PBS' ""American Masters"" series, ""Spielberg"" opens with ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" one of the movies that helped inspire Spielberg's passion for movies. It then appropriately segues to the troubled making of ""Jaws,"" which not only launched him into the Hollywood stratosphere but helped rewrite the rulebook for blockbusters, along with his pal George Lucas' ""Star Wars.""
Interviewing dozens of colleagues, family and critics, ""Spielberg"" elicits some of its most illuminating observations from the director himself, who is remarkably forthcoming in discussing his childhood (""Everything scared me when I was a kid""), his parents' rather messy divorce and his sensitivity about misfires like the comedy flop ""1941,"" which left him ""devastated.""
"" allowfullscreen>
For those who aren't familiar with it, the most remarkable chapter might be Spielberg's wunderkind beginnings -- how he hung around the Universal lot, earned the patronage of executive Sid Sheinberg and wound up directing TV episodes in his early 20s before making the leap to the TV movie thriller ""Duel"" and feature films.

Deep Impact: UK Gambling and the UKGC

The Tenets of UKGC Regulation
The United Kingdom Gambling Commission, a.k.a. the UKGC, is the sole regulatory and licensing authority in Great Britain. It is wholly responsible for issuing gambling authorization to individuals, businesses and national lottery providers operating within the United Kingdom. The UKGC is also a progressive institution with wide-ranging powers to control, monitor, and offer assistance to individuals, companies, and gambling providers. This includes issues related to problem gambling activity, charitable fundraising opportunities, and the like.
The United Kingdom Gambling Commission provides a user-friendly approach to stakeholders with a full spread of gambling-related options in the form of consultations, codes of conduct, eServices online applications, et al. The costs and conditions related to online gambling licensing are fully covered by the comprehensive services offered by the UKGC. In the United Kingdom, there are 3 unique types of licenses that businesses may require, including premises licenses from the local authority, UKGC-issued personal management licenses, and UKGC-issued operating licenses.
The fully regulated nature of the UKGC and gambling activity in Great Britain is designed to protect the industry and stakeholders, as well as the public at large. In Britain, personal functional licenses are required by slots attendants, blackjack dealers, Roulette croupiers, casino management and the like. The application process for a gambling license must comply with the terms and conditions of the Gambling Act 2005. According to this legislation, annual fees must be paid in full up front, or the operators may forfeit their license. There are no refunds on license application fees or annual fees, unless an overpayment was made.
The strict compliance requirements are designed to set a high standard in Britain, and this is precisely what the UKGC has succeeded in achieving. Licenses in the United Kingdom are required for a wide range of gambling services including: lotteries, gaming machines, gambling software, bingo, casino, arcades, and betting. Fees are paid in full on non-remote operating licenses, remote operating licenses, and personal licenses.
How Effective is UKGC Licensing and Regulation on Gambling in the Britain?
Over the years, the UKGC has been instrumental in liberalising gambling activity in Britain to the point where it is now the world’s most progressive gambling economy. The UKGC has conducted extensive surveys, where it evaluates public opinions on gambling. According to the UKGC survey in 2010, 78% of Britons believed that legal-age gamblers should be allowed to play whenever they wanted. This dropped to 67% by 2016.
Additionally, there has been an increase in the number of Britons who believe that gambling should be discouraged, up from the 2010 figure of 36% to 55% by 2016. These statistics point to a rising awareness of gambling risks and benefitsamong legal-age players, thanks to the responsible gambling codes of conduct promoted by the UKGC.
The UK has the honour of being the largest active regulated gambling market in the world. Statistics show that there are some 21 million active accounts in the UK, ranging from sports betting, poker, bingo, casino, and lottery-style gambling. UK regulation requires that operators are committed to fairness, customer support and identifying people with gambling problems. The industry makes a point of promoting responsible gambling conduct.
Public Concerns and Brexit-Related Concerns Weigh on Gambling Activity
Public Opinion on Gambling in the UK
Source: UK Gambling Commission
The above graphics indicate a short-term trend in gambling-related interest in the United Kingdom. In the UK Gambling Stats graphic, it is clear that the total gross gambling yield (GGY) in the United Kingdom was £13.8 billion (October 2015 through September 2016). With well over 106,000 employees in the UK gambling industry, Britain remains at the forefront of global gambling. The trends indicate a decline in the total number of employees, betting shops and bingo premises throughout Great Britain. There has also been a decline in the number of gaming machines quarter on quarter. Contributions to charitable causes through the National Lottery are £1.6 billion (April 2016 through March 2017), however this indicates a decline of 15% from April 2015 through March 2016. In much the same way, Public Opinion on Gambling in the UK indicates changing attitudes over time.
The modest declines in the performance of the UK gambling market are largely attributed to Brexit-related concerns. On June 23, 2016, Britain voted 52%/48% to break from the EU. The GBP plunged to a 31-year low in short order, falling from 1.48 to the USD to 1.19. This resulted in rising import costs, tightness in labour markets, and slow real wage growth. This has affected the personal disposable incomes of Britons, and has been attributed to the marginal declines in gambling activity. Data indicates that gamblers in Britain are more inclined to use social media for their gambling activity, with 26% of gamblers on Facebook, and 15% of gamblers following gambling companies on Twitter.
A total of 21% of legal age Britons have played online gambling-style casino, bingo, lottery, slots and table games. In Britain, the UKGC works diligently to achieve a socially responsible agenda. The gambling enforcement policy has expanded the range of powers for land-based and online gambling operators in Britain. To this effect, the Raising Standards Conference was recently hosted, geared towards informing operators and providing the necessary education to stakeholders. Such is the progressive nature of gambling activity in Britain, that the UKGC published a report stating that some 1,900 gambling operators have seen fees reduced by at least 10%. Greater efficiency of operations, control mechanisms and licensing procedures have helped to bring down costs dramatically.
Fees Received by the UKGC
Further, the UKGC has streamlined testing operations to allow minor technical glitches to be corrected without third-party testing to be conducted. According to official stats, some 2800 operators are managed by the licensing department of the UKGC, and some 18,000 individuals are under its control. In 2016, the UKGC processed some 280 license applications and some 2300 individual license applications.
The UKGC is also one of the strictest industry watchdogs for online gambling activity, having enforced 71 criminal and regulatory investigations in 2016, including a prosecution of £3 million against a lottery operator named Camelot. The no-nonsense approach to regulation has made the UKGC one of the most respected gambling authorities. According to the UKGC, betting remains the biggest income generator with 27% of all income, followed by casino at 27%, business-to-business supply at 24%, arcades at 7%, lotteries at 6%, bingo at 5%, and personal licenses at 4%.
The pre-stated objectives of the UKGC are the empowerment and protection of consumers, raising of standards across gambling sectors, the improvement of regulation, understanding and partnerships, and fair play for National Lottery games. The UKGC is responsible for collecting, and collating comprehensive sets of data on gambling activity. The Gambling Behaviour in Great Britain report from 2015 found that 4% of gamblers are problem gamblers, with 6.4% of them at risk.According to the report, 63% of people 16+ years of age gambled within the past 1 year, and men have a higher propensity for gambling than women (66% versus 59%). Britons enjoy lotteries (15% of gamblers) Scratchcards (23% of gamblers), and National Lottery draws (46%)."

Anonymous: Las Vegas Witness Makes Brilliant Statement: ‘In a World Where Everyone’s Kneeling…’ (Video),"(Before It's News)
 
 
Anonymous is the most famous ‘hacktivist’ group in the world. The informal nature of the group makes its mechanics difficult to define. Subsequently, without a formal organizational hierarchy, it’s difficult to explain Anonymous to the general public and the media. In this article, I’ll explain the history of the group, and offer some clarity on what’s misunderstood about them.
 
‘Hacktivist’ is a portmanteau of ‘hacker’ and ‘activist’. When people have technical skills, have access to the Internet, and understand how network infrastructure and servers work, it can be tempting to put that knowledge into having some effect on the world. The ‘activist’ part of ‘hacktivist’ means that they don’t do their hacking and cracking without a cause.

The various people behind Anonymous worldwide are united in a belief that corporations and organizations they consider to be corrupt should be attacked. If you’re an administrator for a network that has little reason to be a target for social activists, your network and servers are unlikely to become a target for Anonymous.
 
If for some reason you believe your network might become a target, I recommend testing it for handling DDoS attacks, as that’s the most common method Anonymous uses to bring down web servers.
 
Not all of Anonymous’ activities involve attacking networks or websites. Anonymous has also been active in initiating public protests. But the web and IRC channels are the lifeblood of the group. If it weren’t for the Internet, Anonymous would’ve never existed.

"Cutch Rocks, Bucs Roll 10-1","Cutch Rocks, Bucs Roll 10-1
(Before It's News)
Trevo got off on the right foot. After tossing a scoreless frame, he watched a Starling single and back-to-back-doubles by Cutch & J-Bell gave him a quick two-run pad. It would grow. In the second, the Bucs had two outs and Mad Max aboard when a Fraze double and Starling walk packed the sacks for Cutch. It is a well-known bit of Pirates lore that in nine seasons, Andrew has never drilled a grand slam. That can now be crossed off his to-do list; let the record show he got #1 off Kevin Gausman to make it 6-0. Cutch said “finally” as he hopped on the plate and the fans knew the history, too, demanding a curtain call. It stayed that way into the bottom of the fifth when Jimmy Yacabonis took the ball from Gausman. The Bucs used three singles to add one more chip to the pot (actually a bummer as they has the bases jammed w/no outs, but today, not a big deal).
Pretty good night for this dude (photo Pittsburgh Pirates)
The Birds got on the board when Chris Davis banged a two-out homer in the sixth. The Bucs had an answer – Fraze and Starling singled and Andrew, who is a triple shy of the cycle, banged another homer to make it 10-1. Cutch was pulled for J-Lup after taking the field in the seventh so that he could draw some final crowd love (pro move by Clint). Steven Brault toed the rubber and took it home from there, earning his first save in the process by tossing three frames.
Cutch happened, the pitching of Trevor Williams & Steven Brault speaks well for the future, and the Bucs are one game away from closing out the 2017 home card.
But an even better one for this guy… (photo Dave Arrigo/Pirates)
Notes:
Cutch had four hits; Fraze and Starling had two each and scored five times (it’s good to bat ahead of Andrew); J-Bell also had two knocks.
Per @theaceofspaeder: Cutch is the first #Pirates player with at least four runs and eight RBI in a game since Ralph Kiner on June 25, 1950.
Andrew chased home a career-high eight runners tonight, a feat that hasn’t been done since since Jason Bay did it in 2004 (Johnny Rizzo set the team record in 1939 with nine; Bay drove in eight twice while Ralph Kiner & Dave Robertson each did it once). Cutch passed Al “Scoops” Oliver and Max Carey for 11th in all-time Bucco RBIs w/724 (Dave “The Cobra” Parker is 10th w/758).
Trevor was sharp again – six IP, one run, three hits, one walk and six K while serving 93 pitches.
There were 19,318 at the ol’ ballyard tonight.

Does Christopher Columbus Really Deserve A Holiday?,Red Flag Warning: These California Wildfires Are ‘Among The Most Destructive Fire Events In US History’ And They Are About To Get Even Worse
George Michael regretted going to war with Sony,"Image copyright AFP Image caption George Michael likened his contract with Sony Music to ""professional slavery""
George Michael regretted suing his record label in the 1990s, a new documentary reveals.
The star took Sony to court in 1992, claiming he had little control over his work, with the company treating him as ""no more than a piece of software"".
He eventually lost the case, which put his career on hold for five years.
""It dented the armour in his career in America,"" said Michael's friend and former manager, David Austin, who produced the new Channel 4 documentary.
""He was a guy who was firing on all four cylinders and it just, it blew that candle out in the US without a doubt.""
""He says in the film, and when we were talking about the court case and how we were going to handle it, and I didn't realise this at all, but he turned around to me and said how he regretted it.""
Image copyright PA Image caption The court case cost George Michael millions of pounds
The Sony trial coincided with a devastating period in Michael's personal life, during which his partner Anselmo Feleppa discovered he was HIV positive and, later, died of an Aids-related brain haemorrhage.
In the documentary, which Michael was working on 48 hours before his death last Christmas, the star reveals he never fully recovered from Feleppa's death.
He describes the Brazilian designer as his ""saviour"", who helped him feel comfortable about his sexuality.
""It's very hard to be proud of your own sexuality when it hasn't brought you any joy,"" he says. ""Once it's associated with joy and love it's easy to be proud of who you are.""
But only a few months into their relationship, Feleppa developed a flu that wouldn't go away. He was advised to take a test and was diagnosed with Aids over Christmas 1991.
""I was absolutely devastated to find out he had a terminal illness... just devastated,"" Michael says in the documentary, which he co-directed.
Image caption Fans left tributes at George Michael's home after his death last year
That same year, Michael's friend Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of Queen, died of an Aids-related illness. Within months, Michael found himself singing at a tribute concert while facing his own lover's mortality.
""I went out there knowing I had to honour Freddie Mercury and I had to pray for Anselmo,"" recalls Michael in the documentary.
""I just wanted to die inside. I was so overwhelmed by singing the songs of this man I had worshipped as a child, who had passed away in the same manner my first living partner was going to experience.
""The performance most well-known in my career was sung to my lover who was dying.""
Michael later wrote the song Jesus To A Child as a tribute to his former lover.
""He still, 23 years later, brings a tear to my eye,"" the star says in the documentary. ""He was my saviour.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Germany’s DEA Deutsche Erdoel won the rights to partner with Mexican national oil company Pemex on its onshore Ogarrio project, the industry regulator said on Wednesday.
The tie-up marks only the third joint venture between the Mexican oil giant and a equity partner since a sweeping energy opening finalized in 2014 ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly and allowed the firm to jointly develop projects with private and foreign oil companies.
Ogarrio is a 60-square mile (156 sq km) field located in Tabasco state believed to contain 54 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in proven, probable and possible reserves.

"North Korean ship loaded with 30,000 grenades seized by US en-route to Egypt","More than 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades have been discovered on board a freighter named the Jie Shun, bound from North Korea to Egypt where it was to be accepted by shadowy ‘business’ figures in the North African country.
 
The enormous weapons haul was uncovered after the United States received intelligence that a massive shipment of grenades was traveling from North Korea to Egypt under Cambodian colors. Intelligence services working for the United States warned the Egyptian government about the ship, and their law enforcement agents sprang into action. They claim that the weapons haul had been hidden discreetly underneath huge bins of iron ore within the bowels of the ship.
 
A swiftly executed investigation which was led by the United Nations found that the weapons had been sent from Pyongyang as part of a deal with Egyptian business executives who had ordered millions of dollars’ worth of cheap weaponry from the hermit kingdom.
 
Representatives from the United States have accused the Egyptian government and law enforcement agencies of turning a blind eye deliberately to the nefarious transaction. They have claimed that the Egyptians failed to act until they were prompted by the US intelligence services to intercept the ship and confiscate the cargo. This is a claim that the Egyptian Embassy in Washington has fervently denied, claiming that the country had been completely transparent throughout the entire event and that “Egypt will continue to abide by all Security Council resolutions and will always be in conformity with these resolutions as they restrain military purchases from North Korea.” Despite the protestations of the Egyptian government, the United States does not appear to believe them and has halted and delayed £224million ($300million) in military aid to the country in response.
 
According to David Thompson, who is a senior analyst and an investigator for the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies in Washington claimed that North Korea has been using the funds accrued from these kinds of weapons shipments to finance the country’s highly controversial nuclear ambitions. In the past, it is known that North Korea has done similar deals with countries such as Iran, Burma, Cuba and at least two different international terrorist organizations. The country has also been known to finance itself in the past by drug trafficking and recent reports also suggest that agents for Pyongyang have been involved in the wide-scale theft of bitcoin.
 
It is not known whether North Korea received the money promised to them by the Egyptian business executives for the weapons shipment. According to experts, the hermit kingdom has been particularly desperate for funds in the past couple of months owing to the fresh raft of UN sanctions against the country and the potential of a full-scale conflict with the United States looming on the horizon.

“I think there is value to be had working more closely with them,” Clark told Reuters by phone, adding there might be concerns from regulators in some foreign markets.
“There are many areas that the airlines could work together on like procurement. But we have to go the first jump first to understand what it is we could do and I‘m simply the manager of one of the businesses,” he said.
“It is my superiors who have to make that call, not me.”
When asked if the pair could pursue a merger along the lines of Europe’s Air France and KLM, Clark said: “I don’t think that will be the case but it is not my call, really. It is whatever (the shareholders) may do in the future.”
Emirates is owned by the Dubai government while Etihad is owned by the Abu Dhabi government.
Etihad, which has been hit by loss-making investments in Air Berlin (AB1.DE) and Italy’s Alitalia [CAITLA.UL], said in response to Clark’s remarks that it was common for airlines to leverage in-country expertise and economies of scale.
“We constantly seek opportunities for innovative collaboration with other organisations, where it makes business and commercial sense,” an Etihad spokesman said in an emailed statement.
Last month, Etihad announced it would appoint Tony Douglas, former boss of Abu Dhabi’s airport and London’s Heathrow, as its CEO from January as it rethinks its expansion strategy.
EMIRATES ORDER PLANS
Emirates, a bigger airline than Etihad, is the largest customer for the Airbus SE (AIR.PA) A380, a plane facing slowing production rates due to a lack of sales.
Clark said an order for more was under consideration, adding that any A380 order would help replace 25 A380s due to be retired in the mid-2020s.
He did not give any details on the likely volume of any order or whether a deal would be signed at the Dubai Airshow next month.
“Airbus would love us to do that but we’ve got a few things to sort out first so I‘m not sure that we’ll get there for the airshow,” he said.
The airline is separately looking at the Airbus A350 and the Boeing Co (BA.N) 787 to meet its needs in the 250-300 seat market, Clark said. Last month he told Aviation Week magazine that a planned order was “off the table for now”.
In 2014, Emirates canceled an order for 70 A350s.
Clark said Emirates’ procurement and operational groups were engaging with both manufacturers about potential orders.
“I don’t want to focus on the Dubai Airshow,” he said of the timing. “The important thing is to get the right deal for the company at the time that suits us, not driven by a guillotine of the middle of November.”"
Could you brave an 'immersive horror' show?,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A child gets sucked down a drain by a scary clown
Earlier this month, horror movie It (based on the Stephen King novel) was released in cinemas. You may well have seen It.
But surely only the bravest among you would've gone to the ""immersive"" screenings of the movie.
Such fans would've had the pleasure of a real-life Pennywise the Clown creeping round the auditorium during the film, jumping out at them from behind and basically scaring the living daylights out of everyone there.
While many of us may think this sounds like the most utterly hideous experience in the world, not everyone feels that way - immersive horror is becoming quite a thing.
""There's huge growth in this area,"" says Simon Oakes, CEO of British horror brand Hammer, who have just premiered their first immersive show, The Soulless Ones.
Image copyright Hammer Image caption Hammer's immersive show's contemporary look is a far cry from that of its gothic horrors of the 1950s-70s
""It's a generational thing, newer audiences want something that's more tangible, emotional, more physical an experience, which is different from the promenade shows that you would've seen before, or even traditional theatre.""
As anybody who has been to the cinema in the last decade knows, many people struggle to go for more than about four-and-a-half minutes without checking their WhatsApp, so the appeal of immersive theatre may be down to being totally engrossed in something and disconnected from the outside world.
Of course, we've seen hugely popular immersive shows before with the likes of Punchdrunk and You Me Bum Bum Train.
""There's a whole generation of younger audiences who are excited about the idea of being involved in a story rather than told it,"" says Oscar Blustin, the co-writer and co-director of The Soulless Ones.
""I think gaming has a lot to do with it, and how young audiences expect things to be interactive.
Image copyright PA Image caption Now who wouldn't want this friendly chap jumping out at them in a dark cinema
""When you watch TV, we've all shouted at the screen, 'Don't go in there!' or 'Don't go upstairs', I think artists are recognising that this can engage audiences more with the narrative.""
In the case of The Soulless Ones, Simon says: ""We wanted to come up with something completely original.""
""With something like The Great Gatsby or Alice in Wonderland, the audience knows what they're going to get. If you know the show, you've already bought into what the creative expectation might be.
""So we chose to start with a completely new show, this isn't a Frankenstein or Dracula, so as a story it's original.""
Horror is arguably the genre which provides the most potential to create an immersive experience for theatregoers.
""I think that's because it's able to shed a light on your deepest fears,"" says Simon.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Stephen King wrote It - immersive screenings of which have been terrifying audiences
""We don't want to frighten people and scare people as much as unsettle them. But it's not a jump-scare performance, which a lot of the modern horror films are.
""The general philosophy behind horror is that if you don't care about the people, you don't care about what happens to them, and with the great genre directors like Kubrick and Hitchcock, you were invested in the characters.""
While the immersive screenings of Stephen King's It were just a few special ones organised to promote the film, The Soulless Ones has a residency at Hoxton Hall in London from this week until 31 October.
Oscar explains the show is about ""a hive of vampires who are trying to perform a ritual which will let them walk in the daylight - it's our take on the vampire legend"".
""That is the over-arching story, but there are 14 characters, and 18-20 different rooms around the building, they all interweave and interlink, it's a patchwork of narrative threads.""
That may sound a little overwhelming, but Simon argues one key aspect of the show's appeal is the potential for repeat visits.
Image copyright Hammer Image caption The Soulless Ones has a residency in Hoxton Hall for the month of October
""Because of the number of rooms, we've got 14 hours in total of prepared material,"" he says.
""And I hope that's one of the reasons people might want to see it again. You'd comfortably be able to see the show four times, and never see the same show twice, if you were clever about the route you take.
""Whichever room you walk into, you'll get a different side of the same story.""
Oscar points out that audiences would struggle to play with their phones during performances even if they wanted to, ""mostly because the Victorian music hall we're performing in has absolutely no signal"".
And if fans enjoy the experience, it could well lead to other similar projects.
""We're not like Marvel or DC comics,"" says Simon, ""at Hammer we feel immersive theatre is an intriguing part of what we do in terms of creating intellectual property.
""But what we do have is a place in this area, if it's successful, to be a building block to others.""
Oscar adds: ""People are so on the hunt for unique and one-off experiences in particular.
""There's so much to talk about with immersive theatre, audiences who can compare notes on what they've seen and the different experience they've had at the same show.
""In the bar afterwards I'm anticipating a lot of 'What did you see?' conversations.""

The U.S. Department of State is pulling the majority of its diplomatic personnel from the American Embassy in Havana and warning Americans not to visit Cuba after at least 21 U.S. citizens stationed there were mysteriously injured.
The State Department is sending all non-essential staff out of the Cuba leaving only “emergency personnel” which will halt all visa processing.
The department is also issuing a travel warning, urging Americans to stay away from the Carribean island nation out of fear that they could become targets as some of the attacks had happened at hotels.
The injuries resulting from what department officials refer to as “targeted attacks” range from hearing loss to cognitive issues and sleeping disorders. U.S. officials blame “sonic attacks” for the neurologic symptoms expressed by those affected.
Cuba denies having anything to do with the attacks and almost a year after the first complaints, U.S. investigators have been unable to determine who or what is causing the injuries.
Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez met with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Tuesday where he was told that “independent of who is doing it, the Cubans have a responsibility for the safety and well-being of our people.”
The reduction in staffing comes at a pivotal time in Cuba as Raul Castro is expected to step down as the nation’s leader when his current five-year term ends in early 2018.
Canadian diplomats report having suffered similar health problems.

Commie-lite crackpot Bernie Sanders has become a political force among young, uneducated and unskilled Americans because like the candy man, he is promising them free stuff. Free college tuition, free health insurance and other socialist bennies which someone inevitably has to pay for and it won’t be Bernie’s Bolsheviks. One of the more popular crusades of the socialist left is the so-called “Fight For $15” which pushes for a national $15 an hour minimum wage that will unite the burger flippers of the world. What Bernie and his fellow con artists in the Democratic party fail to tell their young dupes is that by having the government mandate $15 an hour for jobs that you could get trained monkeys to do more accurately, that they will eventually end up on the losing end as employers cut staffing and raise prices to accommodate the higher wages. Some companies are on the cutting edge and look to eliminate the need for these workers entirely through increased automation and the introduction of robotics into your local fast food emporiums.

Las Vegas Sacrifice: The Incredible Back Story Designed to Cover up the Shocking Truth!; Why Patsy Stephen Paddock Was Set Up To Be A Mass Murderer,"(Before It's News)
THE MILLENNIUM REPORT: Reporting the Most Important News in the World Today

Why Patsy Stephen Paddock Was Set Up To Be A Mass Murderer
 
 
 
 
The capstone and Illuminati all-seeing eye lit up atop the Luxor Resort pyramid (located right next to the Mandalay Bay) during the Harvest concert mass shooting
 
Mandalay Bay Resort Was The Setting For Another ‘Fast & Furious’ Type Operation Gone Bad
 
But that’s not the worst of it!
 
State of the Nation
 
“Only now does the official narrative make sense.
 The FEDs had no choice, as they saw it. Either
 Stephen Paddock was a card-carrying FBI agent
 or he was a government contractor who had to be
 sacrificed… along with a lot of innocent concert-
 goers.” 
 
— Veteran Intelligence Analyst
 
There’s a very good reason why the Stephen Paddock story makes no sense whatsoever. That’s because it makes no sense whatsoever … to anyone, anywhere.
 
Truly, the official story of what happened in Las Vegas is unraveling quicker than a cat playing with 3 balls of yarn*.
 
*Definition of “yarn” below from Dictionary.com
 
 
 
 
Stephen Paddock the government agent
 
First understand that patsy Stephen Paddock has been employed as an IRS agent, a defense auditor and a U.S. Postal mail carrier. Obviously he was drawn to government service.
 
Stephen Paddock had been an IRS agent and defense auditor
 
The mainstream media explanation for exactly how Paddock has preoccupied himself over the past many years as a gambler who traveled the high seas is a perfect alibi for what he really was—a serious agent of Deep State. We already know that Deep State will eliminate its various agents or take them out of commission by giving them new identities whenever necessary.
 
The key point here is that Paddock was chosen to be the patsy for very good reason which will eventually reveal itself.
 
 
Special Note:
 The primary signature of a false flag operation, whether the staged attack is a transparent hoax or not, is the immediate identification of a patsy also known as a lone gunman (or lone wolf). Even a 7-year-old knows that it’s impossible for law enforcement to make such a quick determination as to who the actual perpetrator is. To then declare that an individual acted completely alone when the crime scene hasn’t even been fully investigated is, at once, totally ridiculous, implausible and disingenuous. Yes, they really do think we are that stupid. But there’s also a crucial necessity for this “lone gunman” MO. Fixing the blame squarely on only one culprit closes off the possibility that there was a greater conspiracy at work. Because the true perps will do whatever is necessary not to be found out, they ALWAYS pick a patsy and run with him or her no matter how farfetched and flimsy the official narrative. In this fashion they are self-empowered to mock and marginalize all the conspiracy theorists. These conspiracy realists intuitively know that only a very deep and wide criminal conspiracy could have executed such a complex operation as the Las Vegas false flag. More importantly, these truth seekers understand that the coverup conspiracy of silence ends up being bigger than the crime itself. All of Deep State gets behind the government’s story, and God help the one who leaves the reservation of political correctness. 
 
 
Official narrative full of holes (Btw, where are all the bullet holes?)
 
The narrative that was created to set Paddock up as the worst mass murderer in U.S. history is so full of holes that there must be a very good explanation. And so there is.
 
The FBI apparently had another Fast & Furious fiasco to deal with and they needed to put it to bed quickly. What the exact details of that scheme were will likely never be known. However, the following explanation probably comes very close to what may have happened to Paddock as far as the FBI was aware of.
 
Stephen Paddock outed as an undercover arms dealer involved in ‘gun running entrapment scheme similar to Fast and Furious‘
 
Everything about this case has screamed of Paddock’s innocence. There’s not a single shred of evidence that he would ever commit such a heinous crime. His brother’s incredulity and robust defense of him was particularly compelling.
 
“Horrified” brother of Las Vegas suspect says he’s “dumbfounded”
 
What Paddock did have were LOTs of guns in his hotel room at the Mandalay Resort. How did he relocate such an arsenal into his hotel room? Clearly, such a purposeful ‘gun-running operation’ could only be conducted with the foreknowledge of both the hotel management and the FBI. Insiders know that gambling casinos are often used in this manner.
 
Multiple players and co-conspirators
 
Applying some common sense and a little intuition while analyzing this crazy saga shows that this is simply a bad deal gone awry…at least on one level. And that Stephen Paddock found himself right in the middle of it just as Lee Harvey Oswald did in Dallas in November of 1963.
 
Paddock’s brother expresses what many people now know: that Stephen Paddock had absolutely nothing to do with this terrorist event. As for who was really responsible, it appears that this was another one of those false flags within a false flag. As most people know by now, the Central Intelligence Agency implements black operations on a strictly need-to-know basis and in a highly compartmentalized fashion. This structure enables then to run simultaneously various false flags which appear to operate at cross purposes. In this way the decision-makers at the very top are completely buffered by the multiple levels of intrigue, as well as the layers of machinations within them. By purposeful design, running a false flag within a false flag, together with a hoax, becomes nearly impossible to make sense of. At the end of the day, however, TPTB do want everyone to know that the official narrative is so incredible that it could not have happened. But why would they do that? (See the upcoming Part II of this series)
 
 
KEY POINT: Whenever the power elite is really desperate, they simply ring up The Company at Langley (aka C.I.A. headquarters). The spooks can pull off the shelf — pre-manufactured — a false flag operation that is literally ready to execute. This particular on-demand type of product/service is often not perfectly engineered for the intended context; hence, it has a lot of kinks and imperfections. Remember the senseless and inscrutable San Bernardino killings that occurred right in the midst of Putin’s Russia exposing the Obama Administration for creating, funding and arming ISIS. That black op was also pulled off the shelf in a moment of great need for the NWO cabal to change the global conversation. San Bernardino Solved: A False Flag Within a False Flag — Patriots Versus Globalists
 
 
Even Israel has signaled that they had a hand in this psyop. Of course, the psyop aspect is so prominent that the U.S. Intelligence Community is also deeply involved. Not only were the FBI, CIA gun-runners and ISIS arms traffickers involved in this crazy affair, so, too, was the Las Vegas MPD and Clark County Sheriff’s Department.

Deep State has a lot of problems right now and distracting the American people was of paramount importance. Staging a shocking and horrific massacre in the gambling capital of the world — neon-lit LAS VEGAS — certainly diverted everyone’s attention from several ongoing debacles. Las Vegas Mass Shooting: False Flag, PsyOp & Black Op to Distract
 
Then there are those agents of Deep State whose job it is to make sure that the selected social media are utilized to pass the word — LAS VEGAS — around to those who need to know well in advance. Surreptitiously using the social networks to efficiently disseminate secret messages has been standard operating procedure for many years by the intel community. YouTuber Perfectly PREDICTS Las Vegas 2 Weeks BEFORE the Incident!
 
What’s the back story?
 
The critical point here is that Paddock had no idea that he was being used as the main character in the largest mass casualty event in American history after the terror attacks of 9/11, that is.
 
Now just why did TPTB really stage this mass shooting? Las Vegas Massacre: Here’s Who and Why They Did It
 
But why, pray tell, did they do it in Las Vegas right in front of the Luxor Resort pyramidand its all-seeing eye? Illuminati Esoterica Associated With The Las Vegas Mass Shooting
 
 
Let’s not forget that this “human sacrifice” took place at the Harvest Country Music Festival during the Hebrew Fall Feasts, and on the day after Yom Kippur. “Also known as Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the year for the Jews.”[1]
 
 
“Unlike the other days of the year, the High Priest alone had to perform the daily offerings and sacrifices, in addition to the special sacrifices for the Day of Atonement.”
 
 
As for the criminal masterminds who were behind this obvious false flag terror operation, they are the same cabal who did 9/11.
 
LAS VEGAS BLACK OP PERPETRATED BY ALL THE USUAL SUSPECTS
 
The Deeply Hidden Plot
 
The Las Vegas slaughter was staged-managed for very specific reasons relating to the preceding link. Whenever the headlines read as follows, there are always precise aims behind them: “Deadliest Mass Shooting In US History”: At Least 59 Killed, 530 Injured After Shooter Opens Fire At Las Vegas Concert
 
What might those hidden purposes be?
 
First, that 59 people died … and that 530 plus were injured, some of them gravely wounded.
 
What this allows for is that many ‘victims’, even though they didn’t die, could then be transported to a fastidiously controlled location such as a pre-selected hospital and killed, or sacrificed. This happened during the shocking Paris terror attacks in 2015 just prior to the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement. They apparently needed a group sacrifice for that historic event as well.

A fudged Brexit is May's best hope,"Garvan Walshe is a former policy adviser to the British Conservative Party. He is also the CEO of Brexit Analytics. The opinions in this article belong to the author.
(CNN) In last year's referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union , Theresa May supported remaining in the EU in the quietest way imaginable.
Nearly 16 months on, she still refuses to say whether she has since changed her mind. In an interview with LBC radio presenter (and CNN contributor) Iain Dale, the PM said that she would not ""answer hypothetical questions.""
During the referendum campaign she gave just one public speech and limited her campaigning to photo opportunities for local media. (Photos of the woman who is now Britain's Prime Minister holding up an ""I'm IN"" sign are available on social media, but require some digging to unearth).
This low profile enabled her to win the Conservative Party leadership contest that followed David Cameron's resignation after his referendum defeat. She was the only candidate then acceptable to both the party's ""Leave"" and ""Remain"" wings, and appointed a Cabinet balanced between both.
But she still needed to reassure the euroskeptics: that was the purpose of her infamous soundbite : ""Brexit means Brexit -- and we will make a success of it."" I may have supported remaining in the EU then, she meant, but don't worry, I'm on your side now.
Pushed by her Brexit-supporting adviser Nick Timothy, she set Britain up for adversarial negotiations with Brussels.
The business community's preferred outcome, a so-called ""soft"" Brexit, where the UK left the political structures of the EU, but stayed in economic ones (known as the single market and customs union), was dismissed.
Moderate Cabinet ministers were forced to toe the euroskeptic line. During the campaign for the snap election May called this June, nobody even thought of questioning her pro-Brexit credentials.
Leave voters trusted her: research from the British Election Study shows that the Conservatives picked up five percentage points of support from Leave voters.
Unfortunately for the Tories, her hard line drove Remain-supporting Conservatives away, and her party lost its majority in the House of Commons.
She has since clung on to office, but as the captive, rather than leader of her Cabinet.
Yet now that she must listen to it, it is not so much balanced as it is divided. She's too weak to lead her ministers, but they're too split to make her follow.
Hence the devastating impact of Iain Dale's question about how she would vote if there were another referendum on EU membership. If she had said that she would now vote to leave, she would have to explain why she changed her mind.
JUST WATCHED Emmanuel Macron: Europe needs 'more ambition' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Emmanuel Macron: Europe needs 'more ambition' 04:36
But if she said she would vote to remain, she would confirm growing Brexiteer fears that she -- along with some of her key Cabinet ministers -- didn't really support her government's main policy.
Indeed, her deputy Damian Green (a sincere and passionate pro-European) admitted he'd vote ""remain"" again and thought that Britain would be ""better off"" staying in, but that he had a democratic duty to carry out the instructions of the British people.
All of this leaves Britain in something of a bind.
Remain-supporting members of the Cabinet know that the best hope they have of mitigating disaster is to work from the inside, under the cover of a weak Prime Minister.
If they brought the government down, the Conservative Party's grassroots would pick the most anti-European leader possible. At best, this would waste valuable time (there are only 18 months left to negotiate); at worst, it would cause the negotiations to collapse.
Leave supporters see advantage in having former Remain supporters involved so they can be blamed for the costs imposed when Brexit goes wrong. But they are starting to ask how long they can continue to support a government whose leading figures think its main policy is a disaster to be mitigated, not an achievement to celebrate.
The stability of May's government is based on the willing suspension of disbelief: Leave supporters and former-Remain supporters pretending they mean the same thing when they say they want the ""best Brexit deal.""
But when leavers believe the best deal can be obtained by threatening to walk away from Europe without a deal, while the once remain supporting finance minister warns that ""no deal"" could mean planes would be prevented from flying between Britain and the EU, that suspension is called into question.
It is becoming clear that the government assembled after the June election is not capable of carrying out the revolutionary Brexit that hard line Brexiteers, most of the Tory party's members, and a significant minority of the British public want.
These Brexiteers see their government willingly capitulating to the EU's ""intransigence."" They fear the UK will end up like Norway: forced to accept EU rules without having any say in making them.
Dale's question to the Prime Minister exposed this fundamental fact. If the hardliners want their kind of Brexit, they will have to take back control of the process. Whether the Conservative Party could survive such a Bolshevik Brexit is another matter altogether. But it's becoming increasingly clear that the best May's government could achieve would be a fudged Brexit."
"Nobel-winning technique like ""Google Earth for molecules""","Three researchers won a Nobel Prize on Wednesday for developing a microscope technique that lets scientists see exquisite details of the molecules that drive life — basically providing a front-row seat to study these tiny performers in their biological dance.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said molecules can be captured down to the level of their atoms, and snapshots can catch them in mid-movement. That can help reveal how they interact.
""This method has moved biochemistry into a new era,"" the academy said in awarding its chemistry prize to Switzerland's Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne, German-born U.S. citizen Joachim Frank at New York's Columbia University, and Briton Richard Henderson of MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.
The detailed images may pave the way for developing new medicines, vaccines and industrial chemicals, but experts said such payoffs are largely in the future.
""This is a technique that is just starting to find its way into the research community,"" said Allison A. Campbell, president of the American Chemical Society. It was recently used to reveal the structure of the Zika virus.
The method is called cryo-electron microscopy. It's like ""Google Earth for molecules,"" Campbell said, because it ""allows the scientist to zoom in down to the fine detail (giving) that fine resolution that you want to have.""
Other methods have been used before to determine structures of some biological molecules, but they run up against fundamental limitations. The three winners of the $1.1 million (9 million kronor) prize adapted another technique, electron microscopy, which uses a beam of electrons rather than ordinary light to inspect samples.
Between 1975 and 1986, Frank developed mathematical models to turn fuzzy two-dimensional images into sharp, three-dimensional ones. Henderson, in 1990, was able to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at atom-level resolution, showing the technology's potential, the Nobel committee said.
Dubochet, in the early 1980s, found a way to cool the water in a biological sample so quickly that it solidified without forming the ice crystals that can disrupt the electron beam.
Those early advances were followed by others that have greatly improved the technique, the Nobel committee said.
""It's the first time that we can see biological molecules in their natural environment and how they actually work together down to the individual atoms,"" said Nobel chemistry committee member Heiner Linke.
Henderson said Dubochet ""kicked off the field; he invented this method of making specimens we now use.""
Speaking to reporters in Cambridge, England, Henderson also said he felt ""the three of us have been awarded the prize acting on behalf of the entire field.""
Frank said he was ""fully overwhelmed"" and speechless upon hearing he had won a share of the prize.
""I thought the chances of a Nobel Prize were minuscule because there are so many other innovations and discoveries that happen almost every day,"" he said.
He said he hasn't yet thought about what to do with the prize money, but added: ""I was telling my wife that we don't have to worry about a dog sitter anymore.""
The chemistry prize was the third Nobel announced this week.
The medicine prize went to three Americans studying circadian rhythms: Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young. The physics prize went to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for detecting gravitational waves.
The literature winner will be named Thursday and the peace prize will be announced Friday.

Eminem's takedown of Donald Trump: The most explosive lines,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Eminem's video message: 'We're not afraid of Trump'
Rapper Eminem took aim at President Donald Trump at Tuesday night's BET Awards in a vicious, four-and-a-half-minute freestyle.
The star said he ""came to stomp"" on the president, calling him a ""racist 94-year-old grandpa"" and accusing him of disrespecting the military.
In the video, the star paces back and forth in a disused Detroit car park, sparring with the camera as he raps.
The a capella track immediately won praise from the hip-hop community.
Snoop Dogg posted a video praising the rapper for taking a stand; Sean Combs, aka Puff Daddy, tweeted that Eminem had ""killed it""; while J Cole called the star a ""rap God"".
T-Pain appeared to voice concern that Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, had made himself a target by voicing his anger.
It's not the first time Eminem has targeted Mr Trump: A verse in last year's Campaign Speech warned voters the then-presidential candidate was a ""loose cannon"".
However his latest track, called The Storm, is notable not just for its creative profanity, but also the detail of his criticisms.
The track is even named after the ominous comments Mr Trump made last week while posing for a photograph with military leaders, suggesting their meeting was ""the calm before the storm"".
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump makes cryptic comments about ""calm before the storm""
Here are five of the most explosive lines in Eminem's rap.
1) ""A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust""
Here, Eminem is referencing the escalating tension between the US and North Korea, over the latter's nuclear activities.
President Trump has repeatedly belittled his Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Un, referring to him as ""rocket man"". Over the weekend, he appeared to reject a diplomatic solution to the situation, tweeting that ""only one thing will work!""
Eminem's full verse is: ""We better give Obama props/'Cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze/That will probably cause a nuclear holocaust/While the drama pops/And he waits for [expletive] to quiet down/He'll just gas his plane up and fly around/Till the bombing stops.""
2) ""He keeps screaming, 'drain the swamp', 'cause he's in quicksand.""
This section appears to criticise the Republican Party's failure to denounce Donald Trump, especially after his controversial argument that ""both sides"" were at fault for white supremacist violence in Charlottesville this August.
""Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4,"" raps Eminem, referencing the Marvel comic book series in order to compare Trump to The Thing, because ""he's orange"".

3) ""He attacks the NFL so we focus on that - instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada""

Eminem lingers for a long time on the president's continued attacks on American Football players, who have been protesting about police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem.
""He gets an enormous reaction/When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that/Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada/All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather/Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers,"" raps the star.
He returns to the theme later, attacking the president's attempts to suppress the protests, and suggesting the racist motivation that black people should ""know their place"".
""Now, if you're a black athlete/You're a spoiled little brat for trying to use your platform or your stature/To try to give those a voice who don't have one.""
Eminem rounds this section off by dedicating The Storm to Colin Kaepernick, the NFL player who initiated the protests. Kaepernick later tweeted his thanks to the rapper.
4) ""He don't like his war heroes captured""
Image copyright BBC / AFP Image caption Strangely, Donald Trump once endorsed Eminem as a political candidate
Here, Eminem accuses Mr Trump of double standards.
The president has accused NFL players of disrespecting the military by refusing to kneel in front of the flag, but Eminem references Mr Trump's attacks on Arizona Senator John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War.
In 2015, Trump questioned whether Mr McCain was a war hero, saying: ""I like people that weren't captured, OK?""
Eminem's full lyric is: ""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us/Unless you're a POW who's tortured/'Cause to him you're zero 'cause he don't like his war heroes captured.""
""That's not disrespecting the military,"" the star adds.
5) ""America stand up""
The song ends with an ultimatum. Eminem draws ""in the sand, a line"", telling Trump supporters they are no longer welcome to be his fans.
""Any fan of mine who's a supporter of his,"" he spits, ""You're either for or against.
""And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split/On who you should stand beside/I'll do it for you with this,"" he continues, before delivering one of the song's more unprintable lyrics.
The song concludes with the lyrics; ""The rest of America stand up/We love our military, and we love our country/But we hate Trump.""

Conservative lawmaker, Rick Brattin, introduced a bill in Missouri that will limit what items welfare recipients can purchase with food stamps.
 
He’s upset they have access to seafood and steak that he claims he can’t afford.
 
In 2013, Fox news proudly broadcast an interview with a young food stamp recipients who claimed to be using the government benefits to purchase lobster and sushi.
 
 “This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything changing,” Jason Greenslate explained to Fox. “It’s free food; it’s awesome!”
 
That story fit a longtime conservative suspicion that poor people use food stamps to purchase luxury items.
 
Now, a Republican state lawmaker in Missouri is pushing for legislation that would stop people like Greenslate and severely limit what food stamp recipients can buy.
 
The bill being proposed would ban the purchase of cookies, chips, energy drinks, soft drinks, seafood and steak with food stamps.
 
What do you think about this bill? Do you agree? Or do you think they have the right to purchase anything they want?

Fox and Others Will Feel Pain of U.S. Absence at World Cup,"In 2011, Fox paid more than $400 million for the English-language broadcast rights in the United States for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups — four times as much as ESPN had paid to broadcast the 2010 and 2014 Cups. Verizon and Volkswagen signed up to sponsor Fox’s halftime and postgame shows.
A portion of the audiences for those shows was lost Tuesday night when the United States bowed out. Even a riveting tournament next summer — which will include most of the world’s top soccer powers, including Brazil, Germany and Argentina — will not attract the same number of casual viewers who would follow the American team.
Stefan Szymanski, co-author of “Soccernomics” and a University of Michigan professor, said that the financial impact on World Cup broadcasters in the United States — Fox and Telemundo — would be the largest. But, in an email message, he cautioned that “this is all a bit tricky,” and that the American-less World Cup would still draw strong viewership.
Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, agreed. Press reports indicating a $10 million to $20 million negative impact on “the current English-language rights holder Fox ‘feels’ right in this context,” he wrote in a research note, “and represents a negligible amount for Fox.”
ESPN broadcast all 64 World Cup games from Brazil in 2014, averaging 4.6 million viewers. Games not featuring the United States averaged just 3.9 million viewers. The four American games — against Ghana, Portugal, Germany and Belgium — accounted for almost 20 percent of ESPN’s total World Cup viewers.
Telemundo, which paid $600 million for the American Spanish-language rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, will also be negatively impacted, though not nearly as much. In 2014, the four United States matches accounted for about 9 percent of Univision’s total World Cup audience. Fortunately for Telemundo, Mexico advanced to play in Russia.
Fox and Telemundo were always expected to have lower viewership numbers than ESPN and Univision. Most games from Russia will be broadcast in the middle of the night or in the early morning in the United States — which was known at the time of bidding and could be accounted for. Missing out on a minimum of three matches for the United States was nearly unthinkable.

“Last night’s World Cup qualifying results do not change Fox Sports’ passion for the world’s biggest sporting event,” the company said in a statement. “While the U.S. was eliminated, the biggest stars in the world from Lionel Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo stamped their tickets to Russia on the same day, and will battle teams ranging from Mexico to England that have massive fan bases in America.”

Bruce Lefkowitz, a Fox Networks executive who handles advertising, said last month that about 75 percent of the “marquee” sponsorship deals for the World Cup had been sold, suggesting Fox could be somewhat insulated from the impact of the United States missing out. But without the United States, Fox may not be able to meet its ratings guarantees it gave advertisers. Efforts to use the World Cup telecasts to promote other Fox programming will also be diminished.
Coca-Cola, Visa and Adidas are official FIFA partners, while Budweiser and McDonald’s are World Cup sponsors. According to The Telegraph, it costs $25 million to $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner, and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor.
The United States “is not necessarily a growth market, so all these brands are fighting for share,” said Gibbs Haljun, a managing director at GroupM, explaining why the United States missing out is not fatal to these companies. He also pointed out that the next two men’s World Cups, in Russia and Qatar, aren’t in markets that companies are desperate to get into, as they were with the Beijing Olympics or the Brazil World Cup.
Budweiser and Verizon said their strategy had not changed, while Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald’s emphasized the global nature of the World Cup as the reason they became FIFA partners.
A number of apparel companies use the World Cup as well. Adidas is a FIFA partner, while Nike sponsors the United States team.
In its 2015 financial statement — which encompassed the 2014 World Cup and its run-up — the United States Soccer Federation reported almost $102 million in revenue, compared with $76.5 million the year before. Most of that increase was from national team game revenue, sponsorship and licensing, directly related to participation in the World Cup.
National team expenses were also much higher, but Craig Depken, a professor at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, cautioned that the World Cup was still a huge net positive financially for U.S. Soccer. “They are essentially a nonprofit, and nonprofits tend to spend whatever they have.”
Donna Shalala, a member of the U.S. Soccer board of directors, tweeted that the result against Trinidad and Tobago was “unacceptable.”
“For us in U.S. Soccer more than a wake up call,” she continued. “Time for a revolution. Need a long term plan that is smart.”"

(Before It's News)
While the playoff committee doesn’t rank the power 5 conference, there is no way conference strength – which means OOC results doesn’t figure in to a committee members thought process.
Let me point out on my philosophy on these rankings – your most recent OOC results count a lot, and you’ll see me reference that throughout the season.
We’ll give each conference a relative strength value 1-10.
Let me explain my relative rankings
0-5 : Conference lacks depth no elite teams
6-7: Conference lacks depth, and there are 1-2 elite teams, and 1-2 quality teams
7-8: At least 2 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams.
8-9: 3 elite teams, and at least 2 quality teams
9-10: 1/2 of conference is elite and/or quality teams.
1) SEC – 7.5
I’m elevating the SEC this week, because I’m starting to buy that they have 3 legit top 12 teams in Alabama, Georgia, and Auburn. Beyond that the conference has little depth. Though Texas A&M and South Carolina may be decent.
Auburn has an interesting game at LSU next week. Alabama and Georgia get SEC pushovers Arkansas and Missouri.

Unless a Group of 5 or independent team can reach the top 15, there’s not much to note outside the Power 5 in terms of the playoff.

My Current Playoff Teams
As my personal criticism of the playoff committee, I don’t think the top 4 seeds order should be released until the final rankings. The playoff committee’s inconsistent and ever changing criteria is causing unnecessary frustration and confusion. It’s one of the improvement points I’d have for them.
If I had a vote this is who I would put in the playoff right now.

"Donna Karan defends Weinstein, suggests women 'asking for it'","Image copyright Mireya Acierto/Getty Images Image caption Donna Karan subsequently apologised for her comments
Fashion designer Donna Karan has defended Harvey Weinstein, who was fired from his own movie company following accusations of sexual harassment spanning several decades.
Speaking on Sunday, the designer suggested women could be ""asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality"".
Her comments have provoked a furious response on social media.
Actress Rose McGowan, who is reportedly among the film producer's alleged victims, condemned the remarks.

""Donna Karan you are a deplorable,"" she tweeted. ""Aiding and abetting is a moral crime. You are scum in a fancy dress.""
Karan later said her comments, recorded and published in the Daily Mail, were taken ""out of context"".
She was attending the CineFashion Film Awards in Los Angeles when a red carpet reporter asked her view of the allegations against the former Miramax boss.
""I think we have to look at ourselves,"" she said.
""Obviously, the treatment of women all over the world is something that has always had to be identified.
""Certainly in the country of Haiti where I work, in Africa, in the developing world, it's been a hard time for women.
""To see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women?

""I know his wife, I think they're wonderful people, Harvey has done some amazing things.""

Trial set to begin in burning death of Mississippi teen,"(CNN) A jury was chosen Monday in trial of a Mississippi man accused of killing 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, who died after being set on fire in her car in 2014.
Quinton Tellis, 29, faces a capital murder charge in her slaying.
The Courtland teen's mysterious death has haunted the small town of 500 in northwest Mississippi for nearly three years. Chambers left her mother's house in pajama pants on December 6, 2014, reportedly to clean her car.
She never returned.
When police found her later that night, she wasn't far from her mother's home. Her car was on fire, and Chambers had burns on more than 90% of her body.
She said someone set her on fire. When asked who hurt her, some first responders claim they heard her say a man's name. She was rushed to a hospital, where she died the next day.
Quinton Tellis
Courtland and Panola County residents learned last year that Tellis, who was being held in Louisiana in connection with a crime involving another homicide victim, was to be indicted in Chambers' death.
District Attorney John Champion said at the time he was ""very, very confident"" there would be no additional charges or suspects in the Chambers case.
""We do feel like, at this point, that he acted alone in this case,"" he said.
Video surveillance footage and DNA evidence found on Chambers' car keys near the scene will likely play a role in Tellis' prosecution, lead detective Barry Thompson told CNN in the special report ""Justice for Jessica,"" which airs Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on HLN with correspondent Randi Kaye.
The capital murder charge against Tellis opens the door for a death penalty case, but Champion said Wednesday the prosecution is not planning to seek the death penalty. The charge is capital murder because her death occurred during the commission of another crime: third-degree arson.
Tellis has pleaded not guilty. He declined requests for an interview.
Longtime mystery
Until Tellis' February 2016 indictment, investigators had released few details about how Chambers, a former high school cheerleader, and her car ended up severely burned in a wooded area near Courtland.
That could be because authorities had ascertained so little about her death until late 2015. Champion explained that police interviewed about 150 people, and each agreed to cooperate. That's odd in a case such as this, according to the prosecutor.
On four occasions, Champion said he thought the case had been solved, but he was wrong. Investigators received no information from their street sources, he said, and though authorities chased leads as far-flung as Tennessee, Iowa and eastern Mississippi, nothing panned out until they started taking a close look at cell phone and other data evidence.
Tellis was looked at early in the investigation, the prosecutor said, but he did not become investigators' focus until the fall of 2015.
""Things started to match up for us, and that's when we began to take a second look at Mr. Tellis,"" Champion said, adding that forensic evidence will be integral to driving the prosecution.

Jessica's father, Ben Chambers, a former mechanic with the Panola County Sheriff's Office, said he was in close contact with investigators throughout the investigation, and he witnessed their long nights, skipped vacations and the rings under their eyes.
""I've seen it day in and day out. The hard work they've done never stopped,"" he told reporters at the time of Tellis' indictment, a cap bearing the sheriff's office's logo atop his head. ""They said someday it would come, and it did. They would not give up, and I take my hat off to them.""
Ties to another homicide victim
Tellis was being held in the Ouachita Parish Correctional Facility in Monroe, Louisiana, almost a four-hour drive from Jessica Chambers' hometown, when he was indicted in her death.
He grew up in Courtland, and that's where, Champion said, he and Chambers became friends. They'd known one another for only two weeks at the time of the killing, according to investigators.
Tellis moved from Mississippi to Louisiana in the summer of 2015, the prosecutor said. Nearly eight months after Chambers' death, another young woman turned up dead.
Tellis pleaded guilty to the unauthorized use of an access card, which belonged to homicide victim Ming-Chen Hsiao, whom investigators identified as a 34-year-old University of Louisiana-Monroe student from Taiwan.
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
According to a probable cause affidavit in that case, Tellis used a bank debit card belonging to the missing woman on August 7, the day before The Clarion-Ledger reports her body was found, and then again on August 18 and 19, withdrawing $500 both times.
Authorities procured ""photo evidence"" and interviewed Tellis on August 20, at which point ""he admitted to using the Chase Bank debit card on the three listed transactions and stated that he was the individual seen in the ATM photos,"" the affidavit said.
The authorities say Tellis remains the prime suspect in Hsiao's death, but he has never been charged in that case.
He was extradited from Louisiana to Mississippi to face the Chambers murder charge.
Tellis' rap sheet
Following the probe into the debit card, police executed a search warrant at Tellis' Monroe home and discovered a quarter-pound of marijuana in his bedroom, packaged for sale.
The suspect ""stated he sold marijuana for profit. Tellis was arrested and booked"" on an additional charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, according to the affidavit.
According to law enforcement, Tellis is a gang member with a rap sheet and has served time previously, but his gang affiliation does not appear to have anything to do with Chambers' killing, and drugs do not appear to be a factor in her death, Champion said.
Mississippi Department of Corrections records indicate Tellis was convicted of fleeing police in 2010 and sentenced to five years in prison. He was convicted of residential burglary in December 2011 and again in February 2012. He received sentences of four years and three years, respectively, on those convictions.
He was incarcerated in June 2011, according to court records. Tellis was released from a Mississippi correctional facility on October 2014 after serving time for the burglaries, Champion said. That's two months before Chambers was killed.
'She just seemed normal'
One of Chambers friends, Kesha Meyer, told CNN that she, Tellis and Chambers spent time together on the day of the blaze. But he denies killing her.
On December 6, 2014, Chambers was seen at a gas station about two miles from her mother's house. Her hair was in a bun, and she was wearing camouflage pajama pants.
She put $14 worth of gas in the car and called her mother, saying she would be home right after she cleaned her car, her older sister, Amanda Prince, told CNN.
A store surveillance video shows Chambers prepaying for gas. She walks to the store's front door when something or someone catches her attention.
She waves and walks off camera briefly, comes back into the camera's view and enters the store as three men chat by the doorway. She spends about a minute at the counter before going back outside and pumping gas.
The gas station owner who helped her said nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
""She seemed normal,"" Ali Alsanai told WREG in 2014. ""She didn't seem like something was going wrong, you know? She just seemed normal. She just pumped some gas, we had a talk and she left.""
Champion said he did not believe Chambers' visit to the gas station had anything to do with her death.
JUST WATCHED Firefighters discover teen burned alive Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Firefighters discover teen burned alive 01:24
Chambers was found that Saturday night on a rural road near Courtland, her car on fire. She'd somehow fought her way out of the burning vehicle and was no longer on fire when emergency responders arrived, but she had burns on 93% of her body.
Chambers approached Courtland Fire Chief Cole Haley and said someone set her on fire.
Asked who did it, she told first responders ""Eric"" or ""Derrick,"" according to Champion. Not ""Quinton.""
It's a point the defense may seize on. However, police investigators learned from medical experts that burns in Chambers' airway may have impeded her ability to talk.
Chambers died in a Memphis hospital early the next day."
Stanford's Facial Recognition Algorithm Can Determine Sexual Orientation With Up To 91% Accuracy,"By Vin Armani
New Stanford study shows that a facial recognition algorithm can correctly determine whether people are straight or gay with up to 91% accuracy when using multiple images. Vin Armani covers the implications and fallout from the findings.
The study’s description states:
We show that faces contain much more information about sexual orientation than can be perceived and interpreted by the human brain. We used deep neural networks to extract features from 35,326 facial images. These features were entered into a logistic regression aimed at classifying sexual orientation. Given a single facial image, a classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81% of cases, and in 74% of cases for women. Human judges achieved much lower accuracy: 61% for men and 54% for women. The accuracy of the algorithm increased to 91% and 83%, respectively, given five facial images per person."

Federal Reserve Will Continue Cutting Economic Life Support,"By Brandon Smith
I remember back in mid-2013 when the Federal Reserve fielded the notion of a “taper” of quantitative easing measures. More specifically, I remember the response of mainstream economic analysts as well as the alternative economic community. I argued fervently in multiple articles that the Fed would indeed follow through with the taper, and that it made perfect sense for them to do so given that the mission of the central bank is not to protect the U.S. financial system, but to sabotage it carefully and deliberately. The general consensus was that a taper of QE was impossible and that the Fed would “never dare.” Not long after, the Fed launched its taper program.
Two years later, in 2015, I argued once again that the Fed would begin raising interest rates even though multiple mainstream and alternative sources believed that this was also impossible. Without low interest rates, stock buybacks would slowly but surely die out, and the last pillar holding together equities and the general economy (besides blind faith) would be removed. The idea that the Fed would knowingly take such an action seemed to be against their “best self interest;” and yet, not long after, they initiated the beginning of the end for artificially low interest rates.
The process that the Federal Reserve has undertaken has been a long and arduous one cloaked in disinformation. It is a process of dismantlement. Through unprecedented stimulus measures, the central bank has conjured perhaps the largest stock and bond bubbles in history, not to mention a bubble to end all bubbles in the U.S. dollar.
Stocks in particular are irrelevant in the grand scheme of our economy, but this does not stop the populace from using them as a reference point for the health of our system. This creates an environment rife with delusion, just as the open flood of cheap credit created considerable delusion before the crash of 2008.
Today, we find our economic fundamentals in complete disarray, but the overwhelming fantasy within stocks still remains. Why? Because yet again, for some reason, no one is ready to accept the reality that the Fed is pulling the plug on America’s fiscal life support. Nary a handful of economists in the world think that the Fed will raise interest rates one more time this year if ever again, and the threat of a balance sheet reduction is the furthest thing from everyone’s mind. Daytrading investors are utterly convinced they have the Fed by the short hairs. I say, the situation is actually in reverse.
The minutes from the Fed’s July Open Market Committee Meeting indicate that while the central bank has been the savior of stock investors for several years, the party is about to end. Comments on the risks a bull market might pose to “financial stability” have been more frequent the past couple of months
Only a few weeks ago, former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan commented that bond markets could collapse and bring stocks down with them do to overvaluations and increasing interest rates.
Recent spikes in markets despite a steady stream of natural disasters, threats of war with North Korea, as well is “increased inflation” (according to Fed models) due to the damage wrought by Hurricane Harvey suggest that the Fed will indeed continue hiking rates into our ongoing financial collapse.
The next FOMC meeting will conclude on the 20th of this month, and the question is, will the Fed surprise with a rate hike and/or balance sheet reduction program? I believe the odds are much higher than many people seem to think.
First, let’s be clear, historically the Fed’s predictable behavior has been to skip major policy actions in September and then startle markets with renewed and aggressive actions in December. People placing bets on a Fed rate hike in September would look at this pattern and say “no way.” However, the narrative I see building in Fed rhetoric and in the mainstream media is that stock markets have become “unruly children” and that the Fed must become a “stern parent,” reining them in before they are crushed under the weight of their own naive enthusiasm.
In my view, the Fed will continue to do what it says it is going to do — raise interest rates and reduce and remove stimulus, and that the mainstream narrative will soon be adjusted to suggest that this is “necessary;” that stock markets need a bit of tough love.
If the Fed means to follow through with its stated plans for “financial stability” in markets, then the only measure that would be effective in shell-shocking stocks back to reality would be a surprise hike, a surprise announcement of balance sheet reduction or both at the same time.
If the Fed intends to continue cutting off life support to equities and bonds in preparation for a controlled demolition of the U.S. economy, then there is a high probability at the very least of a balance sheet reduction announcement this week with strong language indicating another rate hike in December. I also would not completely rule out a surprise rate hike even though September is usually a no-action month for central banks.
This would fit the trend of central banks around the globe strategically distancing themselves from artificial support for the financial structure. Last week, the Bank of England surprised investors with an open indication that they may begin raising interest rates “in the coming months.” The Bank Of Canada surprised some economists with yet another rate hike this month and mentions of “more to come.” The European Central Bank has paved the way for a tapering of stimulus measures according to comments made during its latest meeting early this month. And, the Bank of Japan initiated taper measures in July.
Even Forbes is admitting that there appears to be a “coordinated tightening of monetary policy” coming far sooner than the mainstream expects. If you understand how the Bank for International Settlements controls policy initiatives of national central bank members, then you should not be surprised that central banks all over the world are pursuing the same actions and the same rhetoric. The only difference between any of them is the pace they have chosen in taking the punch away from the party.
The point is, when it comes to the fiat peddlers, there are indeed a few sure things, but continued stimulus is not one of them. One thing that is certain is that they will act in concert as they are clearly doing now in terms of policy tightening. Another thing that is certain is that if they plant a notion in the mainstream media — such as the notion that they are “worried about overvaluations in stocks” and that interest rates must rise, then they will follow through as they always have. Perhaps not at the pace the mainstream expects, or the pace I expect, but certainly somewhere in-between.
Finally, it behooves me to mention again that the Fed has done all of this before. In the lead up to the stock market crash of 1929, the central bank bloated stocks with easy credit measures and low interest rates, only to hike rates in the name of “quelling inflation.” This hacked the legs out from under markets with a machete, and the rest is history. The hidden purpose behind this tactic is extraordinary centralization on a global scale. The Fed is not interested in the health of the U.S. economy, it is interested in total globalization of all economies under one totalitarian umbrella. To make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs.
Of course, the Fed will not engineer a market crash in a vacuum. It is my suspicion that the next Fed meeting will be followed by a geopolitical distraction — the most likely candidate being increasing conflict with North Korea. Do not be fooled by the magic show. The real threat to us all is the central banking and international banking apparatus, including the BIS and the IMF. From now until the end of this year, remain vigilant.

Las Vegas Multiple Gunmen Seen From Hotel Guest Next Door Across The Way (Video),"(Before It's News)
 
 
 
 
 
An Australian man who was staying in the room next to the shooter in the Mandalay Bay has confirmed he witnessed multiple gunmen involved in the Las Vegas attack.
Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More...
 
“There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us. I got outside safely and was hiding in bushes,” Brian Hodge told Australia’s Courier-Mail.
 
Mr. Hodge, who was staying in room 32134, next door to Stephen Paddock in room 32135, also provided important information when he revealed that a security guard was killed by police.
 
“My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor.”
 
Who was the “security guard” who was killed by police?
 
Wendy Miller from Cooroy, on the Sunshine Coast – another Australian caught up in the Las Vegas shooting – may have provided a missing piece of the puzzle. Also speaking to the Courier-Mail, Ms Miller said she was at a bar in the nearby Luxor Hotel with her husband when she saw what she described as a “man of interest” run by.
 
Ms Miller said the man sprinted through her hotel after coming off an escalator from the Mandalay Bay.
 
“The man that they [security] were chasing was wearing a security jacket like them,” she said.
 
Mr Hodge’s eyewitness report of multiple gunmen and a dead security guard, and with Ms Miller’s report of a security guard being chased by authorities, suggest that the mainstream media narrative of the “lone wolf” gunman is not the truth.
 
The fact is that this was an orchestrated, co-ordinated attack by multiple conspirators, and the mainstream media are attempting to cover it up.
 
Two explosive videos provided to Your News Wire have also confirmed there were multiple shooters involved in a co-ordinated attack, and the mainstream media of a “lone wolf” gunman operating without a motive is a lie.
 
Both videos show gunfire originating from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, much lower than the 32nd floor, where the mainstream media is claiming Stephen Paddock, a “lone wolf”, fired on the crowd using an automatic weapon.
 
 
The mainstream media narrative regarding Paddock’s motives have also been debunked by FBI sources who reportedly claimed the shooter has links to Antifa as well as ISIS. But mainstream media is actively covering up the information, claiming Paddock had “no political or religious affiliations or interests.”
 
The fact is the Las Vegas shooting was clearly a co-ordinated false flag attack, orchestrated by Paddock as well as at least one other as yet unidentified gunman operating from the fourth floor of the hotel. The mass shooting and scores of dead will be used by the elite to further push their nefarious agenda.
 
Anybody who looks into the information available to them on the internet will arrive at the same conclusion. Unfortunately anybody who relies on mainstream media for their information will be force-fed a very different conclusion.
 
 
 
 
 
The questions must be asked: why is the mainstream media covering for a mass murderer? Why are they attempting to rewrite his past and erase his political affiliations?
 
The answers are simple. The corporate media, controlled by a small, elite oligarchy, is operating on behalf of the New World Order, attempting to mislead the public into believing their enemies are their friends, and their friends are their enemies.
 
It doesn’t suit the mainstream media’s agenda to have an Antifa member responsible for the worst mass shooting in American history. They are actively engaged in covering up this fact up so they can continue pushing the New World Order’s sick and twisted agenda.
 
Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, was an Antifa member who carried out the worst mass shooting in American history in order to create further division in American society, push the country towards civil war, and further the agenda of the elites.
 
Official Antifa facebook page, Antifa Melbourne, congratulated Stephen Paddock after the bloodiest mass shooting in America’s history, before deleting the post after a torrent of criticism.
 
 
There is an active campaign to sow division and create chaos in the United States. Organized groups are working on behalf of global organizations with the most nefarious of goals. We need to wake up and stop believing everything fed to us by the mainstream media. They have proven themselves completely unreliable.
 
We need to stop hiding from the truth.

E.U. Said to Order Luxembourg to Collect Back Taxes From Amazon,"The investigation into Luxembourg’s handling of Amazon was made public in 2014, and the commission issued a preliminary finding the following year. In it, it described how the retailer used subsidiaries in Luxembourg to reduce its overall tax obligations.
At the time, the commission said that, in a deal struck in 2003, authorities in Luxembourg had conferred “an advantage on Amazon.” The commission added that the “advantage is obtained every year and ongoing,” and that it “is also granted in a selective manner.”
Amazon does business across the 28-nation bloc, but lists its European headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country with a population of around 500,000. The agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg effectively capped the amount of tax Amazon paid, and relied on a method called transfer pricing, according to the commission.
Transfer pricing has long been used by multinational companies to assign profits to different units, depending on factors like their role in the overall business and assets. But, according to the commission, these rules are harder to apply for technology companies, because their assets, like intellectual property, are intangible.
European regulators have claimed that Amazon sent most of its European revenue from one unit in Luxembourg to a separate subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax in the country. As a result, it was able to reduce the profit it generated from its European operations and cut its tax bill, the commission said.

It is not illegal in the European Union for countries to try to lure businesses with low tax rates. But offering special deals to companies that are not available to their competitors can amount to what is known as illegal state aid.
Both Amazon and Luxembourg’s finance ministry have previously denied that the online retail giant received special tax treatment or benefits.
Amazon has already been in the commission’s cross hairs this year for unfair competition.
In May, the company reached an agreement with Brussels over its e-books business after a two-year investigation. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner, had said certain clauses in Amazon’s contracts may have made it more difficult for other e-book platforms to innovate and compete effectively with Amazon. The retailer said it would drop the clauses.

And in January, Amazon agreed with Brussels to end an exclusive deal to supply Apple with audiobooks. Brussels said that step also was likely to improve competition in the bloc.
The cases against Amazon are among several in which the commission has targeted American technology companies. European Union officials are investigating Google and Qualcomm over possible abuses of their dominant market position, while regulators in various countries have investigated Facebook over its handling of customers’ data.
Efforts to curb multinationals from dodging tax have risen in prominence in recent months.
Last month, the European Union began considering new proposals broadly aimed at tax internet companies in the countries where they generate their business, rather than allow them to shift profits to jurisdictions with lower rates.
Luxembourg has been a particular target of increased scrutiny. In 2015, Ms. Vestager imposed an order on Luxembourg to claw back about €30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit. A decision in a case considering Luxembourg’s treatment of McDonald’s is also still pending.
The prominence of Luxembourg has put Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, in an awkward position: his role includes oversight of the investigations yet his critics accuse him of having helped turn Luxembourg into a tax haven during his nearly two decades leading that country."

Cholera claims unborn children as epidemic spreads Yemen misery,"A nurse attends to cholera-infected Siddique Nuruddin Ali, 7, at a cholera treatment center in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, Yemen October 8, 2017. Picture taken October 8, 2017.REUTERS/Abduljabbar Zeyad
HODEIDAH, Yemen (Reuters) - One of the latest victims of the cholera epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people in Yemen had yet to even take her first breath.
Her mother Safaa Issa Kaheel, then nine months pregnant, was brought into a crowded clinic in the Western port city of Hodeidah by her husband, who had to borrow the travel fare from a neighbor. “My stomach started hurting more and more,” said Kaheel, 37, a hydrating drip hooked into her arm.
Once there, she was referred by nurse Hayam al-Shamaa for an ultrasound scan which showed her baby had died of dehydration - one of 15 to perish in the womb due to cholera in September and October, according to doctors at the city’s Thawra hospital.
“I felt like death,” Kaheel said, her voice strained. “Thank god I survived the (delivery), but my diarrhea hasn’t stopped.”
The Red Cross has warned that cholera, a diarrheal disease that has been eradicated in most developed countries, could infect a million people in Yemen by the end of the year.
Two and a half years of war have sapped Yemen of the money and medical facilities it needs to battle the contagion, to which aid agencies and medics say the poor, the starving, the pregnant and the young are most vulnerable.
The cholera ward is full of children - some writhing in agony, others eerily still. The blanket over one boy too weak to move rises and falls with his shallow breathing.

Save the Children said in August that children under 15 represent nearly half of new cases and a third of deaths, with malnourished children more than six times more likely to die of cholera than well-fed ones.
Millions of Yemenis are struggling to find food and the baking desert plains around Hodeidah are hotspots both of hunger and sickness.

Yemen’s war pits the armed Houthi movement against the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition that has launched thousands of air strikes to restore him to power.
At least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
The country’s health sector has been badly battered while a struggle over the central bank has left public sector salaries for doctors and sanitation workers unpaid.
Soumaya Beltifa, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Sanaa, warned that a lack of funds and health personnel were blunting efforts to eradicate the disease, making it unlikely Yemen would be healthy again soon.
“The cholera epidemic has become a norm, leading to complacency in dealing with the disease, not only by civilians but also from the various (aid) organizations,” she warned."

Africa owes a debt of gratitude to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,"Story highlights Sirleaf, Africa's first female president, has overseen a reign of uninterrupted peace in Liberia for the past 12 years
Despite developmental growth and other challenges, Sirleaf has consolidated democracy in Liberia
Chude Jideonwo is a World Fellow at Yale University. His new book is 'How to Win Elections in Africa.'
The views expressed in this article are solely his.
(CNN) Joseph Boakai has served faithfully as deputy to Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf for about 11 years.
But now they barely speak, and he has subjected her to blistering public attacks. Why?
She has said to him, according to reports, that she is not going to hand him the presidency, and he will have to work for it.
""We're asking her -- the Unity Party is her party, it's the party that would bear her legacy and she ought to be supporting it,"" he said in an interview in February.
Where he sees a personal betrayal however, the rest of the world finds moral courage. Sirleaf is after all single-handedly responsible for keeping Liberia stable and unified for the past 12 years.

The horror of Weinstein's casting couch,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein is believed to be in Europe to seek therapy
The scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein shows it is impossible to understand the history of film and television without recognising the central role, and potential horror, of the so-called casting couch.
This colloquialism refers to the capacity for auditions to turn into mechanisms for sexual exploitation. The casting couch is a kind of erotic theatre in itself: one in which would-be performers exhibit their suitability for a particular role and provide sexual favours.
It is a place with a very hierarchical power dynamic: ambitious, not to say desperate, talent; and producer, director or whoever with the capacity to make dreams come true.
As both the cliche and the grim reality have it, the talent is often a young woman, and the dream-maker an older man. This is the situation in which a 22-year-old Gwyneth Paltrow found herself when, she alleges, Weinstein made unwanted advances towards her.
In the revolting revelations emerging about sexual bullying by Weinstein - who denies the bulk of allegations against him - the power dynamic of the casting couch is shown to be a forum for sickening exploitation and potentially criminal abuse.
The most striking thing about the New York Times and New Yorker's reports is the elaborate lengths to which Weinstein and those around him allegedly went to facilitate casting couch sessions, usually in hotels.
According to several actresses quoted in recent stories, assistants would deliver on-screen talent before leaving them to their private rendezvous with Weinstein; and afterward, if they were upset, would help smooth things over by hushing things up or speaking to relatives.
It may be lazy or dangerous to extrapolate from the individual case of Weinstein to a broader problem in the media and film industries - though as I said in an earlier blog post, it is impossible not to see these awful allegations alongside those levelled at Bill O'Reilly, the late Roger Ailes, Bill Cosby and even Donald Trump.
I also said perhaps some good could come of this awful story.
If the casting couch ceases to be a forum for sexual exploitation of vulnerable, desperate performers by perverts; and if other women who have experienced the sordid worst of the casting couch feel they can come forward, the media and film industries may yet benefit from the depredations of this Hollywood thug."

Jack Harrison: England U21 midfielder on life in New York and leaving Man Utd,"Jack Harrison left Manchester United's academy aged 14, and now plays for New York City FC
Among the current England Under-21 squad is a man who counts Andrea Pirlo and David Villa among his team-mates and is coached by Patrick Vieira at New York City FC.
Jack Harrison was born in Stoke-on-Trent but educated in the United States, leaving Manchester United and England at 14 for a football scholarship at a boarding school in Massachusetts.
This week, he has been given his debut call-up to Aidy Boothroyd's squad for the European Championship qualifiers against Scotland in Middlesbrough on Friday and in Andorra on Tuesday.
Here he tells BBC Sport how he found out about his inclusion, how he came to be in the US, and his experiences there.
'I rang my mum, but she wasn't answering...'
Harrison trained for the first time with his international team-mates on Wednesday. He last played for New York City on Sunday, a 1-1 draw at Chicago Fire. Just before the game, Vieira told him he had been called up, but he ran into a problem when he tried to share the news.
The first person I called was my mum, who was in New York, but she wasn't answering. She knew I had a game so she was probably thinking 'why is he calling me right now?'
I finally got on the phone about 15 minutes before I went out to warm up and said: ""Mum, I have made the U21s - but I have got to go and warm up so I am off'. It was quick but exciting and we were both very happy.
Media playback is not supported on this device Lack of top-flight game time for youngsters is a concern - Southgate
'Only one other kid had left Man Utd'
It was Harrison's mum, Debbie, who floated the idea of moving to America, with the intention being to boost his footballing prospects as well as his education.
When my mum first introduced the idea of leaving the UK to take up a football scholarship in the States, I was really apprehensive. For a lot of the young kids in academies, they just think about making it to the first team, and in a lot of cases they don't make it.
I'm very lucky my mum helped me to have an open mind about the idea because it was a great opportunity and about much more than the football side. There was an education there as well.
There were a lot of people who doubted the decision to leave Manchester United but I am happy that I stuck with it.
I am very thankful for my time at the club - a lot of the foundation of skills I have is mainly through them. I think they were pretty disappointed that I was leaving - only one other kid had left the academy before and that was to go on a tennis scholarship - but we left on a good note. It wasn't hostile.
'Vieira and Lampard have been amazing'
Last year Harrison was the number one pick in the MLS draft, eventually signing his first professional contract with New York City. Since making his debut, Harrison has played 55 times for the first team, scoring 14 goals and providing 10 assists.
When I finally got drafted by New York City FC, I realised then I had no regrets. I would definitely recommend it to any younger player who is not getting as much game time as they would like.
It has been a great opportunity to go out there and get that playing experience under your belt. I am so grateful to be in that position. With the support of New York behind me, it is really special.
Patrick [Vieira, New York City's manager] has been amazing. He has been so supportive since drafting me. I had an injury at the time. He helped me through that a lot. Frank [Lampard, former England, Chelsea and New York midfielder] has been incredible too.
Even this past year, while he has been in England and not playing, he has reached out to me and congratulated me on a goal. Just little things like that. It might not be much to him but they mean the world to me.
City Football Group [who in addition to New York City also own Manchester City among other clubs] is an amazing organisation to be a part of. They have been so supportive of everything I have done so far. As a player, everyone dreams of playing in the top leagues in Europe. It would be a great opportunity if that was to come up.
For now, I am just focused on being at New York, finishing off the season and hopefully winning something. I will see what happens after that.

"Wildfires kill 15, destroy 1,500 homes and other buildings in California wine country","SANTA ROSA, Calif. (Reuters) - Fast-moving wildfires raging across Northern California’s wine country have killed 17 people, left about 150 missing and destroyed 1,500 homes, wineries and other structures, state fire officials said on Tuesday.
The flames from 17 major blazes have blackened more than 115,000 acres (46,500 hectares) since fires broke out on Sunday amid hot, dry conditions and high winds.
The Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office said 11 of the fatalities were in its jurisdiction, where 155 people were still missing, although 45 others had been found and some of those unaccounted for may be due to confusion surrounding evacuations.
In Napa County, the dead included 100-year-old Charles Rippey and his wife, Sarah,, 98, according to the county sheriff’s office. No other details on that incident or the other fatalities were immediately available.
Crews took advantage of cooler temperatures, lower winds and coastal fog on Tuesday to make headway against the fires but cautioned that homes, wineries and other structures remained at risk.
“We need to jump on it and take advantage of this lull before any other wind jumps up,” said Steve Crawford, a CAL FIRE operations chief, at an afternoon briefing. “There’s a lot of devastation out there, people running around who just lost everything.”
North of San Francisco, the fires reduced houses to ashes in several communities. The city of Santa Rosa was particularly hard hit by the so-called Tubbs Fire, which damaged a Hilton hotel and destroyed a mobile home park.

Tens of thousands of residents were forced to flee, as schools closed and at least two hospitals in Sonoma County were temporarily shuttered.
Napa Valley Vintners, a trade group with 550 members, said it was too early to estimate the economic impact of the fires. At least four wineries had suffered “total or very significant losses,” and at least nine reported damage to their winery, outbuildings or surrounding vineyards, the group said.
Ninety percent of grapes had been picked before the fires started, with almost all of those still on the vine Cabernet Sauvignon, a thick-skinned variety that is not expected to be impacted by smoke from the fires.

In addition to potential damage to vineyards from fire itself, sustained exposure to heavy smoke can taint unpicked grapes, according to wine-making experts.
More than 91,000 homes and businesses served by Pacific Gas & Electric were without power, with most of those customers in Northern California’s Sonoma and Napa counties, and gas was shut off to 28,000 customers, representatives for the utility company said.
California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma and five other counties.
In Southern California, the so-called Canyon Fire 2 has spread to 7,500 acres (3,035 hectares) in Orange County, destroying 14 structures and damaging 22, fire spokesman Thanh Nguyen said.
The blaze triggered the evacuation of 5,000 people in the communities of Anaheim Hills and Orange Hills as it spread through grass and oak trees, he said, and was only 25 percent contained as of Tuesday afternoon."
Britain hopes U.S. will keep politics out of Bombardier decision,"Bombardier's new Global 7000 business jet (rear) is seen parked next to a Learjet 75 during the National Business Aviation Association conference and expo at the Henderson Executive Airport in Henderson, Nevada, U.S., October 8, 2017. REUTERS/David Becker
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain hopes a provisional U.S. ruling imposing tariffs on Canadian aerospace manufacturer Bombardier (BBDb.TO) will not be politically influenced when new evidence is considered, UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said on Tuesday.
Clark said he was confident the British government could successfully fight the complaint, which was brought by Boeing (BA.N) and could cost jobs in the British province of Northern Ireland.
“Following the initial determination, there is then a further call for evidence ... we look to the U.S. to make sure that this is a rigorous process and is not politically influenced,” Clark told lawmakers.
The U.S. Commerce Department has raised proposed trade duties on Bombardier CSeries jets to nearly 300 percent, backing Boeing’s complaint that the Canadian company received illegal subsidies and dumped the planes at “absurdly low” prices.
The decision could effectively halt sales of Bombardier’s new plane to U.S. airlines by quadrupling the cost of the jets imported to the United States, although Clark said the jet did not directly compete with Boeing’s aircraft.

Clark said British Prime Minister Theresa May had twice discussed the dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump, and that several members of the British government had reinforced their “serious concerns” with the U.S. administration over the ruling.
He added Britain would discuss the ruling with the United States, Canada and the two companies in the coming days.
Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, and the decision to impose duties on the planes has put 4,200 jobs at risk.
But Britain is also a major base for Boeing. The company has recently begun constructing its first European parts manufacturing site in Sheffield, northern England, and Britain has warned that Boeing might miss out on future business over the row.
“Boeing has a reputation in this country that was beginning to grow in a positive way, through the investment in Sheffield and elsewhere,” Clark said.
“To jeopardize that reputation and relationship by doing something that is completely unjustified is something that I don’t regard as being in the strategic interests of Boeing.”"

Bill on Guardianship Abuse Goes to Trump-But What Does it Actually Fix?,"By Janet Phelan
Senate Bill 178, The Robert Matava Elder Abuse Prosecution Act of 2017, has passed both the Senate and House and has gone to the President for signing into law. The Bill contains provisions on multiple issues involving abuse of older people, including telemarketing scams and elders incarcerated in foreign countries.
The Bill also takes a stab at addressing guardianship abuse, which has now become rampant in the US. This sort of elder abuse, however, involves multiple levels of government officials, including judges, officers of the court, non-responsive APS and police agencies, as well as already documented complicity by the very Department of Justice which is now mandated with investigating these crimes.
Guardianships are generally initiated through court proceedings when a family member or others make allegations that an individual is lacking capacity to handle his or her own affairs. Upon the appointment of a guardian, the alleged incapacitated person loses the lion’s share of his rights, including even the right to hire his own attorney to contest the guardianship. In addition, his assets are transferred to the care and authority of the guardian, who will also now make personal decisions for the ward, including whether or not he can see his own family, where he will live, what sort of medical care he will receive and more.
Guardianships are money intensive. It is estimated that 1.5 million adults in the US are under a guardianship, with assets between $50 and $300 billion having been transferred to the guardian.
The Bill requires at least one assistant attorney general to be appointed to each federal judicial district to investigate reports of wrongdoing by guardians. The Bill also mandates training a crew of FBI agents to investigate crimes by guardians and sets up a “Elder Abuse Czar” to oversee these new provisions.
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM
However, the Bill ignores the glaring reality that guardians must report their actions and account for the ward’s funds to the court. Judges regularly approve accountings that don’t add up and also accountings that are clearly fraudulently enriching the guardian and attorneys at the expense of the life savings of the ward.
And judges do far worse than accommodate theft.
When California guardian Melodie Scott decided to withhold life-saving antibiotics from Elizabeth Fairbanks, who had come down with pneumonia, this decision resulted in Fairbanks’ death. San Bernardino Probate Court judge Mike Welch approved this decision by Scott without so much as missing a beat. Recently, Scott’s license to practice as a guardian (professional fiduciary license) was revoked by the State of California in a State office of Administrative Hearings Court.
About ten years had passed since Scott pulled the plug on Elizabeth Fairbanks. Dozens of other questionable deaths have been alleged to have taken place on Scott’s watch, including that of Lawrence Yetzer, Stevie Price, D’Wayne Cory and Frank Bellue, to name but a few. The current San Bernardino Probate Court judge, Kyle S. Brodie, however, continues to appoint Scott to new cases. Nothing in Senate Bill 178 remotely addresses the complicity of Probate Court judges in guardianship abuse, either physical or financial.
Recent investigations have raised serious questions as to whether these judges are being paid off under the table. The bizarre and untruthful response by the Department of Justice official Marve Williams, reported in the Vegas article linked above, should raise alarm. This is the same Department of Justice that is going to address crimes of guardianship abuse, according to Senate Bill 178.
While the Congress should be congratulated for finally attempting to address the issue of guardianship abuse, the Bill sent to Trump is a no-show. It fails to address the systemic nature of guardianship abuse and, once again, gives wide swath to the individuals who are truly responsible for the abuse. A black robe and a law degree are apparently still the best protection that money can buy, even against prosecution for the crimes of embezzlement and murder.

CW's 'Dynasty' will be about more than catfights,"(CNN) The first episode for the CW's reimagining of ""Dynasty"" has a lot of the ingredients that made the original series a hit -- family drama, lavish displays of wealth and even a fight between two women to capture the spirit of the so-called catfight legacy left behind by the show on which its based.
It's a formula that served the original series well. The primetime soap ran on ABC for nine season from 1981-89.
But the new series aims to take that winning formula and update it for a new era and audience.
""The original dynasty was fantastic and no matter what you do, some of that diamond is going to sparkle through,"" showrunner Sallie Patrick told CNN in an interview. ""We're just trying to re-shine it, I guess.""
Much has been made about ""Dynasty's"" play to follow in the heeled footsteps of CW's ""Gossip Girl,"" in part because both center on a group of one percenters and also because they come from executive producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage.

Puerto Rico is far from OK (Opinion),"Tanzina Vega covers race and inequality for CNN Money and is currently on leave as a Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton University. Follow her on Twitter @tanzinavega . The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.
(CNN) As Americans watched the devastation unfolding in Puerto Rico last week I read, listened, tweeted and posted information on my social media timelines. Then came the text bubbles on my cell phone screen:
""Is your family ok?"" they asked.
""I'm praying for you,"" they said.
I felt conflicted about how to respond. In some ways, things are ""okay."" The few immediate family members I have on the island are alive. Some rode out the storm from the mainland and are trying to return to their communities to assess the wreckage that awaits. For many Puerto Ricans on the island and in the larger diaspora, however, we have a long way to go before ever getting back to ""okay.""
The island's status as a United States territory -- and by extension, its peculiar and colonial relationship with the United States -- has been exposed to the rest of the world like the roots of the trees left bare from the force of Maria's winds and rain. In a blistering public statement , a group of Puerto Rican intellectuals and activists said, ""The world has found out in the past few days what our history has always stubbornly made visible to us.""
The effects of Hurricane Maria will force some residents to leave the island, and their homes, behind. The ongoing fiscal crisis has already precipitated a massive loss of talent on the island. We could be on the precipice of yet another great migration to the mainland, with many Puerto Ricans settling throughout the United States. The crisis could also signal a new political awakening among Puerto Ricans eager to examine the colonial status of the island and prevent further economic and cultural erosion.
The island is now bracing for its own major reconstruction, whose cultural, economic and, and psychosocial effects will take years to unravel.
Puerto Ricans have always had an imbalanced relationship in the United States: a permanent state of yes, but no. We are United States citizens by birth, but those who live on the island have limited rights. They cannot vote for president and have no vote in Congress. Antiquated policies like the Jones Act, which require all goods ferried between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans, have further hurt the island's economy.
I'm a national reporter at CNN on a teaching fellowship at Princeton, but I am also a Puerto Rican woman from New York, a Nuyorican, a Boricua. I spent half of my childhood visiting my family on the island in many of the towns that have been decimated by Hurricane Maria, including Utuado and Arecibo. Generations of my family have lived and died on the island. Many of my generation grew up listening to tales of the radical Young Lords Party of the 1970s, swinging to our parents' old salsa records and creating icons of our own, including Sonia Sotomayor, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin and Lin Manuel Miranda. I took for granted that the Puerto Rico I knew would always exist. Like my grandparents, I assumed that one day I would be able to return and have my own small piece of paradise.
After Maria, a harrowing report in The Washington Post described Utuado, where my father's side of the family is from, as ""a prison"" with residents trapped by mudslides, impassable roads and little to no food, drinking water or power.
Nestled deep in the lush mountains of Puerto Rico's Cordillera Central, it used to take hours of navigating curving twisted roads to reach Utudao. I know the trip well. I made it almost every time I visited Puerto Rico as part of the annual island pilgrimage many mainlanders made to visit our abuelos, our tios and our primos. It was that deceptively simple fluidity of movement, from the island to the mainland and back, that helped create the bicultural and transmigratory ties many Puerto Ricans still have to the island.
The response to Maria could also make more Puerto Ricans politically engaged than they have been in the past. ""It's a call to action for Puerto Ricans in the diaspora, that we all have to get to the polls and make sure that if our island counterparts can't have their voice heard during elections that we vote on their behalf,"" said Elizabeth Aranda, a sociology professor at the University of South Florida and author of the book ""Emotional Bridges to Puerto Rico."" ""What affects them on the island affects us.""
""Puerto Ricans have paid their dues, even though people think that haven't,"" Aranda also observed. ""They have been paying taxes, they pay higher prices for consumer items, they are the testing ground for all sorts of experiments."" Indeed, Puerto Rican women in particular have been used to testing pharmaceutical products from birth control to opioids like OxyContin.
Los Angeles Times investigation found that the first patients to use the drug were ""women recuperating from abdominal and gynecological surgery at two hospitals in Puerto Rico in 1989.""
President Trump, during his visit to the island this week, tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd and callously remarked on how few people had died and how much recovery efforts would cost the United States. He added to the pain that many Puerto Ricans are feeling, in a way that Aranda described as ""a form of symbolic violence."" Many Puerto Ricans may be asking themselves, Is this really my country?
Today, the United States is experiencing a wave of calls for racial and social justice in a way that we haven't seen in decades. Puerto Ricans, who are black, white and brown are not exempt from that discussion. In addition to the ""symbolic violence"" we are experiencing post-Maria, we too have been impacted by mass incarceration, police brutality, racial profiling and unfair socio-economic policies.
The summers I spent in Puerto Rico were one of the brightest parts of my childhood. They were an escape from the pressures many of us experienced living on the mainland. Instead of being surrounded by red brick public housing buildings, I would rock back and forth on the hammock my grandparents in Barceloneta had hung on the balcony of their home, reading and watching the trees bend in the breeze. I woke up to the sound of a rooster's crow as chickens clucked in the gravel and dirt yard. Lemons grew on a tree in front of the house. My grandfather would pluck them one by one, gingerly slicing and squeezing them to make juice. My cousins and I ran around in plastic chancletas, t-shirts and shorts and ate homemade ice pops. Those summer breaks were a respite of nature and love.

When my grandfather in Utuado died I was about a year into my first reporting job at The New York Times. At the top of those mountains, I delivered an impromptu eulogy as raindrops gently tapped the dark green awning covering his casket and our small group of mourners.
I had spent the day before the funeral cleaning out drawers in his bedroom and had found various files he kept for decades including a certificate from when he studied English during night classes at the local high school in New York City and receipts for classes on how to repair washing machines and other household appliances. He even did a short stint as a busboy in the New York Times cafeteria. Even though his English was still not advanced enough to read the paper, he would occasionally take a copy home for his cousin to read. When he died, I placed a copy of the paper with a front-page story I had written in the casket. ""We made it, abuelo,"" I said.
Today, as I watch the island I love try to rebuild, I can only hope that we will make it, again."
"German prosecutors say no evidence of US, UK eavesdropping","Federal prosecutors say they have concluded a nearly four-year evaluation of possible eavesdropping of German telecommunications by U.S. and British secret services and concluded there is not enough evidence to open a formal investigation.
Prosecutors' spokeswoman Frauke Koehler said Thursday that, among other things, her office had considered material collected by a parliamentary panel, German intelligence reports and documents leaked from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
She says ""the documents did not provide any information on concrete interception measures that were carried out, and with this background there is no room for an investigation by prosecutors.""
The examination was ordered after Snowden in 2013 revealed details of secret U.S. eavesdropping programs."
"What Happens To The Media’s ""Stale"" News?","By Catherine J. Frompovich
Have you ever questioned what happens to ‘stale news’ and why we don’t hear updates as to how a “news issue of the day” somehow disappears down a convenient ‘memory hole’? One specific news detail that comes to mind, as an example, is the John Podesta emails, which somehow was ‘credited’ with scuttling the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.
Investigative journalist Abby Martin examined what happened with the Podesta emails and produced an in-depth report about John Podesta and his brother Tony, who are some of the most influential movers and shakers in Washington, DC. The Podesta Group is one of the most—if not the most—influential lobbying firms in the geopolitical “swamp.” Learn about their list of clients at 11:49 on the timeline of the video below.
Abby Martin places the Podesta influence under a high-magnitude “investigative microscope,” as readers probably have not known how deeply the Podesta influence runs in the nation’s Capital and international affairs.
Around 17:15 on the timeline, Abby highlights the Russian uranium deal, “Uranium One,” and explains how Hillary was left blameless. Enter Jose Fernandez and scandal averted!
Did you know the Podesta Group successfully stalled a congressional investigation into the BP oil spill, according to Martin?
We learn from Abby the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia funded the Clintons with tens of millions of dollars, plus $140 thousand per month to the Podesta Group! The Clintons have many financial friends in the Middle East, it seems.
Probably the most egregious unknown news item is how the Clinton camp tried to exert influence upon a U.S. Supreme Court decision. At 23:09 on the timeline we hear, “We managed to cow the court into submission on the first Obamacare case; let’s do it again.”
The Washington, DC “swamp politico” has many influential critters of varying stripes and persuasions. Learn about them in this 24 minute, attention-grabbing exposé by investigative journalist Abby Martin.

Syrian War - How America Shot Itself in the Foot,"By Chris Kanthan
Total fiasco. That’s a quick way to characterize the US adventure in Syria in the last six years. The proxy war not only failed to accomplish its goal – removal of Assad – it tremendously weakened the US in the Middle East, strengthened its adversaries, and soured its relations with many allies. If it were a movie, America’s recent Mideast policy would be called, How to Lose a Region in 6 Years; and if it were a book, it would be titled, How to Win Enemies and Lose Influence. To make things worse, globalists have refused to acknowledge their mistakes and are now doubling down on their failed policies.
Let’s start with the claims of all the great pundits, military experts and politicians who have been consistently wrong since 2011.
Assad must go; Assad will be gone soon
Syrians will rise up against Assad
Soldiers from the Syrian Army will desert in masses and overthrow Assad
Ok, Syrians couldn’t do it, but surely Al Qaeda will bring down Assad
Al Qaeda couldn’t do it, but ISIS will definitely finish the job
The (good) terrorists will win if they just got more guns and anti-tank missiles
Let’s spend a few more billions of dollars on training and arming the rebels. Victory is near!
Russia will never intervene!
Russia will lose Crimea and access to the Black Sea!
Russia’s economy is about to collapse because of our sanctions and low oil prices (which we might have rigged)!
Syria will become Russia’s Afghanistan!
Humiliating Defeat in Syria
Every one of their predictions and tactics failed. How about their eventual goals behind the Syrian war? Break up Syria into ethnic regions – including an extremist Sunni region controlled by Saudi Arabia, build a Qatar oil/gas pipeline thru Syria to Europe, let Israel drill oil in Golan Heights, and kick Russia’s naval base out of Syria. All those geopolitical goals were blown to smithereens.
Not only did they fail in everything, they made things worse. Syria used to be quite pro-West. Before the war, Assad would visit France and the UK, and U.S. leaders such as Nancy Pelosi and Jimmy Carter have visited Syria. But, from now on, Syria will treat the U.S. as public enemy #1 for the foreseeable future.
Russia had only mild influence in Syria before. However, now, Russia’s missile defense systems and military/naval bases have been firmly established in Syria. Basically, the war gave Russians what they could only dream of before.
Iran & Hezbollah
Similarly, their strategy to contain Iran worked precisely the other way. In their paranoia, Saudi Arabia and Israel thought they could preemptively stop the so-called Shiite Crescent – contiguous areas of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Instead, Iran’s para-military forces and Hezbollah’s fierce fighters saved Syria from ISIS and Al Qaeda. Thus, Iran and Hezbollah are now adored as heroes in Syria.
Regarding Iran, the US policy has also been schizophrenic. Obama’s lifting of sanctions and the nuclear deal have been followed by intense animosity and saber rattling. Even though Iran has been sticking to its promises, Neocons and the pro-Israeli crowd in Washington are still itching for a war with Iran.
Iraq
If you thought, “Okay, at least they didn’t screw up Iraq,” you’d be too optimistic. After the Al Qaeda-ISIS plan failed, Israel is now supporting the formation of Kurdistan – essentially the breakup of Iraq. In fact, the Kurds’ eventual goal is to form a large Kurdistan that would encompass lands from Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria. Thus, thanks to Israel, Iraq is aligning itself with Iran and Turkey, and moving away from the US. Iraqi leaders are also flying to Moscow and forging deals with Putin.
Turkey
One of the most important Islamic countries in that region is Turkey. It’s also a NATO member that hosts a strategic NATO military base. For five years it colluded with America and other allies in the proxy war against Syria. Then, in 2016, the CIA pulled a fast one and attempted a military coup to overthrow Erdogan. Embarrassingly, the coup failed. Hence it’s no surprise that Erdogan flipped 180 degrees and has been warming up to Russia.
Erdogan has quickly signed many deals with Putin, including Russian pipelines through Black Sea, a Russian nuclear power plant in Turkey, and Russia’s famous S-400 missile defense systems. (Unlike the American systems, the S-400 will shoot down US missiles and planes). Erdogan has visited Tehran (Iran’s capital) and received Putin in Turkey in the last year, and has made it quite clear that he’s not firmly in the US sphere of influence anymore.
To make things worse, the Turkey-US relations are deteriorating every day. Just this week, Turkey arrested an employee at the US consulate in Istanbul, after accusing him of being a spy who participated in the coup last year. This has led to both countries suspending visa services in their consulates.
Turkey is also working out military and economic deals with Iran. Those two have even agreed to forego the US dollar and conduct their trades in local currencies.
As I explain in my book, Syria – War of Deception, the US needs Turkey for numerous geopolitical reasons, including gaining influence in Central Asia to slow down China’s rising power.
Qatar and Saudi Arabia
Not content with this chaos, globalists have also managed to engineer a conflict between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, both hosts of large US military bases. Having your friends fight against each other weakens your alliance – this is Geopolitics 101. Right after Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the Saudis initiated a land/air blockade of Qatar. Guess who’s been providing food and other essentials to Qatar for the last few months? Iran and Turkey.
Qatar has also been bonding with Russia and China. It bought 16% of Russia’s oil giant (Rosneft) and then sold it to China. Qatar is also conducting a lot of business with China in Yuan, foregoing the almighty US dollar. Thus you can add Qatar to another US ally who has learned to share their loyalty with the enemies of the US.
If all of that sound bad, Saudi Arabia’s King made a historic visit to Russia in October and signed several deals with Putin to stabilize oil price and purchase Russia’s missile defense system. This is amazing for many reasons. Saudi Arabia and Russia have been bitter enemies for decades. The Saudis funded the Mujahideen in Afghanistan that defeated the USSR; then they funded Islamic terrorists in Chechnya that caused enormous problems and humiliation for Russia in the 1990s; and the Saudis funded Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria. Saudi Arabia is also an American vassal state that plays a key role in the maintenance of petrodollar. If Saudi Arabia decides to sell oil in other currencies or gold, the US dollar would be decimated. Given all that and Russia’s alliance with Iran (Saudi’s nemesis), one can see how monumental the new Saudi-Russia partnership is.
Conclusion
The US foreign policy worked well in the era of Cold War when alliances were binary and US allies had nowhere to go. However, the Syrian war revealed that the US is not the only sheriff in town – Russia and China are playing lead roles in global geopolitics. The US needs to learn the art of diplomacy. Instead of spending a lot of time constantly demonizing and threatening other countries, the US foreign policy must focus on quietly working out deals behind the scenes. Finally, the US must accept a multipolar world where other nations are treated as partners and not as vassal states.

“It was torture for us,” she said. “For us, this was a time of suffering.”
As Latin America remembers Guevara’s death, the region also faces a larger reckoning with the same leftist movements that drew on him for inspiration.
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the region’s largest remaining guerrilla group, came out of the jungle and gave up its arms this year in a war where no one won but Colombia lost more than 220,000 people.
The Socialist-inspired movement of the late President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela led to gains in education and health care, but the country has sunk into hunger, unrest and dictatorship.
Even Cuba, which for years proudly lived under the revolutionary banner hung by Guevara, now faces an uncertain fate as a détente reached with the United States unravels under the Trump administration.
Bolivia is one of Latin America’s last democracies where leftists remain in control, and it is difficult for political movements to thrive in such a vacuum, one of the country’s leaders said. “You cannot prosper or sustain yourself over time if you do not have the victories and struggles in other places,” said Álvaro García Linera, the vice president of Bolivia.
Jon Lee Anderson, who wrote a biography of Guevara and was key to discovering his remains — they were hidden by soldiers until the 1990s — says both Guevara and the left hit such low points before.
“But Che remains kind of pure,” he said. “An ever-present beacon, the icon. Where will it go in the future? I have this notion that Che comes and goes.”"
NFL Players Kneeling ‘a Protest Against America’,"NFL Players Kneeling ‘a Protest Against America’
(Before It's News)

By Rich Mitchell
WASHINGTON, DC, Sep 29 – President Donald Trump is taking heat for condemning NFL players who are using America’s national anthem to protest so-called police brutality. But, says AMAC president Dan Weber, “could it be that Mr. Trump really believes citizens should respect the symbols of our democracy?”
Refusing to stand for the Star Spangled Banner is not a protest against police brutality; it’s a protest against America.
Weber, chief of the nation’s largest conservative senior advocacy organization, the Association of Mature American Citizens, thinks that the president, “like most patriotic Americans, says what he means and means what he says: ‘sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their national anthem or their country.’ And, certainly, no matter what the anti-Trump protestors may say are the reasons behind their antics, refusing to stand for the Star Spangled Banner is not a protest against police brutality; it’s a protest against America.”
Weber said, “Celebrities and those in positions of power should not let their anger at wrongdoing turn into hatred against our country, whether it be real or perceived. Too many Americans of all races and creeds have died defending America, our flag and our national anthem to disrespect their sacrifices. Outspoken, reasonable dissent is a right of all citizens and has made our nation strong since its founding. Stand up for causes in which you believe but stand up, too, for our homeland.”
Robert Tracinski, a senior writer at The Federalist, says the NFL player protests are part of a “resistance” movement against the president. In an article published in the Federalist earlier this week, Tracinski wrote: “The whole idea of ‘taking the knee’ began, from what I can gather, as a way for a mid-grade quarterback to sulk about being benched. Then it turned, supposedly, into a symbolic protest against the injustice of police gunning down innocent black men. This was originally in response to the ‘hands up don’t shoot’ narrative about the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, a narrative that was comprehensively debunked by the Department of Justice civil-rights task force the Obama administration sent to Ferguson.”
But President Trump has been denigrated for his position. Many individuals appearing on nationally televised news programs and quoted in major daily newspapers say his message is racist and that he is racist. In an interview broadcast on CNN, for example, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) called the president an “abject liar” and “clearly racist.” ESPN anchor Jemele Hill called him a “white supremacist.” The New Yorker accused Trump of practicing “racial demagoguery.” And, a Miami Herald article authored by Jenee’ Osterheldt labeled him “a president who stands for oppression.”
AMAC’s Weber argues that the president is not a racist and that he, Weber, is not a “shill” for Donald Trump. “I am, however a person who loves the USA. It saddened me when President Obama went on his worldwide ‘apology tour’ at the beginning of his first term in office and was widely applauded by the left for his gesture. It gladdens me when President Trump, at the outset of his presidency, stands up for America with the approval of a very large segment of the population. The plain and simple truth is that he saw the NFL protestors disgracing our national anthem and said something about it, much to the chagrin of his detractors.”

Panasonic expects autonomous driving system launch in 2022,"FILE PHOTO: A mock-up of an autonomous car interior is shown at the Panasonic booth during the 2017 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 5, 2017. REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File PIcture
TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp’s autonomous driving system is expected to be launched in commercial vehicles as early as in 2022, in a move that will likely help the Japanese company narrow its gap with rival suppliers in a highly competitive market.
Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc’s mass-market Model 3, has been reinventing itself as a provider of advanced auto parts to escape the price competition of smartphones and other lower-margin consumer products.
The new autonomous driving system will enable autonomous driving at low- and medium-speed ranges including self-valet parking, Panasonic said on Tuesday.
“We know we are behind our rivals right now,” said Shoichi Goto, director in charge of vision and sensing technologies at the firm’s automotive R&D division.
“But we have developed key LSI (large-scale integration) chips for advanced image processing and sonar sensing that would give us major advantages, using expertise from television sets and cameras.”
The new chips need more testing and polishing before the commercial launch of the autonomous driving system, added Goto, previously a TV engineer.
Panasonic has been pushing to expand its range of advanced driving-related products to better compete with top suppliers such as Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Continental AG.
The firm has said it plans to nearly double its automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen ($22 billion) by the year to March 2022, from 1.3 trillion yen in the year to March 2017.
Panasonic established the automotive R&D division in April, transferring about 350 engineers from TV, the company’s mainstay at the time, and other consumer electronics businesses.
To bolster its push into the automotive field, Panasonic took control of Spanish auto parts maker Ficosa International SA earlier this year.

The Rock Has Officially Filed His 2020 Presidential Campaign,"Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson has officially filed his 2020 Presidential Campaign with The Election Commission.
 
In what would have felt like a bizarre dairy dream just a few years ago, the WWE champion turned movie action hero could be taking on reality star/sitting president Donald Trump to become the leader of the free world.
 
According to records, the official paperwork has been filed on behalf of the Get Smart star by a man from West Virginia called Kenton Tilford.
 
The connection between the two men is, as of yet, unknown.
 
 
 
Top 3 contenders for 2020:
 
1) The Rock
 2) Mark Zuckerberg
 3) Milkshake Duck
 
 
We have seen charismatic Dwayne take on everything from earthquakes to mummy-hunting archaeologists in his films.
 
He has even shown comedic talent, playing Obama in a Saturday Night Live skit before a podium labelled ‘The Rock Johnson 2020’.
 
However, now that the joke is fast becoming a reality, what sort of President would he be? Is the American public tiring of celebrities trying their hand at politics?
 
 
 
Imagine The Rock being our president and interrupting Vladimir Putin during a crucial meeting to tell him it doesn’t matter what his name is
 
 
 
Rumors have been circulating for quite some time. Back in June 2016, Alyssa Rosenberg from The Washington Post wrote an opinion piece which suggested that Dwayne could be a viable candidate.
 
Here, Alyssa stressed how The Rock’s national and global popularity could prove to be an important factor when gathering support.
 
Alyssa also discussed The Rock’s clean, non-controversial political record:
 
If he doesn’t have policy or issue bona fides, Johnson’s relative silence on substance also means he doesn’t have a record that can be used to tar him as some sort of flip-flopper.
 
And he could also make a series of carefully selected charitable and political donations designed to start building a record of positions.
 
It’s easier to teach talking points than charisma, as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) experienced earlier this year.
 
Dwayne responded to The Washington Post piece on Instagram, calling it ‘interesting’ and ‘fun to read’, whilst stressing the need for ‘strong honest leadership’.
 
At this point, he was still just toying with the idea of going into politics, having previously made the following statement:
 
I can’t deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring.
 
And beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on people’s lives on a global scale. But there are a lot of other things I want to do first.
 
However, it is now clear that he was beginning to ponder over one pretty big ambition…
 
 
 
Sure The Rock would make a better president than Trump, but so would an actual rock.
 
 
 
In May this year, The Rock spoke with GQ about the ‘real possibility’ of running for presidency.
 
Here, GQ writer Caity Weaver praised Dwayne’s ‘industrial strength patriotism’, with the athletic actor often taking to social media to give thanks to members of the armed forces.
 
Dwayne also gave a glimpse as to what his presidential style might look like, making the following admission:
 
Personally, I feel that if I were president, poise would be important. Leadership would be important.
 
Taking responsibility for everybody. [If I didn’t agree with someone] on something, I wouldn’t shut them out. I would actually include them.
 
So far, Dwayne has remained pretty neutral when discussing what his political views are, and is standing as an Independent candidate rather than a Democrat or a Republican.
 
He has in the past been a supporter of the Republican Party, speaking at the Republican National Convention back in 2000. He has also been an active campaigner in encouraging young people to vote.
 
Time will tell whether or not there are some winning policies behind that winning smile…

"Weakening Nate brings rain, tornado warnings to U.S. South","BILOXI/PASCAGOULA, Miss. (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.
Maximum sustained winds from Nate, the fourth major storm to hit the United States in less than two months, dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour) as it moved through Alabama and into Tennessee.
The remnants of the storm spawned tornado warnings in those states and the western portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. It is forecast to bring gusty winds and up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain to parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York on Monday.
The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph (113 kph) but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.
Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage. “We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” he said.
Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.
Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.
The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall and storm-surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the hurricane center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.
The storm was expected to bring three to six inches of rain to parts of western North Carolina through midday Monday, with up to 10 inches possible in isolated spots. Power outages, damaged homes and roads closed by debris were all reported in the region.
Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.
In Biloxi, water surged over roads during the storm and quickly receded on Sunday, leaving a boat that broke loose marooned on the beach. At a Waffle House restaurant, the storm surge deposited a dumpster in its parking lot.
Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.
“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”
Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.
“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

At the Golden Nugget Casino, one of eight Biloxi gaming establishments, workers rushed to clean up mud, debris and minor damage from 3 feet (1 m) of water sloshing into an entrance and the parkade. The gaming room stayed dry.
Three hundred guests remained in the hotel, some eager to try their luck after surviving Nate.
But dangers from the storm remain, with Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of tornadoes springing up in the Panhandle region and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey urging residents to prepare for strong winds and storm surges.
U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.
Mississippi Power had restored electricity to 10,000 customers, but 4,800 were still without it. More than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.

Alabama Power said it had restored electricity to 58,000 of 146,000 customers who lost it.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches (25 cm), was expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the hurricane center said.
NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED
Forecast at one point to make landfall in Louisiana, Nate headed farther east and spared many New Orleans parishes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago.
“I had prayed for this - that we would be spared,” said Amos Cormier, president of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana’s equivalent to a county.
Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.
New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he expected that evacuated residents could return home soon.
Vessel traffic and port operations at New Orleans resumed on Sunday afternoon, while the Port of Mobile in Alabama remained closed. Oil ports, producers and refiners in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were planning reopenings as the storm moved inland on Sunday.
The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.
The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador."

By Donn Marten -
The reigning champion Chicago Cubs were looking at a near insurmountable two-game lead in a best of five series late in Saturday night’s game against the Washington Nationals. The gutty Cubs had a 3-1 lead and despite not having his best stuff, pitcher Jon Lester managed to pitch his way out of a bases-loaded jam while the Nats offense continued to misfire. But Cubs Manager Joe Maddon outsmarted himself by yanking Lester far too early and by the time that he was made to realize his mistake, the game was over as the Nationals destroyed the mediocre tomato can of a reliever that the skipper trotted out to face the murderer’s row of the meat of Washington’s lineup. The body language of Carl Edwards Jr. was that of a beaten man, far from exuding the confidence an chutzpah necessary to face down Trea Turner, Bryce Harper, Anthony Rendon, Daniel Murphy and Ryan Zimmerman.

"Dusty Baker Is Back at Wrigley Field, Still Looking for a Ring of His Own","“It’s sad that a manager, and even some players, are looked at differently because they don’t have a World Series or an N.B.A. championship behind their name,” said the Nationals’ bench coach, Chris Speier, who also worked with Baker in Chicago and Cincinnati. “I don’t feel that anybody should be judged because they haven’t done it. You look at their track record over all. Wherever he’s gone, he’s proven he’s a winner.”
Baker stayed three more seasons with the Cubs after they lost the 2003 National League pennant to the Marlins, who infamously scored eight runs in the eighth inning of a Game 6 comeback in the N.L.C.S. A Cubs fan deflected a catchable foul ball, a shortstop made an error, a bunch of Marlins got hits — the warmed-over details are well-known here.
But if Baker still felt connected to the Cubs, it did not show up in his rooting interest last fall. After the Nationals lost by one run to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fifth game of their division series, Baker watched the World Series as a neutral observer. He had friends with both the Cleveland Indians and the Cubs.
“I was neither rooting for them nor against them,” Baker said Sunday of the Cubs. “I was just rooting for a good game, because I didn’t have any skin in the game, and I’m not a gambler. I just wanted a good game, and that’s what we got; we got some good games.”

He continued: “Deep down inside, we were one out or one pitch away from that possibly being us. But you can’t live in the past.”
Indeed, October heartbreak has stalked Baker’s teams since 2003. Before last October’s excruciating division series loss, his Reds lost in the same round in 2010 (Philadelphia’s Roy Halladay pitched a no-hitter in the opener) and in 2012, to the Giants, after winning the first two games on the road. The Reds replaced Baker after they lost the N.L. wild-card game in Pittsburgh the next season.
The Nationals hired Baker before the 2016 season after negotiations with another candidate, Bud Black, collapsed. A team that had underachieved in its final season under Matt Williams coalesced around Baker.

“The individuals on the team bought into the cohesiveness of the unit,” Speier said. “That’s something he’s always preached, because of his background of always having your brother’s back, no matter what. That’s been at the forefront ever since I’ve known him — you take yourself out of it and worry about your brother.”

In a way, Baker’s pursuit of a title mirrors his team’s. Washington has won a World Series before, and so has Baker, but both were much different then. The Washington team that won it was the Senators, a precursor to the Minnesota Twins, in 1925. When Baker won it, in 1981, he played left field for the Dodgers.
This is Baker’s 14th trip to the postseason (four as a player, one as a coach, nine as a manager), and he does not change with the seasons.
“Same as always — it’s Dusty,” said Max Scherzer, Washington’s Game 3 starter, who insists his sore right hamstring can withstand 100 pitches on Monday. “He’s always got a great story for you, somehow, some way. He keeps everybody loose, everybody laughing. Nothing’s really changed.”
The Cubs had a light, optional workout on Sunday morning, with many players appearing on the field only to sample the breakfast arranged on the warning track behind the plate. Joe Maddon, the Cubs’ irreverent manager, has done this before in October, complete with an N.F.L. game on the video board. Maddon wore a Joe Namath jersey in the clubhouse, though he made no guarantees for his team.
“We’re not there yet,” he said, smiling.
The Nationals held an afternoon workout, with no food or football in sight. Everyone took batting practice or fielded balls in the outfield, just as they would in the regular season. The Cubs’ offbeat vibe is not Baker’s style.
“It’s not my thing, really,” he said. “My thing is, No. 1, I’m an innovator of stuff. I don’t copy other people. Most of the time, they copy me. And No. 2, they can do what they want to do. I really don’t care, honestly. It seems to work for them, and our own thing seems to work for us.”"

"Speed up Brexit transition talks or deal will be worthless, says UK's Hammond","LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Wednesday the value of a transitional Brexit deal would decline rapidly if talks to agree it drag into next year, but said it was too soon to spend money on contingency plans.
Negotiations on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union have made slow progress before a March 2019 deadline. Talks on a transition period have not even begun.
And while Hammond thinks it’s too early to begin enacting contingency plans for a failure to reach an agreement, EU diplomats and officials are putting renewed focus on preparing for a legal limbo after March 2019.
Their efforts have intensified as Brexit negotiations stall on issues like the bill Britain must pay to leave and the future of Northern Ireland’s land border with the EU. If progress does not pick up, Hammond said, a transition agreement will rapidly diminish in value.
“It is self-evident to me ... that a transitional arrangement is a wasting asset. It has a value today. It will still have a very high value at Christmas, early in the new year,” Hammond said.
“But as we move through 2018 its value to everybody will diminish significantly. And I think our European partners need to think very carefully about the need for speed in order to protect the potential value to all of us of having an interim period.”
British Prime Minister Theresa May has set out plans to seek a transition period after March 2019 with a set time limit. During that period, Britain wants to operate under the same rules as it currently does to provide certainty for businesses while allowing new arrangements to be put in place.
Business leaders have repeatedly called for clarity on the trading conditions they will face during the transition period and beyond. Some - including banks in London’s financial sector - are making arrangements to move overseas to ensure continued access to the EU market.
Hammond said lack of direction to talks was hurting business investment and consumer confidence, and one of his top advisors said international banks would make decisions to move in the first three months of 2018.
Britain had hoped EU leaders would agree to start talking about the future at a summit next week. But European Council President Donald Tusk poured cold water on that idea on Tuesday, saying he hoped it could happen in December.
Hammond called on the EU to change their approach, warning of the possibility of a bad-tempered breakdown in talks which would see EU countries acting against their own interest.
“We have made the running in this and we really need our European Union partners to engage ... We are not asking them to sign up. We are not asking them to write blank cheques. We are simply asking them to start talking to us,” he said.
NO DEAL
The limited progress in Brussels has drawn calls from some British lawmakers to walk away from the talks and start preparing for a clean break with the bloc.
Hammond is considered one of the most pro-EU members of Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet, and pro-Brexit lawmakers and campaigners have accused him of trying to water down or even halt Britain’s exit.
He said the government was planning for all possibilities, including Britain’s leaving with no agreement on the terms of its departure or how the two would build a new relationship. He said 250 million pounds ($330 million) was being spent on planning for all scenarios.
But he rejected the idea that Britain should begin putting “no deal” contingency arrangements in place, including a suggestion from a member of his own party that the government should start spending money to beef up border and customs capabilities.
“Some are urging me to spend money simply to send a message to the EU that we mean business. I think the EU knows that we mean business,” Hammond said. “I don’t believe we should be in the business of making potentially nugatory expenditure until the very last moment when we need to do so.”
However, he warned that he would have to start spending in 2018 if there was no clear prospect of a transitional deal.
“There will be some areas where we need to start spending money in the new year if we can’t tell ourselves that we are moving steadily and pretty assuredly toward a transition agreement,” he said.

"White tiger, dark horse: North Korean art market heats up","DANDONG, China (Reuters) - Seated beneath tall windows and dressed simply in singlets and trousers, North Korean painters are hard at work. The artists staple canvases to frames or copy idyllic landscapes from laptop computers. One wears headphones as he brushes a group of running horses onto his canvas.
The nine men have come to the Chinese border town of Dandong from Mansudae Art Studio, North Korea’s largest producer of art. There are many outlets like this along the border; they house some of the thousands of North Korean artists who cater to burgeoning demand for their work. “Chinese have begun collecting art, and North Korean art is much easier and cheaper for them to obtain,” says Park Young-jeong, a research fellow at the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute, a Seoul-based organization.
In recent years as countries have responded to North Korea's weapons tests with sanctions, Mansudae and other art studios have increasingly played a more controversial role – helping Pyongyang raise cash abroad. North Korea has long been punished for alleged underhand dealings in minerals, finance and arms; art was seen more as a channel for mutual understanding. That is changing.

Mansudae is run by the North Korean state. Its output ranges from statues of global leaders to propaganda posters, embroidery and more. It has built monuments and statues in at least 15 African countries, according to independent United Nations sanctions experts.
In a report in February, they said that a part of Mansudae called Mansudae Overseas Projects was a front for the North Korean state to cash in on military deals. As well as monumental statues, they found it built military installations such as a munitions factory and bases in Namibia.
A diplomat at the North Korean mission to the U.N. in Geneva said Mansudae had nothing to do with funding weapons manufacturing. No one from Mansudae could be reached.
The U.N. Security Council banned Mansudae’s statue business in 2016. On Aug. 5, after Pyongyang conducted more weapons tests, the Security Council blacklisted Mansudae Art Studio, subjecting it to a global asset freeze and travel ban. Diplomats say this will prevent Mansudae from conducting business.
“With this listing, anything Mansudae produces - including paintings, other artwork, monuments, buildings, and other construction - cannot be bought and should be frozen per the asset freeze,” said a U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In a further resolution on Sept. 11, the Security Council decided that all joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals must be shut down within 120 days, or by mid-January.

Exactly what the measures mean for existing Mansudae art has yet to become clear. In Beijing’s art district, a gallery called the Mansudae Art Gallery says it is the studio’s official overseas gallery. Its head insists the sanctions do not apply to it and says they have had no impact on his business.
“Now more than ever we need avenues like art to create understanding between North Korea and the rest of the world,” said Ji Zhengtai.
It is not possible to estimate the total value of Mansudae's dealings, but the Security Council diplomat said the business had earned tens of millions of dollars globally.

“WE DON‘T DO POLITICS”
Mansudaeartsudio.com, a website in Italy which calls itself Mansudae’s “official website abroad,” says the studio is “probably the largest art production center in the world.”
Mansudae’s Pyongyang studio covers 120,000 sq m (nearly 30 acres), employs about 4,000 people including around 1,000 artists, and is divided into 13 creative groups, seven manufacturing plants and more than 50 supply departments, the website says.
The website is run by Pier Luigi Cecioni, who sells Mansudae works online and at fairs through what he calls an exclusive agreement with Mansudae Art Studio. He declined to say how much he sells, but in August after the sanctions on Mansudae Art Studio were announced, he told Reuters that the revenues go direct to the studio to pay for paints and equipment.

Cecioni said he sells works from his personal collection, most of them bought several years ago - before sanctions on Mansudae were announced. His website makes clear that any online purchase is made with his Italian company, not Mansudae. U.N. sanctions are not retroactive.
A panel of independent experts is charged with monitoring U.N. sanctions on North Korea. It reports violations and recommendations to the Security Council’s North Korea sanctions committee. Its reports are confidential, but the committee traditionally publishes annual reports.
The head of the Mansudae Art Museum Ji Zhengtai talks about a painting by a North Korean artist in the studio of the gallery in the 798 art district in Beijing, China, September 20, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter
Hugh Griffiths, who heads the panel, declined to comment, saying “the matter is subject to an ongoing investigation.”
Cecioni said, “the last thing I want is to have trouble with Italian or American authorities. I have strong contacts, especially with the Italian ones, and they help me to respect all the rules.” An Italian foreign ministry source said it is customary to keep contact with everyone who has ties to countries under sanctions, to ensure they respect Italy’s international commitments.
In September, Cecioni said that he had no plans to shut down his operation. “I consider it very important to let people know that ... North Koreans do not make only bombs but also art and are common people,” he said. He postponed an exhibition of propaganda posters he had planned for September in Treviso, but said this was because Mansudae’s representatives told him they thought it unwise to showcase their anti-U.S. tone in the current climate.
Word of the sanctions has been slower to reach China. A circular from its Commerce Ministry announcing the start date of the measures which included Mansudae Art Studio does not name Mansudae. Asked why not, the ministry did not respond.
The Dandong center works in partnership with Mansudae, said its manager, Gai Longji. Asked on the day the sanctions took effect if they were affecting business, he did not answer directly.
“We don’t do politics,” he said. “We do art.” Liaoning Sanyi, the firm behind the center, did not respond to a request for comment.
WHITE TIGER
Reuters spoke to at least 30 experts - collectors, art historians, academics and people who have sold North Korean art globally. Many said the market for paintings is niche and amounts to little in terms of revenue compared with the billion-plus dollars North Korea has raised every year selling coal and other minerals abroad.
Slideshow (16 Images)
Even so, they say North Korean diplomats in Europe have been enthusiastic to promote art exhibitions with the simple aim of bringing in hard currency.
In China, demand has really taken off. Dandong is a popular attraction for tourists who come to peep at North Koreans over the Yalu River border. Busloads of tourists show up every morning. Visitors sample a North Korean specialty of noodles in cold soup, watch North Korean women sing and dance, and buy North Korean paintings.
Besides Mansudae, just about every ministry and almost all the local authorities in North Korea have an art studio, said Koen De Ceuster, a lecturer in Korean studies at Leiden University who has been studying North Korean art for over a decade. “There’s studios all across the country,” he said.
Other prominent studio names include Paekho and the Central Arts Studio. Paekho, which means “white tiger” in Korean, is the biggest seller of popular paintings in Dandong, traders there said. Collectors who have dealt with Paekho say it is run by North Korea’s military - Reuters could not independently establish this. Paekho’s varied output includes propaganda posters calling for a nuclear-free world.
The Dandong center that Reuters visited has hosted around 500 North Korean artists since 2014, manager Gai said. They stay for between six months and three years.
Many Dandong galleries house North Korean painters. Staff there said they have sold North Korean paintings for as much as $100,000 to buyers around the world. Art experts agree the pieces can very occasionally fetch six-figure sums.
Not all the proceeds go to Pyongyang. Mark-ups can reach four or five times the dealer's purchase price, according to one Dandong dealer.

LONG GAME
While the Security Council’s Aug. 5 sanctions targeted only Mansudae, its September resolution on joint ventures also included restrictions on North Korean labor: This combination could hurt everyone in the art business, Dandong traders say.
But there are ways around the measures, they add. For instance, paintings from Mansudae could be sold under the name of an art studio that hasn’t been sanctioned. Artists come to China under cultural exchange visas, not as workers. And two businessmen said paintings have long been accepted instead of cash in the barter deals that fuel the region’s economy.
At the other end of the border from Dandong in the city of Yanji, Chinese antiques dealer Zhao Xiangchen said people usually roll up a couple of paintings and carry them quietly across the border to him.
His antiques stall was thick with dust as he camped in a vacant slot next door, selling the paintings online.
Since the sanctions were announced, Zhao said, Chinese customs have become more vigilant.
“But I‘m playing the long game,” he said. “I still think there’s huge latent demand for North Korean art in the Chinese market, that’s only set to grow.”

Italian woman granted sick pay to look after ill dog,"Image copyright Alamy Image caption A judge ruled that the dog's illness amounted to ""serious or family personal reasons"" for leave
An Italian woman has won a legal battle for sick pay for time she took off work to look after her dog.
The woman, an academic at Rome's La Sapienza University, won the case with the help of lawyers from Italy's Anti-Vivisection League (LAV).
It is the first such finding by an Italian court.
A judge accepted the woman's case that the university should put the absence down to ""serious or family personal reasons"".
The academic, who has not been named, took two days off to care for Cucciola, a 12-year-old English Setter, after the dog underwent surgery.
Her lawyers pointed to a provision in Italian law which says people who abandon an animal to ""grave suffering"" can be jailed for a year and fined up to €10,000 (£9,000).
""It is a significant step forward that recognised that animals that are not kept for financial gain or their working ability are effectively members of the family,"" Gianluca Felicetti, president of LAV, said.
""Now, those in the same situation will be able to cite this important precedent,"" he added."
"Stephen Miller, the Powerful Survivor on the President’s Right Flank","“He just seemed really happy,” said Charles Gould, a classmate and friend at the time, “as if that’s how he planned it.”
In the years since, Mr. Miller has rocketed to the upper reaches of White House influence along a distinctly Trumpian arc — powered by a hyper-fluency in the politics of grievance, a gift for nationalist button-pushing after years on the Republican fringe and a long history of being underestimated by liberal forces who dismissed him as a sideshow since his youth.
Across his sun-kissed former home, the so-called People’s Republic of Santa Monica, they have come to regret this initial assessment. To the consternation of many former classmates and a bipartisan coalition of Washington lawmakers, Mr. Miller has become one of the nation’s most powerful shapers of domestic and even foreign policy.

“The 31-year-old?” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, muttered to reporters earlier this year, despairing over who might be making decisions in Mr. Trump’s White House.
Yet on perhaps the president’s signature issue — immigration policy — Mr. Miller has emerged in recent days as the driving force behind the administration’s insistence on a wish list of hard-right proposals as part of any deal with Democrats to protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation. White House demands include a crackdown on unaccompanied children at the border, the construction of a border wall with Mexico and legislation to sharply reduce legal immigration.

As the surviving watchman on the president’s right flank since the removal in August of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist, Mr. Miller also remains a key craftsman in speechwriting at the White House. Mr. Trump, who has long prized Mr. Miller’s fierce loyalty, has embraced his instincts to sharply restrict the number of refugees admitted to the United States next year and to impose new travel restrictions on several predominantly Muslim countries and others deemed to be national security risks.
From the administration’s opening stanzas — when Mr. Trump let fly his “American carnage” inaugural address — to his swaggering turn last month before the United Nations, it is Mr. Miller’s worldview, as often as anyone’s, that the president projects on the grandest scale.
“We have this running joke,” said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, “that if we were going to get key man’s insurance on anyone, Stephen would top the list.” She was referring to policies that companies take out on their most important employee.
The Beginnings in Santa Monica
Mr. Miller’s journey to this point, outlined over dozens of interviews with friends, classmates and current and former colleagues, is a triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance. It is a story of beliefs that congealed early in a home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue-state ZIP code, and of an ideology that became an identity for a spindly agitator at a large and racially divided public high school.
These formative years supplied the template for the life Mr. Miller has carved out for himself in Washington, where he remains the hard-line jouster many of Mr. Trump’s most zealous supporters trust most in the White House — and many former peers fear.
“I can hear Stephen’s voice,” said a fellow Santa Monica student, Nick Silverman. “Even when Trump reads these statements, I know, ‘That’s Stephen.’”
Through Mr. Miller’s nearly nine months in the Trump White House, the question — how did he come from here? — has curdled across these eight square miles of progressive oceanside paradise, where a stroll near the beach can quickly produce images that border on a self-parody of limousine liberalism. Environmentalist stickers festoon a neighborhood pocked with gas guzzlers; a small dog, seated in a stroller, twitches in the sea breeze, rumbling past a homeless man sprawled across a sidewalk bench.
“It does have this tang of the seething id of Santa Monica,” another student, Jake Zambas, said of Mr. Miller’s nativist streak, noting that their high school, like the town, was largely self-segregating. “Everyone here is just a scared white person.”

In his time on this campus of roughly 3,000 students, Mr. Miller sculpted the brand of hard-charging conservatism that would deliver him to the president’s ear, tracing a pathway at once complicated and straightforward. Mr. Miller, the middle child in a financially comfortable Jewish family, plainly relished the attention and notoriety of being the city’s red-hued exception, according to classmates — some of whom recalled chuckling at, or at least shrugging off, the antics of their resident gadfly. The line between puckishness and principle blurred in due time.
Photo
Mr. Miller set off on a patriotic semi-striptease before the editor of the student newspaper, according to the editor, Ari Rosmarin, theatrically removing a button-down to reveal an American flag T-shirt in protest of an article he found inconsistent with the national interest. (The White House denied any symbolic unbuttoning, though officials confirmed Mr. Miller’s fondness for the T-shirt.)
He jumped, uninvited, into the final stretch of a girls’ track meet, apparently intent on proving his athletic supremacy over the opposite sex. (The White House, reaching for exculpatory context, noted that this was a girls’ team from another school, not his own.)
Most memorably, classmates say, Mr. Miller established a reputation for barreling eagerly toward racial tinderboxes, leaving some to wonder whether his words were meant to be menacing or hammy. Jason Islas, who had been friendly with Mr. Miller in middle school, has little doubt.
Shortly before the start of ninth grade, Mr. Islas said, he received a call from Mr. Miller informing him that the two could no longer be friends.
“He gives me this litany of reasons,” Mr. Islas said.
Most were petty, if mean, he recalled: an insult about his social awkwardness, a dig at his acne-specked face. But one stuck out.
“He mentioned my Latino heritage as one of the reasons,” Mr. Islas said. “I remember coming away from the conversation being like, ‘O.K., that’s that.’”
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called Mr. Islas’s account “a completely inaccurate characterization of their relationship, or lack thereof,” disputing his recollection and suggesting the two were more acquaintances than friends.

But several students said Mr. Miller’s trail of racially tinged comments amounted to a pattern. He railed against bilingual announcements, asking in a local editorial why there were “usually very few, if any, Hispanic students in my honors classes, despite the large number of Hispanic students that attend our school.”
Latino students remembered him engaging them outside group meetings, asking why they required a separate forum to discuss issues of identity, and chafing at Spanish being spoken in the halls.
“He tended to make some of the Spanish language stuff very personal,” said Moises Castillo, a classmate who described the exchanges as hurtful to this day. “There was a ‘if you’re not speaking English, perhaps you should go somewhere else.’”
He was asked whether Mr. Miller may have been leaning into a sort of provocative shtick, or crafting a character deliberately. In the campaign speech, after all — a portion of which was captured on video and published by Univision in February — Mr. Miller often appears to be smirking.

“It’s a character?” Mr. Castillo said. “When you hear it more than once, when you hear it in private, when you hear it in public, that ‘character’ kind of fades away. That benefit of the doubt is gone.”
Mentors on the Right
Mr. Miller’s defenders have argued that Mr. Miller’s high school persona — more merry prankster than fearsome bomb thrower, in their view — should not diminish the seriousness of his beliefs. Mr. Miller has attributed his conservative awakening, in part, to encountering right-leaning writings on gun policy and other issues, including a 1994 book, “Guns, Crime and Freedom” by Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association leader.
Mr. Miller has said he was also shaped by his school’s response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he confronted what he believed to be excess political correctness and insufficient support for American military efforts. Among his causes: pressing administrators to require the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. (He prevailed.)
Mr. Miller found mentors in David Horowitz, the onetime “New Left” Marxist who evolved into a conservative author, and a radio host, Larry Elder, who booked Mr. Miller as a recurring guest. He courted local controversy by inviting both to campus for speeches.

“He was already reading Ayn Rand. He was already reading the Federalist Papers,” Mr. Elder said, describing Mr. Miller as effectively a fully formed ideologue by the time he contacted the radio host’s show. “It’s not an act. He believes what he believes.”
News articles have often described Mr. Miller as the product of liberals whose politics changed through sheer force of their son’s arguments. Public documents do support this timeline: Mr. Miller’s parents, Michael and Miriam, changed their registration to Republican from Democrat after Mr. Miller left for college, according to Los Angeles County records.
But some who knew the family at the time have challenged the suggestion that he was raised in a classically hard-left Southern California home.
Ms. Miller’s brother, David Glosser, said the elder Mr. Miller, a real estate investor, had longed skewed conservative on some issues, describing him as a “responsible, thoughtful sort of economic Republican” that Mr. Glosser contrasted with Mr. Trump.
Messages left for Mr. Miller’s parents were not returned. Mr. Miller declined to be interviewed.
At Santa Monica Synagogue, the Millers proved an awkward fit in the largely liberal Reform congregation, according to people who knew them then. The younger Mr. Miller — true to form — established himself as the perpetually debate-ready boy who most enjoyed taking on all comers in 10th-grade confirmation class. A group photo, with Mr. Miller grinning from the back row in a prayer shawl, still hangs in the hall.
“We did our best here,” said Mr. Miller’s rabbi, Jeff Marx, “to teach Jewish ethics and talk about our need to reach out to the strangers, to those less fortunate than we are.”
By then, the Miller family had suffered its own notable reversal of fortunes. Earthquake-related property damage had upended Michael Miller’s real estate business, forcing the family to eventually abandon its stately home in the city’s exclusive North of Montana neighborhood.

Some classmates have speculated that the move, which found the family in a new house a short distance from the grittier and far more ethnically diverse Pico neighborhood, helped shape Mr. Miller’s still-developing views of race and class as he wended through his teens.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
But others have dismissed this theory, suggesting that the family’s plight should not be overstated. A visit on a recent weekday found a succession of Mercedes-Benzes and Lexuses gliding down the block, with a team of Latino workers tending to landscaping along the sidewalk.
“They still moved to a two-story house in Santa Monica,” said Taylor Brinckerhoff, a family friend of the Millers’ who often attended Passover dinners with them.
For fellow students, the most credible origin story for Mr. Miller remains the simplest.
Surely he believed what he was saying, or at least most of it. But he also seemed to grasp quickly that contrarianism could be its own reward in an ecosystem of the like-minded, a way to stand out among the egos and trust funds of a singular American school district.
“Confrontation was his sort of modus operandi,” said Mr. Rosmarin, the former Santa Monica high school newspaper editor, who now works for the American Civil Liberties Union. “I think it’s why he came to school in the morning.”
And there is little doubt that he subscribed early to a future tenet of Breitbart-era conservatism: If you are upsetting liberals, you are probably doing something right.
“That was you?” Andrew Breitbart, the founder of the far-right website that bears his name, asked Mr. Miller in 2011, according to three people present for the exchange, during a gathering at the Breitbart townhouse beside the Supreme Court.
When Mr. Miller’s history was mentioned, these people said, Mr. Breitbart instantly recalled the California teenager who had become something of a cult figure in right-wing news media for laying verbal waste to his high school.
Duke, and on to Washington
The megaphones only got louder, a function of timing and gumption.
As a student at Duke University, when the school became a national political minefield in 2006 after a black woman accused three white lacrosse players of rape, Mr. Miller sensed an opportunity.

Where most students and professors sided quickly with the alleged victim, Mr. Miller became the players’ most vocal defender on cable television, appearing on Fox News to accuse the prosecutor of a witch hunt long before the case collapsed.
“We are at a terrible dearth of intelligent, common-sense, courageous voices on campus,” Mr. Miller, then a senior, told Bill O’Reilly on his Fox show, taking something of a victory lap.

After graduating, Mr. Miller moved to Washington to work as press secretary for Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. By 2009, he found his way to Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama (Mr. Horowitz, the author, had introduced them), and he was eventually elevated to Mr. Sessions’s communications director.
In their years together, Mr. Miller positioned himself — and helped position Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general — inside the Republican Party’s burgeoning Breitbart wing, seizing on immigration as a central issue while bipartisan immigration legislation slithered through Congress in 2013.
Mr. Miller also found common cause with Mr. Bannon, who hoped to fashion the Breitbart News site into a battlefield for the so-called alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that often embraces an ideology of white nationalism. In 2014, the two helped propel a nearly anonymous House candidate in Virginia, Dave Brat, to a primary election victory over Eric Cantor, the majority leader at the time, in part by hammering Mr. Cantor as overly tolerant of illegal immigration. The race in many ways presaged the campaign of Mr. Trump, whose prospects Mr. Miller soon eyed with excitement.
“Trump gets it,” Mr. Miller wrote to friends weeks later, forwarding a Breitbart interview with Mr. Trump, who concluded that Mr. Cantor’s defeat owed to “his softness on immigration.”
“I wish he’d run for president,” Mr. Miller added of Mr. Trump.
When he did, Mr. Miller joined him early, before a vote had been cast in the primaries — and before Mr. Sessions became Mr. Trump’s most significant elected supporter. At rallies, Mr. Miller often warmed up crowds in his dark suits, his receding hairline slicked back. “We’re going to build that wall, and we’re going to build it out of love!” Mr. Miller promised.
Mr. Miller quickly grew comfortable with Mr. Trump’s impromptu style during the campaign, on more than one occasion ripping up a completed speech in the back of the candidate’s black S.U.V. because Mr. Trump had a change of heart on the way to an event.

And people close to both men say that more than anyone, Mr. Miller has grasped how to fuse the cadences of Mr. Trump’s own plain-spoken language with something loftier, at times scribbling notes on a piece of paper pressed to the side of a car window as he jotted down the president’s thoughts.
Occasionally, Mr. Miller has retained a public-facing role. In August, when the administration announced its support for a proposal to slash legal immigration, the White House briefing room belonged to him.
By the time the news conference was over, Mr. Miller had sparred with The New York Times, accused a CNN reporter of “cosmopolitan bias” and suggested that the poem associated with the Statue of Liberty (“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses”) should not inform American immigration policy because it was not added to Liberty Island until 17 years after the statue’s unveiling.
As he spoke, Ms. Sanders, the press secretary, inched closer, sensing it was time to reclaim the microphone. But Mr. Miller seemed tickled by the combat.
“I think that went exactly as planned,” Mr. Miller said coyly, finally ceding the stage. “I think that was exactly what we were hoping to have happen.”"

Let's paint about sex: racy feminist artists enjoy mainstream success,"LONDON (Reuters) - A three-foot phallus in a child’s dress seems like an unlikely symbol of female empowerment, but for artist Renate Bertlmann its presence at a major art show is a sign she has gained an acceptance denied her for decades.
Bertlmann, 74, is one an all-female group of artists featured in a new section of this year’s London’s Frieze art fair that focuses on feminist artists whose overt sexual themes saw them censored and excluded from mainstream shows in the past.
“My work was really rejected in the 70s and into the 80s because people were afraid of my topics: sexuality, religion, feminism. It took obviously 40, 50 years that they recognize that the works are worth looking at,” Bertlmann told Reuters.
“I appreciate very much that I get wonderful exhibitions, or I‘m shown here in Frieze. Ten years ago it would have been impossible.”
The London Frieze is a commercial art fair that features exhibitions by over 160 international galleries and 1,000 artists.
“Sex Work: Feminist Art & Radical Politics” is the name of the section included this year that features works including casts of intimate body parts and images of sexually explicit cakes.
Despite the artists’ feminist agenda, many found that they were not embraced by the feminist movements of their day.
“I was somewhat on the fringe always, and, I think, a bit questionable to some of the more militant feminists, because I was bringing my sexuality to the table,” artist Penny Slinger said.
Highlighting the increasing mainstream acceptance of sexually explicit feminist art - four works from the exhibition were acquired for the collection of Britain’s Tate museum.
“The question now is if this will be seen more broadly as important art and not ‘important art with a feminist asterisk’, but I think that is happening,” said gallery owner David Lewis, who sold the Tate one of the works it acquired this week, a collage by artist Mary Beth Edelson.
The fair runs until Oct. 8.

Mexican mogul Slim donates $105 million to earthquake recovery efforts,"Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim talks during a news conference to discuss his foundation's work in supporting efforts at rebuilding areas damaged by the massive earthquake on Sept. 19. in Mexico City, Mexico October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican mogul Carlos Slim’s foundation will donate more than $105 million (1.978 billion pesos) to help the country recover from two large earthquakes in September, Slim announced on Tuesday.
The Carlos Slim Foundation also collected more than $21 million dollars (395.6 million pesos) from outside donors, raising the total contribution to more than $126 million (2.373 billion pesos).
More than 217,000 donors participated in the effort, Slim said. The gift comes from the foundation’s endowment, Slim added.
On Sept. 19, central Mexico was struck by an earthquake that measured 7.1 on the U.S. Geological Survey scale, level ling dozens of buildings and killing at least 369 people, making it the deadliest temblor in a generation. The earthquake came less than two weeks after an 8.1 quake struck southern Mexico, killing at least 98 people.
Estimates of the cost of rebuilding range from about $2 billion, according to the government, to as much as $4 billion, a calculation by investment bank Nomura.
Speaking at a press conference in Mexico City on Tuesday, Slim said the group will focus its efforts on rebuilding schools, reinforcing historic buildings and assisting hospitals. He voiced optimism about the effects the reconstruction efforts could have for the Mexican economy.
“I think it will be a very good factor, a big factor of employment in all of the affected zones,” he said.
America Movil, Latin America’s largest telecommunications firm by number of subscribers, is the crown jewel of Slim’s empire, which also includes retailer Grupo Sanborns and commercial banking company Grupo Inbursa."
Switch IPO the latest to limit investor voting rights,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When data center operator Switch Inc goes public on Friday it will be the latest tech firm using special shares to limit the rights of minority investors, making it ineligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 under new rules meant to deter such practices.
The Las Vegas company, run by enigmatic founder and Chief Executive Officer Rob Roy, plans to sell 31.3 million shares in an initial public offer late on Thursday for between $14 and $16 a piece, which would raise nearly $500 million and make it the largest technology listing this year after Snap Inc .
Underwriters closed their order book late on Wednesday and the deal was oversubscribed, according to a source close to the IPO.
Roy, who describes himself as an “inventrepreneur” and “tech futurist,” will have 68 percent of voting power following the IPO, thanks to a special share class providing 10 votes per share.
That will keep Switch out of the S&P 500 and other related indexes under new rules instituted by S&P Dow Jones in July after Snap sold shares without any voting rights in its $3.4 billion IPO earlier this year.
Rule changes enacted last month for FTSE Russell indexes, also in reaction to Snap, require new constituents of its indexes to have at least 5 percent of their voting rights in the hands of public shareholders.
The shares being sold in Switch’s IPO will include 4.9 percent of the company’s voting rights, or 5.6 percent if underwriters exercise an option to buy additional shares.
In its IPO filing and a profile of Roy on the company website, Switch gives no details about what he did before founding the company in 2000 or his academic qualifications. The profile describes him as “a recognized expert in advanced end-to-end solutions for mission-critical facilities.”
A company spokesman declined to provide additional information about Roy, and he does not appear in a 38-minute video marketing the IPO.
The IPO could value Switch, which operates three data centers in Michigan and Nevada, at almost $4 billion.
Snap co-founder Evan Spiegel was well known to Wall Street ahead of the Snapchat-owner’s February share offer, with many investors essentially betting on his talent. With Roy less known, investors may be taking a greater risk on a company in which they will have little say.
“Investors do look at voting control as well as the price you pay. If you put so much stock in the CEO, normally he’s going to part of the sales pitch for the company,” said Ken Bertsch, Executive Director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents top U.S. pension funds.
As many of 15 percent of U.S. IPOs in recent years have used dual share classes meant to give insiders outsized voting rights, according to the Council of Institutional Investors.
Inclusion in a stock index can be an important milestone for young companies, bringing their shares into many passive funds and others that closely follow indexes like the S&P 500, a guide for trillions of dollars of capital worldwide.
Other companies excluded from major indexes under their new rules include video-streaming company Roku Inc , whose IPO last week kept 97 percent of voting power with insiders. Software seller Mulesoft Inc’s IPO in February included a share class with 10 votes per share, as did Blue Apron Holdings Inc in its June debut.
Suggesting that the tide may be turning toward sharing power with minority investors, privately-held ride-hailing company Uber on Tuesday said it would abandon a dual share class system that favored insiders including former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick.
Responding to a shareholder lawsuit, Facebook Inc in September gave up plans for a new class of stock that was meant to be a way for Mark Zuckerberg to retain control over the company he founded while fulfilling a pledge to give away his wealth.

"'Ball in your court:' Britain, EU clash over next Brexit move","LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and its European Union partners clashed on Monday over which side should make the next move to unblock Brexit talks, despite concerns they will miss a deadline for a divorce deal and that London is heading for a chaotic departure.
Prime Minister Theresa May made clear in a speech she delivered to parliament that she hoped her EU partners would make proposals at a new round of talks opening the way to the next stage of negotiations, saying “the ball is in their court”.
But even before she had delivered her address, an EU spokesman hit back in Brussels, saying “the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen”.
May is desperate to try to regain some of her authority and refocus on talks to unravel 40 years of union after a speech at her party conference last week, marred by a repetitive cough, a prankster and a stage malfunction, left her weaker than ever.
She has so far fought off attempts to unseat her by critics already angry over an ill-judged election when she lost her governing Conservatives’ majority. But her weakness has opened the door for many in the party to challenge her Brexit strategy with just 18 months to go before Britain leaves the EU.
With Brussels quietly preparing for a collapse in the talks and Britain getting ready for what May calls “every eventuality”, some officials and business chiefs worry the country will crash out of the EU without a deal.
Speaking in parliament, May said her negotiators had made progress on the first phase of talks, tackling the rights of expatriates and the border with EU-member Ireland, and that she was determined to secure a new partnership with the other 27 members of the wealthy political and trade bloc.
“Achieving that partnership will require leadership and flexibility, not just from us but from our friends, the 27 nations of the EU,” she told a raucous session of parliament.
“And as we look forward to the next stage, the ball is in their court. But I am optimistic we will receive a positive response.”
But the EU stuck to its terms: “There is a clear sequencing to these talks and there has been so far no solution found on step one, which is the divorce proceedings,” European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular briefing. “So the ball is entirely in the UK court for the rest to happen.”
“SEE WHAT HAPPENS”
May, who hosted businesses on Monday to listen to their Brexit concerns, is keen to push the talks beyond a discussion of the divorce to try to offer firms some certainty about future trading conditions.

According to a source familiar with the matter, May told business leaders that for her, a roughly two-year transitional agreement was non-negotiable. “It will happen,” the source said when asked what May had spoken about.
She also said her government had no intention of revoking Article 50, which triggered the Brexit talks in March this year, and stopping Britain’s departure.
But a lack of progress in talks some 15 months after Britain voted to leave the EU in a referendum has added pressure on May, who was criticized by the opposition for failing to offer any clarity on what the future relationship will look like.
“Now the reality for this Tory (Conservative) government is beginning to bite, but if things do not improve, the reality may soon begin to bite for the jobs and living standards of the people of this country,” said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party.

A report that aerospace manufacturer BAE Systems (BAES.L) is planning to cut more than 1,000 jobs did little to ease those concerns that without progress in the talks, firms will start to make staffing and relocation decisions.
EU negotiators say that while they see no big breakthrough at the summit next week, they may offer May a hand by offering hope of a shift at the next scheduled meeting in mid-December.
Aides to May have signaled that the prime minister has accepted that her October deadline will not be met despite a speech in Italy last month which attempted to reset the tone of the difficult negotiations.
But some pro-Brexit campaigners are calling on the prime minister to get ready to step away from the talks - underlining the deep divisions in the Conservative Party.
Those differences were aired again on Monday with negative briefings in the local media against finance minister Philip Hammond, who supports prolonging the status quo with the EU for as long as possible, and foreign minister Boris Johnson, who angered some Conservatives for setting his own Brexit red lines.
Some have suggested that May will reshuffle her cabinet, but her spokesman said she had full confidence in both ministers.
“We are fast reaching the point when the prime minister should assert the authority of her office over the negotiations and call time,” Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative lawmaker, wrote in the Guardian newspaper.
John Baron, another pro-Brexit campaigner, called on the government to “prepare more thoroughly for a ‘no deal’”.
“I have long believed that the EU Commission primarily wants to punish Britain for daring to leave the organization,” he said. “We should have no fears about a ‘no deal’ scenario.”

Kobe Steel crisis deepens as more data tampering revealed; shares tumble,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Kobe Steel Ltd (5406.T) plunged deeper into crisis on Wednesday as fresh revelations showed data fabrication at the steelmaker was more widespread than initially thought, heightening a safety scare along the global supply chain.
Investors, worried about the financial impact and potential legal fallout, again dumped Kobe Steel stock, wiping about $1.6 billion off its market value in two days.
Kobe Steel said late on Wednesday it found 70 cases of tampered data on materials used in optical disks and liquid crystal displays at its Kobelco Research Institute Inc, which makes and tests products for the company. It also found one case of falsified data on iron powder products shipped to a customer.
An internal probe carried out since it found issues in its aluminum and copper business has not found other cases of data tampering, Yoshihiko Katsukawa, a managing executive officer at Kobe Steel, told a news conference.
He said the company - which has said it was examining possible data falsifications going back 10 years - has begun an external investigation of all its units, including those overseas.
“We can’t rule out the possibility that the external investigation will find other cases,” Katsukawa said, adding no customers had raised any safety issues or stopped buying its products.
One customer, Central Japan Railway (9022.T), said some parts it received from Kobe Steel for its bullet trains did not meet Japanese Industrial Standards, but there were no safety issues.
Kobe Steel President Hiroya Kawasaki will meet a senior official at the industry ministry on Thursday, the ministry said in a statement.
The new revelations come after Kobe Steel admitted at the weekend it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products used in cars, aircraft, space rockets and defense equipment - a fresh blow to Japanese manufacturers’ reputation for quality production.
There have been previous cases in Japan involving falsified data, including at Nissan Motor (7201.T), Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) and Takata, which filed for bankruptcy this year over faulty airbags that were blamed for 17 deaths and scores of injuries.
In 2015, it was revealed that Toyo Tire & Rubber (5105.T) fabricated data to secure government approval for materials to absorb shocks from earthquakes. Conglomerate Toshiba Corp (6502.T) is still battling the fallout of a scandal over reporting inflated profits.

The corrosive business practices have raised broader questions over corporate governance in Japan, and cast doubt on the integrity of a manufacturing industry once the envy of the world.
“The scandal looks similar to that of Toyo Tire, and not as massive (or) devastating as Takata‘s. Kobe Steel’s technology is not something easily substitutable by others, and existing customers have nowhere else to go,” said Yasuo Sakuma, Chief Investment Officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo.
Kobe Steel faces potential costs from any product recalls, replacements and possible litigation, including class-action suits in the United States, Yuji Matsumoto, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said in a report.
The data tampering at its aluminum unit could also hit plans to expand the business as carmakers increasingly turn to the material, which is lighter than steel, to meet tighter environmental rules.

“Aluminum is one of Kobe Steel’s key focus areas in the medium term as part of its strategy to help lighten vehicles, (and) this will certainly have a negative impact on the expansion,” Matsumoto noted.
Multinationals including Toyota Motor (7203.T), Ford Motor (F.N) and planemakers Boeing (BA.N) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) have said they are investigating the safety of products from Kobe Steel.
REPEAT OFFENDER?
It’s not the first time Kobe Steel has been caught up in falsifying data.
In June of last year, it said an affiliate, Shinko Wire Stainless Co, falsified data on tests for tensile strength of some stainless steel wire for springs over a period of more than nine years. And in 2006, Kobe Steel said its Kakogawa steelworks in western Japan falsified soot emissions data over five years.
In a statement on Wednesday, Kobe Steel denied a Nikkei business daily report that it intended to put its real estate business up for sale to help shore up its finances. The company said it was assessing its options.
The steelmaker reported losses in the last two financial years, but has said it expects to return to profit this year.
Sales at Kobe Steel’s aluminum and copper division fell 6.4 percent to 323.3 billion yen ($2.9 billion) in the year to March, and recurring profit dropped by more than a fifth to 12 billion yen."

LONDON (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who has served as acting president for much of this year, said on Monday he had not given any thought to contesting the country’s next presidential election in 2019.
Nigeria has faced heightened uncertainty over whether President Muhammadu Buhari plans to contest the next election. Buhari, 74, took power in 2015 but has been absent for much of this year due to illness.
Osinbajo, a 60-year-old law professor, served as acting president during Buhari’s absences, succeeding in calming tensions in the oil-producing Delta region and pushing small steps to improve the business climate, including foreign currency reforms. Some business leaders say he could provide stability by running for president himself in Feb 2019.
Asked at the FT Africa Summit in London if he had considered running, Osinbajo said he hadn’t thought about it, adding: “None of that is on the cards”.
Osinbajo also said that militants in the oil-producing Niger Delta region no longer posed a significant threat to oil production.
He said Nigeria had lost as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil production last year amid militant attacks on oil and gas infrastructure, which is concentrated in the southern Delta region. It was now pumping roughly 1.85 million bpd and climbing toward 2 million bpd. That is closer to its top production of around 2.2 million bpd.
Still, he added that Nigeria needed to diversify its oil-dependent economy and take advantage of the resource while it was still in high demand.
“We don’t have all the time in the world with oil,” he said. “We have to use oil while it makes sense to do so.”

"Gov’t Ruined 653,249 Lives Over Cannabis in 2016 Because 5 Corrupt Industries Paid Them To","By Matt Agorist
In the land of the free, citizens found in possession of a plant — that grows wild on every continent except Antarctica — can and will be kidnapped, caged or killed. In fact, in just the short time it took you to click this article and read this first paragraph, someone was just arrested for cannabis.
According to the most recent FBI statistics available, an American citizen is kidnapped and caged for cannabis — on average — every 48 seconds.
An estimated 653,249 American citizens — who harmed no one — had their lives ruined in 2016 for possessing this plant, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s annual Crime In the United States (CIUS) report.
“Arresting and citing over half a million people a year for a substance that is objectively safer than alcohol is a travesty,” said Morgan Fox, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP). “Despite a steady shift in public opinion away from marijuana prohibition, and the growing number of states that are regulating marijuana like alcohol, marijuana consumers continue to be treated like criminals throughout the country. This is a shameful waste of resources and can create lifelong consequences for the people arrested.”
Arresting people for cannabis is good for business — police state and big pharma business, that is. If we look at who’s lobbying to keep cops kidnapping people for a plant, we see that it is money, and not morals, that motivates this issue.
The prison-industrial complex makes obscene amounts of money kidnapping otherwise innocent people and throwing them in a cage for possessing a plant. Big pharma is also scared to death of pot because it is a cheaper, safer, and often more effective solution to sicknesses than their chemical alternatives.
According to a report out of US News, lobbyists work hard to secure for police departments millions of dollars in federal grants towards eradicating weed. Pharmaceutical companies compensate leading anti-marijuana researchers in order to keep their customers on painkillers over cannabis, which is cheaper. The prison-industrial complex would like to keep making money on building more prisons to fill with non-violent grass-smokers.
It’s not just cops and big pharma either, legal drug distributors in the alcohol and tobacco industries need to keep cannabis illegal in order maintain their monopoly on ‘taking the edge off.’
According to the report, the alcohol and beer industries have also lobbied for years to keep marijuana illegal because they fear the competition that legalized weed would bring. Howard Wooldridge, an anti-drug war activist and retired cop told the online publication Republic Report: “Marijuana and alcohol compete right today as a product to take the edge off the day at six o’clock.”
Despite the myriad of evidence showing the harmful economic and societal impacts of arresting people for cannabis, cops, prisons, big pharma, and the alcohol and tobacco industries continue to push for illegal weed. As they lie about arresting people for a plant in your best interests, the police state is wreaking havoc on liberty, freedom, and the economy. It is deadly, too.
While there’s never been a documented overdose from cannabis, if the CDC calculated the number of deaths inflicted by police while enforcing marijuana laws, that number would certainly be shocking and could even be deemed a risk to public health. Marijuana is, indeed, dangerous, but only because of what can happen to you if the police catch you with it — just ask the 653,249 people who had their lives ruined for it last year.
Nothing highlights the hypocrisy, immorality, and sheer idiocy of the drug war quite like marijuana prohibition. Here we have a medicine that kills cancer cells, saves the lives of countless epileptic children, heals broken bones, relieves pain, treats PTSD, is not dangerous, and exhibits a variety of other incredible benefits – yet the State will kill you over it.
Keeping cannabis illegal also creates more crime.
In the study, titled, “Going to pot? The impact of dispensary closures on crime,” researchers Tom Y. Chang from the USC Marshall School of Business, and Mireille Jacobson from The Paul Merage School of Business at UC Irvine, looked at what happens with the government forced medical marijuana dispensaries to close. What they found was immediately following a closure of a dispensary — crime rates went up.
“Contrary to popular wisdom, we found an immediate increase in crime around dispensaries ordered to close relative to those allowed to remain open,” Jacobson told Science Daily.
Also, in 2001, the Portuguese government decriminalized all drugs, and their crime rate dropped. Sixteen years later, drug use, crime, and overdoses have drastically declined in Portugal exposing the cruel reality of prohibition.
“Regulating marijuana for adults creates jobs, generates tax revenue, protects consumers, and takes money away from criminals,” Fox said on behalf of MPP. “It is time for the federal government and the rest of the states to stop ruining peoples’ lives and enact sensible marijuana policies.”
We agree.
The good news is that the tide is shifting. As MPP notes, there are currently eight states that regulate marijuana similarly to alcohol for adults, four of which voted to do so in November 2016. Marijuana possession is also legal for adults in the District of Columbia. Twenty-three states and D.C. considered legislation in 2017 to regulate marijuana, including in Vermont where the legislature approved such a measure before the governor vetoed it.
As more and more states refuse to kidnap and cage marijuana users, the drug war will continue to implode. We must be resilient in this fight.
If doing drugs bothers you, don’t do drugs. When you transition from holding an opinion — to using government violence to enforce your personal preference, you become the bad guy. Please, for all that is good, don’t be the bad guy and do your part to stay on the right side of history.

"Cutch Rocks, Bucs Roll 10-1","Cutch Rocks, Bucs Roll 10-1
(Before It's News)
Trevo got off on the right foot. After tossing a scoreless frame, he watched a Starling single and back-to-back-doubles by Cutch & J-Bell gave him a quick two-run pad. It would grow. In the second, the Bucs had two outs and Mad Max aboard when a Fraze double and Starling walk packed the sacks for Cutch. It is a well-known bit of Pirates lore that in nine seasons, Andrew has never drilled a grand slam. That can now be crossed off his to-do list; let the record show he got #1 off Kevin Gausman to make it 6-0. Cutch said “finally” as he hopped on the plate and the fans knew the history, too, demanding a curtain call. It stayed that way into the bottom of the fifth when Jimmy Yacabonis took the ball from Gausman. The Bucs used three singles to add one more chip to the pot (actually a bummer as they has the bases jammed w/no outs, but today, not a big deal).
Pretty good night for this dude (photo Pittsburgh Pirates)
The Birds got on the board when Chris Davis banged a two-out homer in the sixth. The Bucs had an answer – Fraze and Starling singled and Andrew, who is a triple shy of the cycle, banged another homer to make it 10-1. Cutch was pulled for J-Lup after taking the field in the seventh so that he could draw some final crowd love (pro move by Clint). Steven Brault toed the rubber and took it home from there, earning his first save in the process by tossing three frames.
Cutch happened, the pitching of Trevor Williams & Steven Brault speaks well for the future, and the Bucs are one game away from closing out the 2017 home card.
But an even better one for this guy… (photo Dave Arrigo/Pirates)
Notes:
Cutch had four hits; Fraze and Starling had two each and scored five times (it’s good to bat ahead of Andrew); J-Bell also had two knocks.
Per @theaceofspaeder: Cutch is the first #Pirates player with at least four runs and eight RBI in a game since Ralph Kiner on June 25, 1950.
Andrew chased home a career-high eight runners tonight, a feat that hasn’t been done since since Jason Bay did it in 2004 (Johnny Rizzo set the team record in 1939 with nine; Bay drove in eight twice while Ralph Kiner & Dave Robertson each did it once). Cutch passed Al “Scoops” Oliver and Max Carey for 11th in all-time Bucco RBIs w/724 (Dave “The Cobra” Parker is 10th w/758).
Trevor was sharp again – six IP, one run, three hits, one walk and six K while serving 93 pitches.
There were 19,318 at the ol’ ballyard tonight.

By Brady Kenyon
British tennis star Dan Evans has been banned from competition for one year following a positive drug test for cocaine. Evans is currently the number 4 ranked British player. Evans will be allowed to return to competition April 24, 2018. The Guardian reports, The 27-year-old tested positive for cocaine during the Barcelona Open in April this year but the ITF said in a statement it accepted “inadvertent contamination” was to blame for the positive test and that Evans bore “no significant fault or negligence”. Evans, however, admitted to using cocaine when he was not competing four days before the test was taken. He claimed to have put a small amount of “leftover cocaine” first in his trouser pocket then in his washbag before discarding it the next day. Evans, who was world No50 before his positive test, has also had to give back the £92,205 of prize money won and the ranking points gained between the date of his test and the announcement of the positive finding on 23 June. Britains No1 Andy Murray spoke out over the controversy stating ; “I have obviously spent a reasonable amount of time with Dan over the last couple of years. He put himself in a …

How a businessman struck a deal with Islamic State to help Assad feed Syrians,"A woman pushes a cart loaded with a sack of wheat in Qamishli, Syria September 18, 2017. Picture taken September 18, 2017. REUTERS/Rodi Said
RAQQA/DUBAI (Reuters) - While Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was accusing the West of turning a blind eye to Islamic State smuggling, a member of his parliament was quietly doing business with the group, farmers and administrators in the militants’ former stronghold said.
The arrangement helped the Syrian government to feed areas still under its control after Islamic State took over the northeastern wheat-growing region during the six-year-old civil war, they said.
Traders working for businessman and lawmaker Hossam al-Katerji bought wheat from farmers in Islamic State areas and transported it to Damascus, allowing the group to take a cut, five farmers and two administrators in Raqqa province told Reuters.
Katerji’s office manager, Mohammed Kassab, confirmed that Katerji Group was providing Syrian government territories with wheat from the northeast of Syria through Islamic State territory but denied any contact with Islamic State. It is not clear how much Assad knew of the wheat trading.
Cooperation over wheat between a figure from Syria’s establishment, which is backed by Shi‘ite power Iran, and the hardline Sunni Islamic State would mark a new ironic twist in a war that has deepened regional Sunni-Shi‘ite divisions.
Reuters contacted Katerji’s office six times to request comment but was not given access to him.
His office manager Kassab, asked how the company managed to buy and transport the wheat without any contact with Islamic State, said: “It was not easy, the situation was very difficult.” When asked for details he said only that it was a long explanation. He did not return further calls or messages.
Damascus, under U.S. and EU sanctions over the conflict and alleged oil trading with Islamic State, strongly denies any business links with the hardline Islamist militants, arguing that the United States is responsible for their rise to power.
The self-declared caliphate they set up across large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014 has all but collapsed after Western-backed forces drove them out of their Iraqi stronghold, Mosul and surrounded them in Raqqa, where they are now confined to a small area.
Russian and Iranian-backed Syrian forces are attacking them elsewhere, such as Deir al Zor on Syria’s eastern border, where Kassab says he was speaking from, in a continuing struggle for the upper hand between world powers.
TWENTY PERCENT
Five farmers in Raqqa described how they sold wheat to Katerji’s traders during Islamic State rule in interviews at the building housing the Raqqa Civil Council, formed to take over once the city is retaken.
“The operation was organized,” said Mahmoud al-Hadi, who owns agricultural land near Raqqa and who, like the other farmers, had come to the council’s cement offices to seek help.
“I would sell to small traders who sent the wheat to big traders who sent it on to Katerji and the regime through two or three traders,” he said.
He and the other farmers said they all had to pay Islamic State a 10 percent tax, or zakat, and sold all of their season’s supplies to Katerji’s traders under the multi-layered scheme.
Local officials said Katerji’s traders bought up wheat from Raqqa and Deir al-Zor and gave Islamic State 20 percent.
“If a truck is carrying 100 sacks, they (Islamic State) would keep 20 and give the rest to the trucker,” said Awas Ali, a deputy of the Tabqa joint leadership council, a similar, post-Islamic State local body allied to the Kurdish-led forces now attacking Raqqa.
Ali said he learned of the details of the arrangement with Katerji by speaking with Islamic State prisoners and others who worked in the group’s tax collection and road tolling systems.
“Katerji’s trucks were well known and the logo on them was clear and they were not harassed at all,” Ali said, adding that Katerji’s people were active during the last buying season, which lasts from May to August. The farmers also said the trucks were identifiable as Katerji‘s.
The truck drivers were even allowed to smoke cigarettes as they passed through the checkpoints, something Islamic State enforcers punished with whippings elsewhere, Ali and several other sources said.
“I would sell an entire season’s supplies to Katerji’s traders,” said farmer Ali Shanaan.
“They are known traders. The checkpoints stopped the trucks and Daesh would take a cut and let them pass,” he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
The wheat was transported via the “New bridge” over the Euphrates River to a road leading out of Raqqa, the farmers and local officials said. Control of the bridge is now unclear as the militants in Raqqa come close to defeat.
Raqqa-based lawyer Abdullah al-Aryan, who said he had been a consultant for some of Katerji’s traders, said Katerji’s trucks brought goods into Islamic State territory as well as wheat out.

“Food used to come from areas controlled by the government. Medicine and food,” he said.
Islamic State rule involved shooting or beheading perceived opponents in public squares, imposing its own extreme version of sharia, Islamic law, and then providing basic goods such as bread and setting up ministries and taxation.
Several farmers said they saw Islamic State documents which were stamped at checkpoints to allow the wheat trucks to pass. They belonged to the department which imposes taxes.
SMUGGLING
Islamic State may have exported some of the wheat. Local officials and farmers said the militants, as well as a rebel group, had sold the contents of grain silos in the northeast to traders across the Turkish border.
Assad has accused his enemies, including Turkey and Western countries, of supporting the group, something they deny.
In an interview in March with a Chinese news agency, published by Syrian state news agency SANA, Assad said:
“As for the other side, which is the United States, at least during the Obama administration, it dealt with Daesh through overlooking its smuggling of Syrian oil to Turkey, and in that way Daesh was able to procure money in order to recruit terrorists from all over the world.”

Asked whether Syrian companies were dealing with Islamic State to secure wheat, Internal Trade and Consumer Protection Minister Abdullah al-Gharbi said in August: “No, not at all.”
Speaking to Reuters at a Damascus trade fair, he added: “This doesn’t exist at all. We are importing wheat from Russian companies in addition to our local crop and this talk is completely unacceptable.”
The wheat buying season ended in August and IS has lost control of the wheat-growing areas, either to government forces or the Syrian Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces.
THE ONASSIS OF SYRIA
Assad has traditionally relied on a close-knit set of businessmen most notably Rami Makhlouf, his maternal cousin, to help keep Syria’s economy afloat.
Makhlouf is subject to international sanctions and relies on various associates to do business.
Katerji is a household name around Raqqa and elsewhere. Farmer Hadi likened him to a late Greek shipping tycoon, Aristotle Onassis. “Katerji is the Onassis of Syria,” he said.
Katerji’s facebook profile page shows him shaking hands with Assad and he regularly posts pictures of the president, who he describes as “a beacon of light for pan-Arabism, patriotism and loyalty”.
He is member of parliament for Aleppo, a key battleground recovered by the government late last year, and is part of a new business class that has risen to prominence during the war.
The United States and EU have imposed a range of measures targeted both at the government and some of the many armed groups operating in Syria, but foodstuffs are not restricted.
U.S. and European sanctions on banking and asset freezes have, however, made it difficult for most trading houses to do business with Assad’s government and made local supplies increasingly vital.
Flat bread is a subsidized staple for Syrians, who have suffered under a conflict estimated to have killed several hundred thousand people and forced millions to flee their homes.
The government needs around 1.5 million tonnes annually to feed the areas it controls and keep Syrians on Assad’s side.
Syria’s bread-basket provinces of Hasaka, Raqqa and Deir al-Zor account for nearly 70 percent of total wheat production.
While the government looks set to retake much of Deir al-Zor province soon, Hasaka is mostly under the control of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, who are also likely to hold sway in Raqqa along with Arab allied groups.
Ali, from the Tabqa council, predicted that would not stop the wheat trade. “People like Katerji, with a lot of money and power, their activities will never be completely frozen,” he said. “It is just going to disappear from one area and go to another.”"
Timol inquest: Verdict gives hope to apartheid victims,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Ahmed Timol's nephew, Imtiaz Cajee, testified to the pain of losing his uncle
The inquest into the 1971 death of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol has found that he was murdered, shattering a five-decade-long claim by security police that he had committed suicide.
In a packed courtroom, Judge Billy Mothle ruled that he ""was pushed"" out of the window of the 10th floor building where he had been detained by the apartheid police.
Applause rang out in court at the end of his ruling - vindication for the Timol family at last.
But what is the significant of the ruling for South Africa and other families who have lost loved ones in a similar way?
""After this ruling we are hoping to see large scale investigations,"" says Lawson Naidoo, head of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution.
Many of those who were with Mr Timol at the time have since died but the judge found that they were ""complicit"" in his death and recommended that prosecutions should follow because perjury had been committed by some former state security members who testified at this hearing.
And so for the first time in the history of its atrocities, it seemed as though the apartheid system of white minority rule was on trial in South Africa.
Reliving the past
The inquiry offered a rare glimpse into the gruesome workings of the racist regime - and demanded answers.
For those brief few weeks it was as though Mr Timol was speaking for himself - and on behalf of those who died like him.

Officially, police records say he leapt to his death from the infamous John Vorster Square, now called Johannesburg Central police station.
Mr Timol's family had for years campaigned for a new investigation, saying he was not ""one to give up"" - that he would have never taken his own life.
Many other families here have for decades struggled to make peace with the deaths of their loved ones - largely due to the secrecy around it.
Activists say that between 1963 and 1990, at least 73 anti-apartheid fighters people died in police detention, in some situation their deaths bore an uncanny resemblance to that of Mr Timol.
Still no-one was ever called to account - the murderers were faceless, protected by the state even after the advent of democracy in 1994.
For the Mabelane family, this case has inspired hope. Matthews, then aged 23, was said to have jumped to his death, like Mr Timol.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Lasch Mabelane and his father 95-year-old Phillip hope more investigations will follow
His older brother Lasch Mabelane tells me the family has for decades been haunted by not knowing what really happened to Matthews.
""The day before he died, the police came to my parents' home and told them they need to make an appointment if they want to see him. They said: 'Do you know you have a naughty child?' and said they would discipline him,"" he says.
""Many people like my brother supposedly jumped from the 10th floor, it's the same story - the same floor,"" he adds.
Other activists who died at John Vorster Square police station:
Wellington Tshazibane: Found hanging in his cell on 11 December 1976
Neil Aggett: Found hanging in his cell on 5 February 1982
Ernest Dipale: Found hanging in his cell three days after his second detention, died 5 August 1982
Stanza Bopape: Died of a heart attack after being subject to repeated electric shocks, on 5 June 1988
Clayton Sithole: Found hanging dead in his cell on 30 January 1990
""We've never believed that he killed himself, he loved life and loved his family. The pain of losing him changed all of us, especially my parents.""
His father, Phillip Mabelane is 95 years old and a widower - he believes his wife died of a broken heart.
""Our child died in a painful way. We were left with so many questions and couldn't even ask them. This trouble my wife until the end,"" he says.
""The apartheid police were known to be violent, you didn't ask questions, you just accepted what you were told. How can you ever find peace in a situation like that?"" he asks.
Taking secrets to the grave
Peace and stability in this country were paid for in blood and an unspoken vow by those who worked for the state to take secrets to the grave.
This country's vast landscape is dotted with the unmarked graves of apartheid activists. Dinner table conversations frequently drift into stories of exiles who disappeared without a trace - leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions.
Image copyright AFP Image caption John Vorster Square, now known as the Johannesburg Central Police Station was the sight of several assaults and deaths
The Timol inquest could forever change that legacy.
This was the first inquest in democratic South Africa to specifically look into apartheid deaths in police custody.
While an investigation into Mr Timol's death was conducted at the time, many had believed it was a cover-up for the abuses that were happening at the height of white minority rule.
The long-awaited proceedings took weeks to conclude but had many glued to TV screens as high-ranking security police officers, men who until now had lived in the shadows, testified about the torture of activists at the height of the fight for freedom here.
Their actions included severe beatings, electrocution and at times crushing testicles.
In August fresh eyes began looking at the evidence led in court.
Some of the expert witnesses testified that some of Mr Timol's injuries, his cracked skull, were not consistent with the conclusion the apartheid police had reached at the initial inquest back in 1971.
Files with evidence of his bludgeoned body told tales of assault, witnesses testified to seeing Mr Timol days before his death being escorted by the police in the corridors of the police station and that he could barely walk.
These records are some of what led to Judge Mothle's historic findings.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Many protests have been staged calling for an investigation into Steve Biko's death
Mr Timol isn't the only activist to die under suspicious circumstances - Steve Biko also died while in police detention, supposedly because he had been on a hunger strike. No explanation was ever given for the bruises on his body.
In the minds of many, Mr Biko was murdered.
Nkosinathi Biko, through the Steve Biko Foundation, says their research puts the deaths of high-profile detainees, including his father, at 160.
""Many of them have as a cause of death, suicide or slipped on a bar of soap, that sort of thing. So uncovering the truth is important not only for those families but for the country. It should be a national record,"" he told the BBC.
There have been attempts at unearthing the truth in democratic South Africa such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).
However, in recent years the TRC's failure to compel apartheid loyalists who testified at the commission to ""tell all"" has come in for increasing criticism, along with granting perpetrators amnesty for their testimony.
While the hearings were hailed as a necessary process to help move the country into a peaceful democracy, many said it denied justice to victims of apartheid.
In the minds of many, justice will only come if those behind the murders and torture are prosecuted and punished for their crimes.
""You cannot forgive what you do not know, what was never acknowledged. The people who killed our children must be made to tell the truth and face the consequences of their actions,"" says Mr Mabelane Snr."

President Trump focuses anti-media ire on NBC after Tillerson 'moron' report,"President Trump has a new #1 target in the media: NBC News.
On Wednesday NBC's news division published a story about what it said were Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's ""disputes and clashes with the White House.""
Minutes after Tillerson spoke in front of cameras to dispute portions of the story, Trump called on the network to apologize.
Unsurprisingly, the network shrugged off his Twitter demand.
""We stand by our reporting,"" an NBC News spokeswoman said.
It's the latest chapter in a lengthy book of the president's anti-media attacks.
Sometimes he complains in general terms about ""fake news"" when the coverage isn't as positive as he wants it to be. Other times he lobs insults at specific news outlets and journalists.
On Wednesday morning, all four of his statements on Twitter referred to ""fake"" news -- first about his trip to Puerto Rico and then about the Tillerson turmoil.

Some analysts have said Trump resorts to the ""fake news"" claim when times are particularly tough at the White House.
In this case, he directed his Twitter ire at NBC News about four hours after the news division published this: ""Tillerson's Fury at Trump Required an Intervention From Pence.""
The story said that Tillerson disparaged Trump as a ""moron"" after a meeting at the Pentagon in July.
Over the summer, Tillerson ""was on the verge of resigning,"" and ""Vice President Mike Pence counseled Tillerson"" about how to ease the tensions with the president, NBC reported.
The story cited ""multiple senior administration officials who were aware of the situation at the time.""
According to Carol Lee, who had the first of four bylines on the jointly-reported story, NBC ""spoke with a dozen people"" for it, including ""seven people"" who said 'he was close to resigning at that time.'""
Indeed, some details about Tillerson's dissatisfaction leaked out over the summer. CNN, NBC and other outlets reported that Tillerson's frustrations were mounting and that, in the words of CNN's John King, Tillerson might be looking for an ""exit strategy.""
In recent days, there has been even more speculation about a potential resignation, given how Trump has publicly undermined Tillerson on the subject of North Korea.
Then came NBC's story on Wednesday -- carefully timed for the morning news cycle.
The NBCNews.com story came out at 5:50 a.m. and made an immediate impact, particularly because of the ""moron"" quote. NBC's ""Today"" show aired a detailed segment about the news division's reporting.
Later in the morning, CNN independently confirmed the ""moron"" quote.
The State Department arranged a press availability for Tillerson, who has been known for keeping his distance from the press corps. While Tillerson prepared to step out and speak on live TV, Trump tweeted, ""NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!""
Trump, who worked for NBC for over a decade as the host of ""The Apprentice,"" has a keen interest in the TV ratings race.
But he's wrong about NBC's news viewership. In fact, the ratings for programs like ""NBC Nightly News"" and ""Today"" and quite strong, despite industry-wide changes in media consumption and TV viewing habits.
Tillerson spoke at 11 a.m. The headline, in the minds of many reporters, is that he did not deny calling Trump a ""moron."" He said he wouldn't deal with that kind of ""petty nonsense.""
Lee spoke right afterward on MSNBC: ""He denied that he was ever intending to resign. Our reporting shows that he absolutely intended to resign and was very frustrated in July. Interestingly, he did not deny calling the president a moron.""
Lee added: ""The question now is, was it enough for Donald Trump?""
Analysts elsewhere on television said that Tillerson seemed to be speaking to an ""audience of one,"" meaning President Trump, who was flying to Las Vegas at the time.
""Perhaps Tillerson thought this may be the best way to communicate with Trump,"" given that the president ""is a huge consumer of cable news,"" David Chalian said on CNN.
Trump weighed in again a few minutes later, saying ""The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!""
The story was not ""totally refuted,"" and NBC emphasized again that it was confident in its reporting.
""NBC News will not be issuing an apology to America,"" MSNBC anchor Hallie Jackson said on air.
NBC White House correspondent Peter Alexander had perhaps the pithiest response to the president's tweets about his network.
He retweeted the first barb and said, ""Thanks for watching."""
Texas Woman Claims She Became Pregnant After She Was Raped By The Family Pig,"Texas Woman Claims She Became Pregnant After She Was Raped By The Family Pig
 
Angie Houston recently told Ellis Country News that she expects to give birth to a baby pig.
 
Angie’s story, although strange, claims that she was assaulted and helpless one horrid night in her own home.
 
Angie reports that after a night of playing miniature golf, she came home and was attacked by a 400 pound boar named Pete.
 
Pete pounced on Houston, raping her and impregnating her.
 
“People think I’m crazy and need mental help because of my story,” Angie told Ellis Country News. “They asked how did the pig get my panties off to mount me? I wasn’t wearing any panties, that’s how! This pig been hot for me for years. Constantly sniffing at my genitals. He’s tried to rape me 100 times. This is just the first time he successfully got inside me.”
 
According to Angie’s family, her parents are supporting her claims.
 
“Angie knows she can’t have sex until she’s married and she promises she hasn’t,” her father, Don Houston, said. “Pete’s always been an ornery pig, so it’s not surprising he raped our daughter. After this incident, I butchered Pete out. The bacon I made him into is helping feed Angela and her baby. After all, she’s eating for two now and needs a lot of extra meat.”
 
Angie has refused to see an obstetrician to check her and the baby’s health or get a sonogram to see what the potential “big baby” might look like.
 
“I just want to wait and be surprised by what my baby looks like,” Angie said. “My hope is that it’s not a mutant pig of some kind and it just comes out looking like a normal human baby, which I feel, will be the case.”

"Oh, rats! Big tree-dwelling rodent found in Solomon Islands","An illustration of a new species, Uromys vika is shown in this illustration provided September 28, 2017. Courtesy Velizar Simeonovski/The Field Museum/Handout via REUTERS
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People living on the Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean long had spoken of a big, tree-dwelling rat called vika that inhabited the rainforest, but the remarkable rodent managed to elude scientists -- until now.
After searching for it for years with cameras mounted in trees and traps, scientists said they finally caught up with the rat on Vangunu Island, part of the Solomon Islands, spotting one as it emerged from a tree felled by loggers.
It instantly joined the list of the biggest rats in the world, weighing about four times more than an ordinary rat and measuring about 1-1/2 feet (about half a meter) long.
“Vika lives in a very thick, complex forest, and it is up in the canopy so it is difficult to find. It is also a rare species. It is likely there are not many of these rats left,” mammalogist Tyrone Lavery of the Field Museum in Chicago, who led the research, said on Thursday.
The orange-brown rat dines on nuts and fruit, has short ears, a smooth tail with very fine scales and wide feet that allow it to move through the forest canopy.
The rat is reputed to chew holes in coconuts to eat the inside. “I haven’t found proof of this yet, but I have found that they can eat a very thick-shelled nut called a ngali nut,” Lavery said.
A small number of rat species around the world rival vika’s size. Lavery said a vika relative also inhabiting the Solomon Islands, called Poncelet’s giant rat, is twice the size.
The world’s largest rodent is not a rat, but rather South America’s barrel-shaped capybara.
A phenomenon called the “island effect” may help account for the size of Vika and other big rat species in the Solomon Islands.
“The island effect, or island syndrome, relates to the effects living on an island has on the evolution of body size. On islands, small species such as rats, evolve to have larger body size, they attain higher population densities and they produce fewer offspring,” Lavery said.
“Vika also probably arrived on an island where there were no other large mammals living in the canopy eating fruits and nuts so the species evolved to fill this niche,” Lavery said.
Lavery said vika should be considered critically endangered, with logging threatening its habitat.
The research was published this week in the Journal of Mammalogy.

ChiCitySports Fantasy Review: Week 4 Fantasy Football Rankings,"ChiCitySports Fantasy Review: Week 4 Fantasy Football Rankings
(Before It's News)
So who saw the Jets beating the Dolphins, Buffalo taking down Denver and the absolute beatdown Jacksonville just put on Baltimore across the pond? Sure wasn’t me. Just as unpredictable as the game itself, week 3 provided quite the list of major performances across the league: Stefon Diggs and Case Keenum dazzled against Tampa Bay, Chris Thompson made the most of his game against Oakland and in his first game of the season, Marcedes Lewis found the endzone in three times. If you managed to start all of these players last week, please show me your ways. In the meantime, let’s take a look at what Week 4 has in store for your fantasy matchups. Quarterback Fool me once, fool me twice with Cam Newton this season. After botching a prime matchup with the Saints, it’s safe to say the former NFL MVP is not quarterback he once was. He’s outside of my top 20 this week thanks to his early season performances. Meanwhile on the top half, the top four reign supreme again as they all enter the week with favorable matchups. Rodgers draws the Bears on Thursday night, and while Chicago got the best of the Green and Gold last time they played on a Thursday night, the Packers’ QB has thrown for 3+ touchdowns in four of their last six meetings. Past the top tier, the resurrection of Andy Dalton should continue this week against a bad Browns defense that just made Jacoby Brissett look like a pro bowler. Jay Cutler has his shot against the Saints. We’ll see if Newton was the outlier in regards to facing New Orleans.
Rank Name Team Opp 1 Tom Brady NE vs. CAR 2 Aaron Rodgers GB vs. CHI 3 Drew Brees NO at MIA 4 Matt Ryan ATL vs. BUF 5 Russell Wilson SEA vs. IND 6 Marcus Mariota TEN at HOU 7 Kirk Cousins WAS at KC 8 Philip Rivers LAC vs. PHI 9 Matthew Stafford DET at MIN 10 Dak Prescott DAL vs. LAR 11 Jameis Winston TB vs. NYG 12 Andy Dalton CIN at CLE 13 Ben Roethlisberger PIT at BAL 14 Carson Palmer ARI vs. SF 15 Derek Carr OAK at DEN 16 Trevor Siemian DEN vs. OAK 17 Alex Smith KC vs. WAS 18 Jay Cutler MIA vs. NO 19 Carson Wentz PHI at LAC 20 Tyrod Taylor BUF at ATL 21 Cam Newton CAR at NE 22 Deshaun Watson HOU vs. TEN 23 Jared Goff LAR at DAL 24 Eli Manning NYG at TB 25 Blake Bortles JAC at NYJ
Running Back I said it last week, I’ll say it again: all aboard the Kareem Hunt bandwagon! Hunt is well on his way to rookie of the year honors with no end in sight. The two right behind him in Elliott and Gurley are just as worthy of that #1 slot so you can’t go wrong among the top three here. Jordan Howard is the questionable play in the RB2 tier depending on how well his shoulder will do on short rest. Playing through the pain against Pittsburgh helped Chicago notch the victory, but at what price did it come? Yes, Mark Ingram looks to be the guy in New Orleans but I’m not sold just yet. It wouldn’t surprise me if Alvin Kamara works his way into the gameplan putting Ingram’s chances at fully breaking away from the pack on hold.
Rank Name Team Opp 1 Kareem Hunt KC vs. WAS 2 Ezekiel Elliott DAL vs. LAR 3 Todd Gurley LAR at DAL 4 Le’Veon Bell PIT at BAL 5 Jay Ajayi MIA vs. NO 6 LeSean McCoy BUF at ATL 7 Devonta Freeman ATL vs. BUF 8 Dalvin Cook MIN vs. DET 9 Leonard Fournette JAC at NYJ 10 Ty Montgomery GB vs. CHI 11 Carlos Hyde SF at ARI 12 Melvin Gordon LAC vs. PHI 13 Jordan Howard CHI at GB 14 C.J.

Wide Receiver The top three for this week got back to their dominant ways in Week 3 and should continue to do so this week. Considering what we mentioned above with the Browns making Jacoby Brissett look like a pro bowler, T.Y. Hilton reaped the benefits as should A.J. Green from Andy Dalton this week. DeVante Parker may be in for a huge week against the Saints. As the Jay we’ve all come to know and love, Parker’s QB has locked on to the young receiver early on this season providing plenty of opportunities. The 20s in this week’s rankings are chock full of opportunity between Tate, Cooper, Bryant and Hogan among others. It’s safe to say wide receiver is once again pulling away from the pack as the deepest position in the game yet again.
Rank Name Team Opp 1 Antonio Brown PIT at BAL 2 Odell Beckham Jr. NYG at TB 3 A.J.

Tight End Kudos to every fantasy owner out there that avoided the Week 3 minefield at tight end. Gronk produced like we expected and Ertz put up yet another impressive stat line earning them 1-2 in this week’s rankings, but past that was a hot mess. Kelce, Walker, Rudolph, Witten and Bennett did not show as expected, add in the annual injuries to Jordan Reed and Tyler Eifert and you have yourself a crapshoot. Charles Clay is quietly emerging as a top option at the tight end position and should get his fair share of opportunities if Buffalo falls behind in Atlanta. Once again it’s looking like we’ll be playing the mystery game between Antonio Gates and Hunter Henry in Los Angeles. Avoid this situation as much as possible.
Rank Name Team Opp 1 Rob Gronkowski NE vs. CAR 2 Zach Ertz PHI at LAC 3 Travis Kelce KC vs. WAS 4 Jimmy Graham SEA vs. IND 5 Delanie Walker TEN at HOU 6 Kyle Rudolph MIN vs. DET 7 Charles Clay BUF at ATL 8 Jordan Reed WAS at KC 9 Jason Witten DAL vs. LAR 10 Martellus Bennett GB vs. CHI 11 Eric Ebron DET at MIN 12 Evan Engram NYG at TB 13 Coby Fleener NO at MIA 14 Jared Cook OAK at DEN 15 Jack Doyle IND at SEA 16 Benjamin Watson BAL vs. PIT 17 Cameron Brate TB vs. NYG 18 Hunter Henry LAC vs. PHI 19 Austin Hooper ATL vs. BUF 20 Antonio Gates LAC vs. PHI 21 Marcedes Lewis JAC at NYJ 22 Ryan Griffin HOU vs. TEN 23 Julius Thomas MIA vs. NO 24 Vernon Davis WAS at KC 25 David Njoku CLE vs. CIN
Defense/Special Teams Seattle returns home to a much needed matchup with the lowly Colts, they should produce accordingly, same goes for Jacksonville getting a matchup with New York fresh off their demolishing of Baltimore (although a jet lag concern does remain). Cincinnati has been lights out against the Browns in previous seasons and 2017 looks to be no different now that the offense has regained their stature. Looking at options past the top 12 this week, there aren’t too many enticing options. If you’re digging for a streaming D/ST, the Chargers will have the chance to take advantage of the Eagles’ vertical passing game that has been prone to mistakes early on, not to mention they just lost Darren Sproles for the season.

Diary of Anne Frank transformed into graphic adaptation,"Image caption Seventy years after its first publication, Anne Frank's original diary is being transformed
""We do have similar personalities. I'm a bookworm, I love books.""
India is 14 years old. She's wrapped up in a maroon Harry Potter hoodie.
Like so many readers around the world, Anne Frank has helped her to understand an otherwise unimaginable and distant chapter of history.
India is one of a group of pupils congregated outside a canal-side warehouse in Amsterdam, where Anne's father once sold the gelling agent pectin. They've come to learn more about the life of the young wartime diarist.
Image caption Pupils from Dundee's Harris Academy in Scotland visit the building where Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis
Anne Frank was 15 when she died. She was an aspiring author, and one of more than a million Jewish children killed in the Holocaust.
Today her diary - which she nicknamed Kitty - is one of the most-read books in the world. Her teenage prose has spawned Hollywood screenplays, Broadway shows and countless other (re)productions.
Now it has been adapted into comic-strip format, in a book produced by the creators of the Oscar-nominated animation Waltz with Bashir, and there is a film coming soon too.
Image caption Scenes from the original book are reimagined in the Graphic Diary of Anne Frank
Accompanied by excerpts from her diaries and letters, the ""graphic diary"" depicts the story of how Anne Frank and her family went into hiding after her sister Margot received a summons to report to a Nazi work camp.
They survived for almost two years, tiptoeing around in the dark, damp confines of the ""achterhuis"" (secret annex) before being discovered.
Nazis emptied Anne's schoolbag to carry cash and jewellery looted from Jewish homes - her distinctive red-checked diary was recovered from the floor of the hideout.

Ari Folman, author and director of the new graphic adaptation, says he wants to ensure Anne's legacy remains relevant.
""The Graphic Diary is the perfect solution for the next generation,"" he says.
""To reach the readers of the diary you also have to find their language - more people will get to know the story. Period.""
In fact, readership of the original is increasing every year.

Anne Frank has come to symbolise courage, optimism and determination.
But it is her teenage attitude and frustrations that resonate with young people.
""It's easy to understand. She's eloquent,"" explains Eilidh Lean from the Anne Frank Trust, as she follows the Scottish students towards the secret annex where the Frank family hid.
""Six million people [approximate number of Jews murdered during World War Two] is difficult to get their heads around. Anne puts a human face on it. You can tell she's 13. She's going through puberty. They can empathise with her.""
But reimaging Anne's famous prose in cartoon form was not an easy decision.
Illustrator David Polonsky was initially reluctant, for fear of becoming part of the ""Holocaust industry"" sometimes accused of commodifying the Diary of a Young Girl (also known as The Diary of Anne Frank).
But he hopes the images will inform and stimulate contemporary debates about people forced out of their homes by politicians waging war.
""It is one story about one person, and each immigrant has a different story, too,"" he says.

Eleven-year-old pupils Sammy Neeter and Zahara Belen Mackay are conscious of the historical significance of their environment, proudly leading me to see Anne's old wooden desk. Sammy says it's ""weird but cool"" that he used to sit in her classroom.
His mother read Anne Frank's diary to him when he was seven years old. What does this earnest young man make of the comic-book style of interpretation?
""When you look at the pictures you cannot really see what happened; when you read the diary you can see more with your imagination...""
But Zahara believes this approach could help to engage younger audiences.
""It's nice for little children, but once you go to the secondary school you should just read the original book because it's very nice and it actually has her words.""
What is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it happening again. from The Diary of Anne Frank
The pupils from Dundee's Harris Academy have stepped out of the claustrophobic confines of the secret annex and into the invigorating autumn sunshine; inspired after literally walking an hour in Anne Frank's footsteps.
""It's quite surreal,"" Joshua reflects, gazing downwards. ""I saw how she lived... being determined and, like, just getting through and keeping on going.
""Now we've been here we can see how this genocide happened and we need to go home and really band together to make sure it never happens again.""
The Graphic Diary of Anne Frank is published in the Netherlands and Germany. An English edition will reach audiences in the UK and US early 2018. An animated film is scheduled for release in 2019."
Peek inside America's 'Doomsday' plane which US President will board if nuclear war breaks out,"The Doomsday Plane: America’s airborne war room.
 
As the potential of nuclear war looms larger, the United States has begun to utilize some of its most expensive and important equipment to deal with such an eventuality, including the Doomsday Plane.
 
The Doomsday Plane is a specially designed aircraft which continually follows the president in the skies while they travel on Air Force One in case a nuclear war erupts while he is in flight. These planes, which are known as National Airborne Operation Centres allow the President and other important figures in the government and the military to issue directives directly from the sky.
 
<img src=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plane10.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960"">
 
The planes are fitted with a huge number of defensive mechanisms and are even equipped to resist an electromagnetic pulse. They are also fitted with traditional analog flight instruments which cannot be targeted and destroyed by a cyber-attack. They are also attached to a five-mile-long trailing wire antennae which allow the war cabinet to remain in contact with the American fleet of nuclear submarines even in the event of the destruction of ground-based communication systems.
 
Naturally, these incredible wartime planes are incredibly expensive. Each one costs around $250 million to create and an astonishing $160,000 an hour to operate.
 
<img src=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plane8.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960"">
 
While these planes have come to prominence because of the potential of nuclear war with North Korea, they have been in operation since the 1970s. During the final decades of the Cold War, the planes were commissioned and constantly stood on alert at Andrews Air Force Base ready to take the president of his war cabinet into the skies at just fifteen minutes notice.
 
Since those days, there has always been a Doomsday plane at the Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska which is always primed to launch and meet the president in the event of an emergency.
 
<img src=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/plane4.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960"">
 
While the United States may be prepared for a potential nuclear war, most international observers hope that these terrifying planes will never actually have to be used.

Newly Passed Law Will Jail Parents if Their Kids are Caught Bullying,"By Matt Agorist
North Tonawanda, NY — As Americans continue to become more and more dependent upon the State to manage their daily lives, a new law that was just approved in New York epitomizes this irresponsible and outright complacent practice.
On Oct 1, a new law went into effect that will jail parents if their child is found bullying other minors.
According to WBNG:
Members of the North Tonawanda Common Council hope the new law will put a stop to bullying by holding parents accountable for their children’s actions. Parents could be fined $250 and sentenced to 15 days in jail if twice in a 90-day period their child under 18 violates the city’s curfew or any other city law, including bullying. North Tonawanda officials say the law is geared toward minors who repeatedly bully other children in public places. This law comes after four teens were reportedly kicked out of North Tonawanda Middle School for alleged bullying.
On the surface, the idea of fining and jailing parents for their bully kids may seem like an effective strategy to curtail bullying. However, all it does is open Pandora’s box into horrid nature of the police state and it provides no real solution.
We’ve already seen what happens when police get involved in matters that should not involve them, like childhood quarrels on playgrounds.
Just last week, TFTP reported on a horrifying video that showed a police officer pick up a tiny black child and slam him down face-first onto the concrete for being involved in a scuffle with another student. The presence of police in that situation only made it more dangerous.
Now, with the enactment of this new law, the parents of both of those students in the video mentioned above could also face potentially brutal police action.
Yes, parents are ultimately responsible for the behavior of their younger children. However, politicizing and criminalizing normal, yet often cruel, childhood behavior is not the answer. Also, there is simply no data to support its effectiveness.
We can have all the laws we want holding parents responsible for their children’s actions, writes Anita Kulick from ecparenting.org, but do they really make a difference?
“Very little research has been done to determine the effectiveness of laws that hold parents criminally liable”, says Eve Brank, an associate professor of law and psychology at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. “It’s often just a way for politicians to look hard on juvenile delinquency,” she says.
Often times, fining the parents of a bully could make the situation worse. Bullies, as multiple studies have shown, often have abusive parents who would probably not be too happy if their child happened to get them fined or thrown in prison.
Also, this law assumes that the bully will be correctly identified in the situation. Studies on the subject tell us that the opposite will often happen. School staff often have no idea that a child is being bullied. The same goes for the parents.
It is also important to note that many times, what parents and officials refer to as bullying is not at all seen as bullying by the child.
The real issue, Danah Boyd, who actually studies social interactions online among young people, suggests, is not that “bullying,” is a problem. It’s a lack of empathy. And, of course, that goes way beyond kids. As she notes, “just ask any marital therapist who’s trying to help a couple work through their relationship.” From there, as Tech Dirt notes, she points out that these interactions really aren’t all that different from adult interactions:
FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) When I look at how teens hurt each other, I can’t help but also see how they’re developing training wheels for future relationships and reflecting normative behaviors that they see around them. I hear teens’ dramas reflected in their stories about how their parents fight — with each other, with their friends and family and colleagues, and with them. What teens are doing is more coarse, more direct, and more explicit. But they’re witnessing adult dramas all around them and what they tend to see isn’t pretty. Parents talking smack about work colleagues or bosses. Parents fighting with each other or ostracizing their family members over disagreements.
While Boyd admits that she doesn’t have the perfect solution to preventing future bullying, looking at the situation through a different lens that isn’t so black and white is a much better start.
All this law does is use the State’s only tools to attempt to solve a problem — revenue collection backed with the threat of violence — ironically, they’re employing one of the tools of bullies.
Instead of simply making something illegal and claiming that it fixes the problem, perhaps it’s time we apply common sense to these scenarios and make it part of everyday life. Instead of teaching children how to be victims and call the police if they think they are being bullied, perhaps — with the right training wheels — we can teach them how to avoid being bullied altogether. Or, we can focus on teaching children empathy, so a bully thinks how they may feel before resorting to their abusive tactics.
As Mike Masnick writes:
There’s a great quote, apparently by Ian Percy that “we judge others by their behavior, while we judge ourselves by our intentions.” It’s really accurate, and highlights the difficulty of having empathy in such situations. People never think that they are in the wrong — and since they can’t readily understand or know the thought process and intentions of others, it often leads to them thinking the worst. If there were better ways to get people to at least recognize that others might also have good intentions, it could at least limit the negative impact of some interactions. Such fights and misunderstandings will never go away. It’s probably wishful thinking to even imagine they can be decreased even slightly. But calling them “cyberbullying” and outlawing jerky behavior or doing silly costumed song-and-dances isn’t going to help matters at all.

World Cup 2018: Who needs what to qualify for Russia next year?,"Germany beat Azerbaijan 5-1 to seal a 100% winning record in qualifying for the 2018 finals
England are there - and so are holders Germany - but there were mixed fortunes for some of the other home nations in their quest to qualify for next summer's World Cup finals in Russia.
Wales can still win their group and Northern Ireland are guaranteed a play-off spot but Scotland fell short, finishing fourth in Group D after drawing their crunch final game in Slovenia.
Meanwhile, three-time runners up the Netherlands are all but out, Argentina are in trouble and Syria are in a play-off to keep their unlikely World Cup dream alive.
Here, we analyse the scenarios to establish who needs what as qualifying reaches its climax. Bear with us - it's complicated, but worth it.
Who has qualified?
The tournament will consist of 32 teams, with hosts Russia joined by 31 qualifiers from around the globe.
The holders no longer qualify automatically, but Germany have progressed as group winners with a 100% winning record in Group C.
There are 13 other sides guaranteed to be there: Brazil, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Costa Rica, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, England, Nigeria, Poland and Egypt.
In Europe, the side that top each of the nine groups reaches the finals, while the best eight of nine runners-up go into November's play-offs.
What about the home nations?
Northern Ireland
Scotland's draw in Slovenia means that Northern Ireland are guaranteed a play-off place as one of the eight best-performing group runners-up.
Michael O'Neill's side lost their final game as Chris Brunt's own goal in the second half gave Norway victory in Oslo but still finished second with 19 points, four ahead of third-placed Czech Republic.
Northern Ireland are looking to reach their first World Cup since 1986.
Wales
Monday: Republic of Ireland (h) 19:45
""Don't take me home, please don't take me home,"" sang the fans as Wales marched to the semi-finals of Euro 2016.
Now they want to cheer them in a second World Cup, with their only previous finals appearance coming in 1958.
On Friday, Wales won in Georgia, but the Republic of Ireland also picked up three points to set up a huge meeting on Monday between the sides.
The winners in Cardiff will finish at least second, with a draw enough for Wales.
Leaders Serbia lost on Friday night to a last-minute Austria goal, meaning either Wales or the Republic could earn automatic qualification if Serbia slip up. It's all up for grabs.
Serbia host Georgia on Monday and require a win to be certain of reaching their second finals.
England
Unbeaten England, with eight wins and two draws, qualified automatically, despite following up Thursday's lacklustre 1-0 victory over Slovenia with an equally disappointing one-goal success in Lithuania on Sunday.
Russia 2018 will be England's fifth successive appearance at a major tournament, since failing to qualify for Euro 2008.
Their best performance in that time was reaching the last eight at the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Scotland
There was heartbreak for Scotland in Slovenia.
It was all going to plan when Leigh Griffiths gave them the lead in the first half, but two goals from Roman Bezjak meant that not even Robert Snodgrass' late leveller could rescue their qualification bid.
With only four points from their first four matches, few were rushing to back Scotland to reach Russia and seal a first World Cup appearance since 1998.
And so it proved, despite them claiming 14 points from their last five games.
The play-off puzzle
There's no easy way of explaining this, but here goes...
Eight of the nine European runners-up go into a two-legged play off for four places at next year's finals. That means the runner-up with the fewest points misses out.
It is important to note that results against the bottom side in each group do not count in the final play-off standings.
Therefore Slovakia, who are seventh, cannot improve their points tally in the final round of games. They can be overtaken by the two sides below them - Wales and Croatia.
The ranking of second-placed teams in the qualifying groups is determined by the highest number of points. If teams are equal on points, positions are decided by goal difference, goals scored, goals scored away from home and fair play points.
Fifa says teams will be seeded for the draw on 17 October, with the top four sides according to its rankings at the time in one pot and the remaining four in another.
The teams currently in second place are Portugal (third in rankings), Wales (13), Italy (17), Croatia (18), Slovakia (19), Northern Ireland (20), Sweden (23), Denmark (26) and Greece (47).
While there are clearly plenty of permutations, Northern Ireland and/or Wales could be seeded.
In the below table, teams in bold are certain to be in the play-offs.
Play-off table as it stands Position/Team Played Goal difference Goals scored Pts 1 Portugal 7 +18 22 18 2 Denmark 8 +7 13 14 3 Italy 7 +3 11 14 4 Sweden 7 +10 17 13 5 Northern Ireland 8 +4 10 13 6 Greece 8 +4 9 13 7 Slovakia 8 +5 10 12 8 Wales 7 +2 7 11 9 Croatia 7 +2 6 11
Wales and the Republic of Ireland can secure second place in Group D but both could still potentially be out of luck, as they can all still finish ninth in this table.
Rest of Europe - Netherlands set to miss out
Europe's places: 14 including hosts Russia. Already qualified: Belgium, Russia, Germany, England, Spain, Poland.
They may be three-times World Cup runners-up but the Netherlands' hopes of reaching next year's tournament are as good as over.
The Dutch are in third place in Group A, behind France and Sweden, and they need to beat Sweden by an improbable seven goals on Tuesday in order to reach the play-offs.
Surprise Euro 2016 quarter-finalists Iceland, the smallest nation to qualify for a major tournament when they reached Euro 2016, are in pole position to win Group I after a fine win in Turkey on Friday night.
Portugal, while sure of at least making the play-offs, face a critical final match at home to Group B leaders Switzerland on Tuesday as they aim to make up a three-point deficit.
Road to Russia: The key dates
17 October: Europe play-off draw (Zurich)

Asia - The Syria story
Syria players celebrate after a 2-2 draw with Iran secured a play-off against Australia
Asian places: 4 (plus a play-off place). Already qualified: Iran, South Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia
Now this is some tale.
Syria remain in contention for the World Cup despite the odds being stacked against a nation that is in the midst of a six-year war.
The team have no funding because of sanctions and play their home games in Malaysia, a 9,000-mile round trip.
But they made it through to a play-off against Australia, with Omar Al Somah's late penalty earning them a 1-1 first-leg draw on Thursday.
The return leg takes place in Sydney on Tuesday, 10 October (kick-off 10:00 BST).
The winner will face a Concacaf (North and Central America and the Caribbean) side in another two-legged tie the following month for a place at the World Cup.
South America - Argentina in trouble
South America places: 4 (plus a play-off place). Already qualified: Brazil
Wednesday 00:30: Ecuador v Argentina, Brazil v Chile, Peru v Colombia, Uruguay v Bolivia, Paraguay v Venezuela
Argentina have lost one and drawn three of their past four qualifying matches
It seems almost inconceivable that Lionel Messi will not be at football's biggest tournament, but his Argentina side are in serious danger of missing out.
The two-time champions, who have not missed the World Cup since 1970, are out of the group qualifying spots after a 0-0 draw with Peru on Thursday.
Only the top four in South American qualifying are guaranteed a place in Russia - and Argentina are sixth with one game left.
Argentina must win their final qualifier in Ecuador to claim at least fifth spot, which sets up a two-leg play-off against New Zealand.
Beaten finalists at the 2014 World Cup, Argentina are level on both points (25) and goal difference (+1) with fifth-placed Peru, who are ahead on goals scored.
So tight is the group that four points separate Uruguay in second (28) and Paraguay (24) in seventh and a win for Argentina could see them qualify automatically.
However, they have drawn their past three qualifiers and their recent record in Ecuadorian capital Quito, which is 2,900m above sea level, is poor, losing two out of their past three and drawing the other. Ecuador have lost their previous five qualifying games.
Peru are hosting fourth-placed Colombia and should they draw, Argentina would be eliminated if they did not win.
Chile, who are third, go to already-qualified Brazil, while Uruguay, who are all-but assured of their place in Russia because of their vastly superior goal difference, need just a draw at home to already-eliminated Bolivia to guarantee qualification.
South American World Cup qualifying: Fixtures - Tables
Concacaf - Who will join Mexico?
North America, Central America and Caribbean places: 3 (plus a play-off place). Already qualified: Mexico, Costa Rica
Mexico will compete at their seventh straight World Cup next summer having already qualified from the Concacaf section, with 2014 World Cup quarter-finalists Costa Rica joining them following a 1-1 draw at home to Honduras on Saturday.
But a third automatic berth is still up for grabs, while the fourth-placed side can also qualify through the inter-continental play-offs.
On Friday night, USA beat surprise package Panama 4-0 to move into third and within touching distance of automatic qualification.
They travel to bottom of the table Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday knowing victory will seal their spot.
Panama now look destined for a play-off match against either Syria or Australia to land a World Cup place for the first time in their history.
Honduras, whose match in Costa Rica was put back a day because of Hurricane Nate, also remain in the mix. They could still seal an automatic berth though it would need them to beat group winners Mexico and for both USA and Panama to lose their final games.
North America, Central America and Caribbean World Cup qualifying: Fixtures - Tables
Africa - Nigeria secure their place
Egypt qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1990
African places: 5. Already qualified: Nigeria, Egpyt
Nigeria secured a sixth World Cup appearance with a 1-0 win over Zambia, while Liverpool's Mohamed Salah struck an injury-time winner as Egpyt defeated Congo to reach the tournament for the first time since 1990, but Africa Cup of Nations champions Cameroon are out of the running.
There are no play-offs in Africa, with the team that top each of the five qualifying groups going through. Tunisia, Morocco and Senegal are the other current group leaders.

Oceania - New Zealand await opponents
Oceania places: One play-off place. Already qualified: None

How many times have you heard a politician say “diversity is our strength,” or “We are a stronger nation because of diversity?” Are those statements true, or are they just a lot of political banter? There is no doubt that we are a nation of many different backgrounds and cultures, but why does America seem like a different place than it was 50 years ago? If you listen to the Liberals it is because we are a less white nation. How true is that, we have always been a nation of all colors and different backgrounds? Theodore Roosevelt’s ideas on Immigrants and being an AMERICAN in 1907. “In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person’s becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American … There can be no divided allegiance here.

"A ""problem"" For The Wild Card Game & Sanchez...","A “problem” For The Wild Card Game & Sanchez…
(Before It's News)
(Sept. 13, 2017 – Source: Abbie Parr/Getty Images North America)
The media is looking for someone to blame for Thursday night’s loss to the Rays and they seem to have found it. It was days ago, and as the Yankees look toward their make it or break it game against the Twins on Tuesday the rumors are still out there. Fair or not, Gary Sanchez looks to be the scapegoat and some don’t want him behind the plate on Tuesday.
Sanchez has been scrutinized a lot this season for his defense and now suddenly when the Yankees need to focus on putting the best lineup on the field Tuesday there is growing support around media that Austin Romine should be the starting catcher that night. I like Romine, but do I want him catching and taking a DH spot away from another big hitter?
Photo Credit: Kathleen Malone-Van Dyke
A wild pitch and a low ball that should have been caught but instead scooted underneath Sanchez’s glove are causing a lot of doubt in people’s minds. Both Newsday and the NY Daily News are rallying for Romine behind the plate and Sanchez as the DH.
Do I have confidence in Romine defensively? Sure, but I don’t have a lack of confidence in Sanchez either. No offense to Romine, he’s not the same hitter as some of the other guys on the team. Using him in this game means losing a more powerful bat which I am not confident in with a one game playoff spot.
Sanchez is a young kid. He’s had some mistakes and we’ve seen that but we have lived with his defensive blips all season long and still managed to get to the playoffs. I don’t think this is the time to be taking certain guys out of their element and putting them into a position they haven’t been playing consistently all season. Sanchez has a groove and maybe putting him at DH here isn’t the best way to tinker with the lineup here. Experimenting in a one chance game could be a costly mistake.
(Brad Penner/USA Today Sports)
I really want the best bats in the lineup. We have our best pitcher going and we need the best possible offense too so I don’t want to think about who has to sit out just so we can give our backup catcher a night to play. Who do you have sitting on the bench? Aaron Hicks? Todd Frazier? Matt Holliday? It doesn’t add up for me. We’ve had nothing but success so far against the Twins in the playoffs but now is not the time to sleep on them. This isn’t a guaranteed win and we need the best guys on the field.
Sanchez has been one of our best guys all season even with those mistakes. He’s earned his spot, and I know he is going to come out fighting that day. He’s hungry for this game just like the rest of our guys and all fans. I think the media is going a little overboard here. It’s do or die time and I am riding with my everyday catcher here so I hope Joe Girardi does too.

"U.S. Expels 15 Cuban Diplomats, in Latest Sign Détente May Be Ending","They make it more difficult for citizens of both countries to engage with each other, imperiling already narrow channels of trade and commerce that opened after the 2014 rapprochement, and all but shutting down the immigration pipeline that allows Cubans to reunite with their families on American soil.
A State Department official said the action did not signal a change in policy or an official determination that Cuba was responsible for the illnesses, which have confounded American investigators trying to locate their cause.
But the official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, said the Cuban government had not done enough to protect Americans on its soil, and would need to ensure that the illnesses would not continue before personnel in either embassy could return.
American diplomats and their spouses began reporting symptoms that included hearing loss, dizziness, balance and visual problems, headaches and cognitive issues last December. By late January, the State Department realized that the illnesses were related and might have resulted from some sort of attack, perhaps by a sonic device, toxin or virus.
The number of personnel thought to have been affected has gradually grown over the months, and on Tuesday the State Department added one more to the list, bringing it to 22.
In a statement, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said the United States was expelling the Cuban diplomats “due to Cuba’s failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention.” Mr. Tillerson added that “this order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations.”
In a briefing with reporters Tuesday morning, a State Department official said the Cuban ambassador in Washington was informed of the expulsions in a 9 a.m. phone call from Francisco Palmieri, the top State Department official for the Western Hemisphere. The expelled embassy personnel were given seven days to leave the United States. The American Embassy in Havana will have completed its own drawdown by Friday.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
“We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba,” Mr. Tillerson said, “and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks.”
The Cuban government accused the Trump administration of using the health crisis as an excuse to drive out Cuban diplomats without any proof that Havana was responsible. At a news conference in Havana, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Cuba’s foreign minister, said the move was “eminently political” as well as “unwarranted and unjustifiable.”

Mr. Rodríguez faulted the American government for not reporting the ailments its diplomats suffered earlier to authorities in Cuba. The Cuban government, he said, has been denied access to the affected American personnel and the doctors who treated them, which has stymied Cuba’s ability to help with the investigation.
“Cuba has never perpetrated, and will never perpetrate, any type of attacks against diplomats or their relatives — no exception,” Mr. Rodríguez said. Nor, he added, would it allow a third party to do so. He dismissed accounts of hearing loss and other symptoms as “science fiction.”
Daniel Erikson, who as a White House and State Department adviser on Latin America during the Obama administration was deeply involved in the 2014 rapprochement with Cuba, said the severe cutback in diplomats in Havana could blind the United States during Cuba’s crucial political transition next year, when President Raúl Castro is expected to retire and a new generation of leaders take over.
“It looks like what began as a legitimate effort to protect American diplomats from harm is moving to a broader breakdown in U.S.-Cuban relations,” Mr. Erikson said.
The expulsions were cheered by opponents of the normalization, including members of the Cuban exile community, historically hostile to a Castro government, and condemned by supporters of warmer relations between Cuba and the United States, who said the move threatened to create a new chapter of hostility and play into the hands of those who wish to drive the two countries apart.
It would be especially damaging, proponents of engagement argued, if — as many current and former officials suspect — the Cuban government is not behind the attacks.

“If this is not the government, but rather other forces seeking to undermine the U.S.-Cuba relationship, a permanent downgrade would accomplish that objective for them,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the former Obama administration deputy national security adviser who helped to negotiate the move toward normalization.
But Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a leading foe of closer relations between the two countries, said the expulsions were a fitting response to Cuba’s misbehavior. He and other Republicans had called on Mr. Tillerson in a letter last month to go a step further, declaring all Cuban diplomats in the United States “persona non grata,” a dramatic diplomatic stigma that results in banishment with no right to return.
“The idea that over 20 American Embassy personnel could be severely injured in Cuba & the Cuban govt. not know about it is ridiculous,” Mr. Rubio wrote Tuesday on Twitter.
Some of those who were affected reported hearing odd sounds in particular rooms of their homes, leading some experts to speculate that some kind of sonic weapon or faulty surveillance device may have been at fault. F.B.I. agents investigating in Cuba have not been able to find the causes of the ailments.
With little hard evidence in hand, former American officials who follow Cuba closely have entertained a handful of theories that involve a third country, such as Russia — which would have an interest in driving a wedge between Cuba and the United States as the election approaches — or North Korea, which has en embassy in Havana. Neither scenario seems plausible without some level of Cuban government complicity, these officials say, considering how rigorously Cuba’s intelligence service tracks diplomats on the island.
The administration expelled two low-level Cuban diplomats in May in response to the illnesses, but with more diplomats and their spouses becoming ill, calls grew on Capitol Hill for a more forceful response.
In the meantime, Mr. Trump in June announced he was “canceling the last administration’s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,” although the stricter travel and commercial regulations he ordered would fall well short of doing so, and have yet to materialize.
Career American diplomats leaving Havana expressed regret on Tuesday that their missions were coming to an end.
“I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,” Scott Hamilton, the top American official in Cuba, wrote on Facebook. “Hasta la próxima, Cuba.”"

Do you think Brandon Saad was happy to return to Chicago? The 24-year-old winger scored a hat trick in his first preseason game of the 2017 NHL season returning to the Blackhawks after being acquired via a trade. Just days later, he did it again but this time in a game that counts. Saad played a big role in the Chicago Blackhawks blowout win over the defending Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2017 season opener. The Pittsburgh native capped off the night by scoring a hat trick in his first regular season game back with the Blackhawks

Eminem, who has never shied away from a feud, has made Mr. Trump a target before. In August, during a performance at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, Eminem told the crowd that he “can’t stand” the president before leading them in an obscene anti-Trump chant. Days earlier, at a concert in Glasgow, the rapper wore a shirt reading “FACK TRUMP” and made similar comments about the president before performing his song “White America.” (“See the problem is/I speak to suburban kids/who otherwise would’ve never knew these words exist.”)
But in an earlier era, the two men appeared together amicably. Ahead of the 2004 presidential election, Mr. Trump made a cameo in the Eminem concert special “The Shady National Convention,” which aired on MTV. “I know a winner when I see one,” Mr. Trump said in an endorsement of Eminem’s alter-ego, Slim Shady. “Donald Trump is telling you right now Slim Shady is a winner. He’s got brains, he’s got guts and he’s got Donald Trump’s vote.”
The rapper’s dense, blistering lyrics have courted controversy in the past, with some accusing him of writing homophobic and misogynistic verses.
And this is not the first time that Eminem has tackled politics in his songs: He has also taken aim at Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and George W. Bush. Last October, he released the freestyle track “Campaign Speech,” in which he called Mr. Trump “a loose cannon who’s blunt with his hand on the button.”
Eminem is thought to be gearing up for the release this year of his eighth major-label album and first since “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” in 2013. (A longtime producer for the rapper said earlier this month that the new music was “done.”) In the last few years, he has popped up for occasional guest verses and soundtrack songs — he is featured on Pink’s “Revenge,” out Friday — but has largely remained in the shadows, away from celebrity and social media.
“Sometimes I think that if I get comfortable or set in my ways of doing something, maybe I should step back for a minute and figure out how to mix it up a little bit,” he told The New York Times in 2015.
Other hip-hop artists and rappers have also targeted the president in their lyrics and music videos. The California rapper YG released a single last August called “FDT,” in which he repeatedly curses Mr. Trump’s name. Kendrick Lamar lashed out at Mr. Trump in his tracks “The Heart Part 4” and “XXX.” Snoop Dogg’s music video “Lavender,” in which the rapper aimed a toy pistol at a clown resembling Mr. Trump, earned a rebuke and a call for “jail time!” from the president himself in March."
Nigeria's Oranto Petroleum signs Uganda oil exploration deal,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Oranto Petroleum has signed two production sharing agreements with Uganda to explore for oil and gas around Lake Albert, the company said on Tuesday.
Oranto was among several companies, including Australia’s Armour Energy, that last year bid in Uganda’s first competitive oil exploration licensing round.
“We are excited to enter this agreement ... Lake Albert is home to some prime petroleum acreage,” Prince Arthur Eze, chairman of Oranto Petroleum, said in a statement.
The deal covers the Ngassa Shallow Play and Ngassa Deep Play exploration blocks located near the southern part of Lake Albert, Uganda’s ministry of energy and mineral development said.
Uganda discovered oil in 2006 in the Albertine rift basin along its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Recoverable crude reserves are estimated between 1.4 and 1.7 billion barrels and first production is due in 2020."
Bucs Go Quietly Into the Night 6-1,"Bucs Go Quietly Into the Night 6-1
(Before It's News)
Stephen Strasburg had a calm first; Gerrit Cole was lucky to get out with a run after three singles and a double. He was saved by a liner-back-the-box DP and a Marte-Rodriguez-Diaz cutdown at home. Strasburg was strong; he struck out five-of-six in the second & third and didn’t give up a hit until the fifth when Gregory singled off 1B Ryan Zimmerman’s mitt. The wheels fell off in the sixth. The Nats strung together three singles in four at-bats off Cole Train to plate a run and bring in AJ Schugel. He was tagged for a homer, walk and knock before Johnny Barbato was waved in to pull the plug. Strasburg and Angel Sanchez traded zeroes in the seventh. Stephen walked a couple of Bucs in the eighth to run his pitch count up to 98, so Ollie Perez (yes, the one and same) strolled in to put out the fire. Dan Runzler took his turn and Zimmerman took him long. Then Jason Werth did the same. Wade LeBlanc was reintroduced to the mound (it’s his first appearance since September 13th) and punched out Matt Wieters for the third out. Matt Grace gave up a Starling single and Cutch double to lose the shutout but not the game.
Starling may be the only Buc sad to see the season end… (photo Dave Arrigo/Pirates)
Another very meh performance by Cole Train (his final 2017 line is 12-12, 4.26), backed not at all by the bats, though, of course, Mr. Strasburg does make hitters besides the Pirates look silly. Ah well, two games to go and then…well, that’s the question, right?
Notes:
Starling again had two hits, as many as the rest of the team together.
Some Bucs visited Walter Reed before the game to mingle with the patients, with the group consisting of several coaches and players Stew, S-Rod, Trevo and Steven Brault.
Derek Jeter fired several more Marlin honchos, including pitch doctor Jim Benedict who was pirated from Pittsburgh in 2015; the Fish sent Trevo here as compensation. We wouldn’t worry too much about Benedict, though; he’ll land on his feet and quickly. The new bosses also canned Marc DelPiano, who left Pittsburgh about the same time to become the Miami overlord of player development. Mike Berger, a Central Catholic HS grad and Oakmont resident who was the assistant GM was also deep-sixed.

"As Thousands Left Homeless from Hurricanes, Trump Sends $75 Million MORE to Israel","By Rachel Blevins
As many Americans struggle to get back on their feet after their homes were destroyed by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the United States government has insisted that the only way to raise money for relief efforts is to increase the national debt—while setting aside another $75 million in aid for Israel.
Just one year ago, the Obama Administration signed the largest military aid deal in U.S. history, promising Israel $38 Billion over the next 10 years. However, while the deal stated that Israel was expected to return any money that was more than the original amount, the Trump Administration is breaking the rules.
According to a report from the Jerusalem Post, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was against giving an additional $75 million to Israel, a senior State Department official insisted that, “The administration is committed to ensuring that Israel receives the assistance that has been appropriated by Congress,” and that Trump will “work to ensure the $75 million in additional aid is delivered.”
While Congress had no problem giving Israel another $75 million in military aid, it did so by once again turning a blind eye to the long list of human rights abuses carried out by the Israeli military—and funded by the United States. Israel has occupied Palestine since 1967, and in those 50 years, it has been accused of numerous categories of human rights violations, according to a report from Human Rights Watch:
At least five categories of major violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law characterize the occupation: unlawful killings; forced displacement; abusive detention; the closure of the Gaza Strip and other unjustified restrictions on movement; and the development of settlements, along with the accompanying discriminatory policies that disadvantage Palestinians.
When Donald Trump ran a campaign based on “Making America Great Again” and truly putting “America First,” his supporters latched on to his promises, as if his presence in the White House would make everything different. While some of Trump’s supporters were adamant about his support for Israel, it should be noted that the Trump Administration is not just putting Israel first—it is also putting every country that is a recipient of U.S. foreign aid at a time when Americans desperately need help, first.

As Congress debated raising the Debt Ceiling, in order to find money for hurricane relief efforts, Sen. Rand Paul proposed an amendment that would allocate $7.85 billion in aid for repairing the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey, with an additional $2.5 billion set aside to prepare for Hurricane Irma—all by simply making cuts to foreign aid.
“My amendment, the ‘America First’ amendment, would take the money from money that we were going to send to foreign countries,” Paul said. “We send billions and billions of dollars to countries who hate us. We send billions and billions of dollars to countries who burn our flag. I think it’s a very simple choice that when we’re looking at those in need in our country, we quit sending money to other countries.”
In response to Paul’s proposal, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made a motion to table it, which passed 87-10. Unfortunately, while the majority of Congress does not seem to care about how much money the U.S. is wasting on foreign aid, it also does not seem to care about the status of the National Debt.
The United States’ National Debt surpassed $20 TRILLION this week, after jumping $317,645,000,000 in one day. The Trump administration’s $75 million gift to Israel is in addition to the record-breaking $3.8 billion a year the country already receives from the U.S.
The idea that the United States should continue to hand out obscene amounts of money it doesn’t have to the nations it favors—with no oversight—is a reminder that the vast majority of the elected officials who claim to represent the will of the American public, do not have their best interest in mind.

U.S. heating costs forecast to be higher this winter: EIA,"(Reuters) - Most U.S. households can expect higher heating expenditures this winter than in the previous two years, according to the government’s Winter Fuels Outlook released on Wednesday.
The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) said in a report that the higher expected heating expenditures between October and March are the result of more demand for heating because of colder weather and, to a lesser extent, higher fuel prices.
EIA said it based its heating demand projections on the most recent temperature forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
NOAA forecast that the coming winter would be 13 percent colder than last winter and closer to the average of the previous 10 years.
EIA projected the average household will pay about $644 to heat a home this winter with natural gas, $980 with electricity, $1,462 with heating oil and $1,661 with propane.
In all cases, those costs are up from the prior two winters.
Natural gas is the most common heating fuel in every region except the South, where electric heating is used more. The Northeast uses more heating oil than other regions, while propane is more prevalent in the Midwest.
EIA expects that heating oil margins will average 41 cents a gallon, up 14 cents from last winter.
The better margins are a result of lower distillate fuel inventory levels, strong demand for U.S. distillate exports, and the expectation of close-to-normal temperatures, EIA said.
Distillate fuel inventories, which include heating oil, totaled 35.5 million barrels on Sept. 29 in the Northeast, 16.8 million barrels lower than at the same time last year, and 1.9 million barrels lower than the previous five-year average for this time of year, EIA noted.
Distillate inventories unexpectedly fell over the summer and dropped even further heading into this winter because of refinery outages along the U.S. Gulf Coast after Hurricane Harvey.
“Unless severely cold temperatures in the Northeast coincide with severely cold temperatures in Europe, ample distillate supplies should be available to meet demand, but localized supply issues are possible,” EIA said."
Goodell and N.F.L. Owners Break From Players on Anthem Kneeling Fight,"The league might find resistance from players for any new directive on the anthem, setting the course for more public tension.
Martellus Bennett, a tight end for the Green Bay Packers, was quick to question the commissioner’s motives:
Goodell’s letter was sent two days after the Dallas Cowboys’ owner Jerry Jones — a leader among owners, a supporter of the president and never one to bite his tongue — said in no uncertain terms that he would bench any players who “disrespect the flag.”
“If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won’t play. Period,” Jones told The Dallas Morning News.
On Twitter, the president congratulated Jones for his stance.
Jones may be the most strident owner on this issue, but he is far from alone.
The Miami Dolphins owner Stephen M. Ross, who had backed the players’ right to protest and even set up a nonprofit group last year to foster race relations, appears to be changing his stance. He told The Miami Herald that while many players insist their protests are about raising awareness of racial injustice, the president has “changed that whole paradigm of what protest is” by turning it into a statement on the flag and support of the military.
Put another way, Ross is telling his players that they are hurting their cause by not standing for the anthem.
This about-face should not be shocking.
First and foremost, the owners, particularly those who have paid hundreds of millions of dollars for their teams, want to make money. From their point of view, anything that draws attention from the game, whether it is bullying in the locker room, domestic violence, or sitting or kneeling during the anthem, could put the television networks that broadcast the games and the league’s corporate sponsors in an awkward spot.

“At this moment, Jerry Jones has made a business decision,” said Frank Zaccanelli, a former part owner of the Dallas Mavericks who knows Jones well. “He’s in Dallas, Texas, and owns America’s Team. If any business took a 10 to 12 percent business hit, red lights would be going off. If you’ve got 50 percent of your people against you, you are going to have drastic changes. If this continues down this road, you’ll see a deterioration that will be significant.”
The owners, however, also want to avoid a showdown with the players’ union, and even some of their best players. After Jones threw down the gauntlet on Sunday, the N.F.L. Players Association issued a statement defending its members’ right to free expression.

“We should not stifle these discussions and cannot allow our rights to become subservient to the very opinions our Constitution protects,” the union said.
On Tuesday, Jones doubled down on his views during his radio show on KRLD-FM (105.3 The Fan). By threatening to bench players, Jones said his goal was to remove the Cowboys from the debate over whether players should or should not stand for the anthem.
“I don’t want there to be any misunderstanding as to where I want the personnel of the Cowboys to be when we’re at the No. 1 workplace we have, which is the field and the sideline on game day,” Jones said. “I want to do everybody a service, as I should in leading the team, and let’s be really clear about what our expectations are.”

The president’s tweets aside, the issue is in some ways taking care of itself. Hundreds of other players who protested two weeks ago, apparently more piqued at a president telling them what to do than the underlying causes the kneeling is supposed to highlight, are now back in line and standing for the anthem. Three players on the Dolphins who had knelt for the anthem in prior weeks chose on Sunday to stay in the locker room, which was also in defiance of league policy. They were not fined.
That may not be enough for some owners, though, particularly when nearly two dozen players on the San Francisco 49ers continue to kneel during the anthem. It was the former quarterback of that team, Colin Kaepernick, who ignited the round of anthem demonstrations by kneeling during the anthem last season to draw attention, he said, to racial oppression and fatal shootings by the police of African-Americans.
The 49ers’ chief executive officer, Jed York, has not only stood by his players, but also made a $1 million donation to the team’s community fund to highlight his support for Kaepernick.
The controversy has spilled into the broader football community, with some former players lashing out at current players who refuse to stand for the anthem. Mike Ditka, a Hall of Fame player and head coach, said Monday that he did not believe that there had been any oppression in the United States in the last century. “All of a sudden, it’s become a big deal now, about oppression,” he said.

Other former players, including wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., quickly reminded Ditka of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. “Great coach, clueless person,” Smith wrote on Twitter.
The Cowboys and other N.F.L. teams, as private businesses, can limit what employees can say or do while working. To date, the league has not enforced its rule that players must be on the sideline for the anthem and should stand while it is being played, though the wording in the league manual does not make standing a requirement.
The collective bargaining agreement, though, requires that these and other rules cannot be changed after the start of training camp.
Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman, said no fines had been issued for players not on the sidelines but he declined to say if penalties, which could inflame tensions between players and owners and attract the kind of attention the league would rather not have, would be levied going forward.
If the league suddenly began fining, benching or suspending players who do not stand for the anthem, it may prompt the union to file a lawsuit, said Michael LeRoy, who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
“There’s a basic fairness issue when you change a rule during the season, especially when you are getting browbeaten by the president,” LeRoy said. “On paper, it’s not a change in the rule, but in reality it is.”
Still, Lockhart, hinting at potential action by the owners, added,“Everyone here is frustrated by the process, and particularly the politics around this.”
The owners, he said, would be meeting next week in New York and — no surprise — will be discussing what steps to take next, including, potentially, strengthening the language in its game operations manual.
“There’s a strong feeling at every level,” Lockhart said, “that we ought to be getting back to football.”"
New timeline in Vegas shooting raises questions on police response,"The site of the Route 91 music festival mass shooting is seen outside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 2, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson
(Reuters) - Las Vegas police faced new questions on Tuesday over their response to last week’s deadly mass shooting, after releasing a revised chronology in which the gunman shot a security officer before, not after, opening fire from his high-rise hotel window.
The updated timeline for the bloodiest case of gun violence in recent U.S. history raised new uncertainty over why Stephen Paddock ceased firing on concertgoers once he began, and whether hotel security and police coordinated as well as first believed.
Aden Ocampo-Gomez, spokesman of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, declined to comment on the revised chronology, saying the agency would discuss the implications later.
Paddock, 64, killed 58 people and injured hundreds in a hail of bullets from his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, overlooking a music festival, and then shot himself to death before police could storm his room.
Nine days later, his motive remains a mystery.
Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, who oversees the police department, on Monday said Paddock shot a hotel security guard six minutes before beginning to fire on the crowd. By coincidence, the security officer, Jesus Campos, had been sent to check an open-door alarm on the same floor.
Officials initially said Paddock began raining gunfire onto the concert first, then stopped shooting after strafing the 32nd-floor hallway through the doorway of his room, when Campos was apparently detected via security cameras the gunman had set up outside his suite.
Earlier police accounts said a wounded Campos helped direct police to the room occupied by Paddock, who had quit firing on concertgoers by then. Lombardo originally said police officers reached the 32nd floor within 12 minutes of the first reports of the attack.
That sequence of events was changed in Monday’s new timeline issued by Lombardo.
“What we have learned is (the security guard) was encountered by the suspect prior to his shooting to the outside world,” Lombardo said.
Lombardo did not address whether the mass shooting could have been prevented, or halted sooner, based on the new chronology, but said it remained unclear why Paddock stopped firing on the concert when he did.
In an active shooter situation, response time can be as fast as three minutes, said Sid Heal, a retired Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department commander and tactical expert.

He questioned why it took police as long as it did to reach the room, if hotel security had called them immediately.
“Someone needs to account for those minutes,” he added.
Nevada Lieutenant Governor Mark Hutchison acknowledged to CNN on Tuesday that Paddock did not stop firing because of the guard, Jesus Campos, as had been assumed initially.
Campos immediately alerted the hotel’s in-house security team after he was shot at 9:59 p.m., six minutes before Paddock first opened fire on the concert, according to Lombardo.

But police were not aware Campos had been shot until they met him in the hallway, Lombardo said on Monday. The sheriff has estimated the time of their rendezvous at 10:18 p.m., three minutes after Paddock had stopped firing.
Rather than storm Paddock’s suite immediately, police paused to assemble their SWAT team and burst into his room to find him dead 81 minutes after the shooting began, according to the original account.
Protocol for Las Vegas hotels and casinos is to barricade the corridor where a shooting takes place and wait for police to arrive, said David Shepherd, a security expert who advises Las Vegas police and who ran the security team at the Venetian hotel on the Vegas Strip for eight years.
Police are trained to wait and negotiate with a shooter, rather than storm the room immediately, he said. Initial reports of multiple shooters at several hotels that night would also have confused police, he added.
“One of the biggest priorities is not to lose the life of a police officer,” Shepherd said by telephone. “So in those six minutes, it is highly unlikely police would have stormed that room.”
Police and security officers acted as quickly as possible in the circumstances, said David Hickey, the president of the union that represents Campos, based on what he had heard.
Officials with MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay, questioned the latest chronology from police.
“We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publicly, and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate,” the company said in a statement late on Tuesday."
"The bold, tech-fuelled plan to save Africa’s big beasts","Josephine Ekiru is not nostalgic for the past. Growing up in northern Kenya in an impoverished home, she was surrounded by violence and loss. People regularly killed the wildlife she loved, and they killed each other. Tribal clashes stoked by resource scarcity and decades-long vendettas were the norm.
Untold World Untold World is a special series from BBC Future that covers technology’s global impact, far beyond Silicon Valley. Discover more stories about how technology is profoundly changing underreported communities the world over.
“The only thing I was seeing was death,” Ekiru recalls. “I grew up thinking, ‘One day, I’ll tell my people that conflict is not good, that it only takes us in a circle of poverty.’”
Luckily in 2011, when Ekiru was 24 years old, she discovered the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), an organisation composed of community conservancies in Kenya. Those animal conservancies reject violence in favour of peace, sustainability and responsible, shared management of land and wildlife.
And in the Kenyan conservancies, there’s good reason for protecting wildlife: it goes hand-in-hand with a drop in overall crime and tribal violence.
Conservancy rangers increased security by cutting down on theft, road banditry and cattle raiding, and when conflict did flare, NRT elders would intervene to de-escalate the situation before fighting could break out.
Established in 2004, the NRT currently supports 35 community conservancies spanning some 17,300-square miles in northern and coastal Kenya – making up an area larger than Denmark. Over 600,000 people there live alongside elephants, rhinos, lions, zebra, giraffe, buffalo and more.
Elephants and rhinos are the very things that the community conservancies depend on for tourist income
Conservation is not something the local people do purely out of altruism, however. In a region that previously received close to zero tourists, NRT member conservancies now benefit from some 15,000 visitors per year.
Yet over the last decade, elephants and rhinos – the very things that the community conservancies depend on for tourist income – have come under siege in Kenya and beyond, thanks to surging prices for ivory and rhino horn in Asia.
While NRT conservancies have made significant headway with poachers, it’s not enough. So they’re adding a new strategy: using cutting-edge technologies to stop poaching and keep both people and animals safe – ultimately boosting everyone’s quality of life.
In nearby Samburu Conservancy, an NRT member, Ekiru could clearly see the tangible value of protecting a region’s wildlife and how it filters down do the human community. Samburu had tourist lodges and shared vehicles, and the land itself – verdant and teeming with life – was visibly healthier than the sparse, overgrazed savannahs where she lived. “This is another world,” she remembers thinking.
Ekiru contacted the NRT and then successfully campaigned at home for her community, Nakupurat-Gotu, to form a conservancy and join. Life has significantly changed for the better since then. “Without the NRT, Northern Kenya could be a war zone,” she says. “There would only be tears.”
With that, you’ve got a tourist product that drives economy and jobs, and brings government support because tourists need security - Ian Craig
The pay offs have been significant and are only growing. In 2016, NRT member conservancies brought in commercial income of over $600,000 (£461,000), mostly from tourism. “Wildlife is the catalyst that launched this, but there is also extraordinarily diverse habitat and deep, great culture,” says Ian Craig, who originally conceived of the NRT and now serves as its director of conservation. “With that, you’ve got a tourist product that drives economy and jobs, and brings government support because tourists need security.”
Around 10,000 people directly benefit from schools, renewable energy projects, water infrastructure and micro-finance initiatives, and more still enjoy other perks, including enhanced security, community phones in areas lacking cell service, new roads and a livestock purchasing programme that spares herders the long trip from field to market. Over 1,000 people are also employed by the NRT or work in related tourism jobs, including nearly 800 rangers, some of whom were former poachers.
Ekiru, who used to receive frequent death threats from poachers who did not appreciate her meddling, converted many of them from killers to conservationists herself. Those men were once expendable tools of criminal traffickers, but now, Ekiru says, “You hear people saying, ‘These are our elephants.’” The community acts as the eyes and ears on the ground, preventing their own from being corrupted by the allure of fast but tainted money made through poaching, and informing rangers if suspicious strangers arrive in town.
“A poacher has to walk through a community to reach a rhino, but the community says, ‘No, no, we’re getting benefits from these rhinos – they’re for us,’” says Rob McNeil, chief of operations at the NRT. “They’re the outer onion-layer of support.""
The strategy seems to be working. Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where the NRT is headquartered, has not lost a rhino since 2013, even as Kenya as a whole lost 46 rhinos from 2014 to 2015. The population is doing so well, in fact, that in 2015, Lewa transferred 11 of its rare black rhino to Sera Conservancy, located a few hours north – making Sera the first contemporary community in East Africa to be directly responsible for protecting and caring for that critically endangered species.
This year, the Sera rhinos will bring in some $50,000 (£38,400) in revenue from tourists who drop by the conservancy for a rare chance to partake in rhino walking safaris. The profits are expected to increase by an order of magnitude in a few years. While the majority of the NRT conservancies’ funding currently comes from donors, the hope is that tourism will soon account for an increasing amount of core funding. “The latent potential for tourism in the NRT is massive – absolutely massive,” Craig says. “The area hasn’t even been touched.”
Conservation managers have partnered with Vulcan, a Seattle-based philanthropic company created by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen
While poaching has been significantly reduced compared to the past, the NRT security is not entirely bullet-proof. From 2015 to 2016, populations of endangered African wild dogs and endangered Grevy’s zebras decreased on over half of the conservancies’ land, and other species, including buffalo and plains zebra, were also found to be in decline in some places. Worst of all, elephants are still being poached: from 2014 to 2016, 51 of the 7,000 elephants that roam the conservancies were killed for their ivory. The poaching numbers are falling annually – in 2012 alone, 103 elephants were killed – but the situation still leaves room for improvement.
Keeping poaching at bay is not only important from a conservation perspective, but also a livelihoods one: it helps keep safe jobs and other benefits that the conservancies bring.
While the rangers in the field and communities on the ground are the most integral components for protecting wildlife, cutting edge technology can massively boost their abilities.
To take protection to the next level, conservation managers have partnered with Vulcan, a Seattle-based philanthropic company created by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, to create the ultimate programme for managing wild areas.
The Domain Awareness System (DAS), as it is called, is their software solution. It compiles into one neat map all the data about a given area – locations of elephants, rangers and vehicles, sites of past poaching incursions, gunshot detections, weather and more. The end result enables informed decision-making taken to an elite military level previously unimaginable to conservationists.
“Unless we have one integrated visualisation and alerting platform, then we’ll have drones, sensors, cameras and all sorts of fancy things out collecting data, but it’ll all be a big mess,” says Ted Schmitt, Vulcan’s lead program manager for DAS. “Essentially, we’ve created a command and control solution for conservation.”
One stop software
DAS was, in some ways, dreamed up in the skies above Africa. As part of a massive scientific study, conservationists that Vulcan teamed up with flew their Cessnas around 18 countries, counting every live and dead elephant they saw. The data they collected made up the Great Elephant Census, the largest continent-wide survey ever undertaken. The results were telling: between 2007 and 2014, savannah elephants across Africa declined by 30%.
The disturbing findings prompted Allen to ask his team to find ways to help to reverse those trends. So Schmitt and his colleagues began posing the same question to all of the park managers with whom they were working: What did they most need to enable better protection of wildlife? “The thing we kept hearing was that even though they did not have enough data, they already felt overwhelmed by it,” he says. “There were all these little silos of data, but nothing to bring it into one picture to make use of it.”
So in 2015, Vulcan invited representatives from five conservation groups, including the NRT, to join them for a brainstorming session in Seattle. Based on their field partners’ input, Vulcan’s four DAS engineers got to work designing a system that worked not only in terms of data collection and presentation, but also in its ability to securely and reliably operate with the limited infrastructure and slow internet connections of most African protected areas.
DAS alpha testing began later that year at the NRT and Lewa’s joint security headquarters, and since then, the 1.0 product has been rolled out at eight additional sites, most recently in September. “We now have absolute minute-by-minute oversight of what’s happening,” Craig says.
On a recent afternoon in the Lewa-NRT Joint Operations Command Center, communications officer John Tanui, wearing a green uniform adorned with a silver rhino pin, paced between three large wall-mounted monitors, explaining the system to several foreign visitors – two of whom had travelled from South Africa to learn whether DAS might be an asset for protecting their own heavily poached rhinos. “DAS is coming up to be a big, powerful tool,” Tanui said. “It’ll save us a lot of time and energy.”
He pointed at the middle screen, a Smart Board that displayed a Google Earth landscape of orange and green overlaid with various icons – radios, rhinos, a plane and more. Those first symbols represented rangers in the field, whose radios include inbuilt GPS. Other multi-coloured icons scattered about the landscape revealed the location of 35 elephants, mostly matriarchs, tracked via GPS-enabled collars. Tanui pointed at one of them: “That’s Gambela. I can 100% assure you that she’s not alone.”
The collars that provide such precise tracking come courtesy of Save the Elephants, a Kenya-based non-profit. Based on scientific knowledge of animal behaviour and movement, experts there worked with the Vulcan engineers to develop elephant tracking software, which has been integrated into DAS and sends text alerts to rangers in the event of a possible problem. For example, if a collared elephant begins to streak – a sudden, panicked sprint of up to 60 miles in a single night – this may indicate that the herd has been attacked by poachers.
Tanui tapped the monitor once more and brought up a list of geo-located reports. Three hours ago, for example, an NRT home reported a theft, while the day before, a ranger had radioed in the location of a rhino named Juniper and her calf. For easy sorting, such reports can be categorised with over 20 possible tags, from an animal track sighting to a carcass to rain.
They can zoom in on the map to warn rangers that they are coming up on a large bush where poachers may be hiding
Serious incidents involving weapons or crime, on the other hand, range in severity from amber to red and trigger automatic alerts to management, who immediately reach out to the appropriate police and government personnel for joint decision-making. “The police know there’s an eye looking at the bigger landscape – something the government doesn’t have the capacity to do – and they can easily coordinate their security systems with the support of this technology,” says Titus Letaapo, chief programs officer of the NRT. “It’s made their lives easier, too.”
All of these capabilities mean that, even standing in a room 130 miles away (210km) from the actual location of a poacher incursion, Tanui and others can follow the scene as it unfolds in real time, and issue appropriate instructions to their men. They can zoom in on the map to warn rangers that they are coming up on a large bush where poachers may be hiding, for example, or to tell them check a home located half a mile ahead.
After an incident concludes, it gets entered into the digital database and can be later recalled and rehashed. Over 10,000 events – from poaching incursions to human-wildlife conflicts – have already been put into the system at the handful of sites where DAS is operating, along with accompanying information such as weather, time of day and more. Once those data build up to even greater levels, applying machine learning techniques to them – an approach of “deep interest” to Allen, Schmitt says – may be used to predict when and where poaching is most likely to occur. “Everyone knows that poaching goes up during a full moon, but what other patterns are lurking in the data that aren’t known but can be found?” Schmitt says.
Schmitt has already received interest from 30 other protected area managers, including ones in South America and Asia. But even if DAS finds widespread application, it will not solve every challenge that the NRT conservancies and other parks and reserves face. It cannot fix protected areas that are plagued by corruption, mismanagement or apathy, and nor can it address larger strains caused by global warming and overpopulation. As Ekiru says, “We see the world changing: the population of people is adding up, but the land is not adding up along with it.”
But DAS will, at least, make the job of protecting wild places and the people and animals who live there easier – which will further reinforce communities’ commitments to conservation.
“I want to see a society with good smiles, with peace and with more women empowered,” Ekiru says. “I know it’s a process, but things are changing. I can see my grandchildren growing up and getting a good life.”

War on Cash Backfires on India’s Economy,"By Clint Siegner
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a surprise attack on cash in late 2016. He gave Indians a few days to convert the two largest denomination bills then circulating to bank deposits, after which point any undeposited notes would become worthless. The move was intensely controversial. Transactions completed using cash represented the vast majority of economic activity in the country.
In order to sell the program Modi employed a familiar strategy. He vilified the users of cash as tax cheats and criminals. He promised the measure would punish black marketeers, boost the Indian economy, and increase tax revenues. The latter may be true – forcing transactions onto the grid is good for nosy bureaucrats trying to impose taxes and controls.
But it now appears Modi’s claims about the amount of criminal activity tied to cash and promises of economic growth were nonsense.
The official argument was that cash is an indispensable tool for black marketeers. The reform would catch many of these “criminals” with piles of cash they would be unwilling to declare and deposit. That argument fell apart last week when the Indian central bank reported that 99% of the outlawed bills were converted to deposits. Turns out very few “criminals” were punished.
Meanwhile the Indian economy is paying the price. Growth has slowed significantly and some estimate as many as 5 million jobs have been destroyed by the demonetization of cash. More and more Indians are angry.
They didn’t enjoy the upside promised by Modi. Instead, they suffered massive economic disruption and loss of privacy. Perhaps India’s experience will provide an object lesson elsewhere in the world where bankers and the political elite are waging a similar war on cash.

"10/7: Chuck Axed; HBD Brickyard, Adam, Moonlight Ace & Chuck; AS; Season Finales...",Red Flag Warning: These California Wildfires Are ‘Among The Most Destructive Fire Events In US History’ And They Are About To Get Even Worse
"Ah! My kid is having a tantrum, and I want to scream","(CNN) Most parents have experienced it: that moment when their son or daughter has a full-blown temper tantrum, which may involve screaming, crying, stomping their feet, dropping to the floor or all of the above.
Of course, this is stressful no matter where it happens, but when it's in a public place and you feel as if everyone is looking at you and thinking ""What kind of parent can't control his or her kid?"" you may want to curl up in a ball and start screaming yourself.
But you know that won't really be productive, so what can you do?
For some answers, we turned the camera on kids themselves: a group of New Jersey fifth- and sixth-graders, many of whom admitted having tantrums at one time or another.
Grace Szostak, who just started middle school, says she had them until the third grade and could be found banging on the doors in her room.
""It was not good,"" she conceded.
As part of a new video series, ""If I Were a Parent,"" showcasing kids taking on modern-day parenting problems, I asked Grace and her classmates what they would do if their son or daughter had a tantrum.
""I'd say 'cool down, cool down,' and I'd sit with them and talk to them about it,"" said Lance Jenkins, who is in the sixth grade.
And if they don't calm down? ""That's the hard part,"" he admitted.
Casey Wescott, who's also in the sixth grade, said parents are sometimes quick to just react and may not take the time to figure out why their children are crying. ""Try to slow down a little more and ... ask your kids what is wrong,"" he said.
Fiona Laddey, a fifth-grader, said it's important for parents to stay calm, ""because if you start yelling, it would be even more chaos.""
Family therapist Tricia Ferrara is author of ""Parenting 2.0.""
Tricia Ferrara , a licensed family therapist and parenting strategist who has been in private practice in the Philadelphia area for more than a decade, agrees.
Ferrara, author of ""Parenting 2.0: Think in the Future, Act in the Now,"" said that while it may be hard to do, we need to forget about the other people who may be watching us during those cringe-inducing moments when our children are in the throes of a tantrum.
""I always say to parents ... you've got to stop, drop and do what you have to do,"" Ferrara said during a previous interview. ""Escalating back to the child is not helping anything, because that's more sensory information that is going to make them go nuclear.""
Think of yourself as a ""tuning fork,"" she said. ""The calmer and clearer you can be, the better things will go.""
Adults should look for creative ways to maintain authority and realize that eliciting even small concessions from a child can go a long way, Ferrara said. ""Create one bit of upside, even if it's 'you take one breath and we count to three together, (and then) we can get you what you want, and then we'll go home,' "" she explained. ""What that does is, it keeps you in control and as the authority in the situation.""
The biggest mistake parents can make?
Totally giving in to the tantrum is never a good way to go, experts say, and children themselves seem to understand why that's not a good plan.
""That teaches them, 'Oh, my parents give in, so I can throw more tantrums and get everything I want,' "" said Toniann Garruto, a fifth-grader.
A child might think, ""Oh, I can throw a temper tantrum, and I can get a cookie if I stop, so I'm going to throw a temper tantrum five seconds later and then stop,"" said Sean Wescott, who's in middle school.
Casey, Sean's twin brother, added, ""If you give in, that's going to occur more and more, and you don't want that to happen.""
Too many parents (this mother included) don't realize that there are things you can do to prevent a meltdown, Ferrara said.
When kids are tired and hungry, they can't tell you what's going on, so it's probably best to avoid errands at the end of the day, when it's harder for kids to coordinate their emotions with their bodies, she said. (I joked in a previous story how I wished I had this information when my kids were little. Had I know then what I know now, I probably wouldn't have taken them grocery shopping right before dinner time!)
The ""biggest mistake"" parents make is going into situations ""without a strategy,"" Ferrara said. ""Do you go to the hairdresser without a plan? A business meeting? Go buy a car? No, but we always allow ourselves to fall into these potholes with our kids with no plan,"" she said.
If your child tends to have tantrums if they don't get what they want, you can tell them that how they behave is going to determine whether they are going to get to do something later, such as play with birthday presents or have a play date with friends.
Tell us your story Tell us your story
We love to hear from our audience. Follow @CNNHealth on Twitter and Facebook for the latest health news and let us know what we're missing.
And during an outing, if your child starts to behave in a way that is unacceptable, instead of getting into a verbal joust with them, you can say, "" 'Do you want to play with your birthday presents?' You can remain clear and calm and communicate in a way"" that they understand, Ferrara said.
There is always another option when your kid has a tantrum in a public place, joked Tyler Schlegel, a fifth-grader. If he were a parent, he said with a smile, ""I'd go home."""
Most Investors Won’t Be Buying Gold & Silver until AFTER Big Gains Occur,"By Clint Siegner
Physical demand for bullion rounds, coins, and bars remains somewhat soft in the U.S. This year’s run higher in prices as well as rising geopolitical tensions has whet the appetites of some investors, but it has not yet triggered broad participation.
With strong gains both this year and last, metals prices have been responding to a host of issues – from unrestrained federal borrowing to the prospect of nuclear exchange. But they haven’t moved up as much as many expect.
After advancing dramatically in the prior decade, gold and silver have not responded as strongly to the explosive money creation and debt of the last few years as stocks have. And while predictions of crisis have been plentiful, the “Big One” hasn’t yet materialized.
Some honest money investors have even been drawn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This is, in part, because of the tremendous run-up in prices in recent months (notwithstanding last week’s crash), and because cryptocurrencies might prove beyond the reach of Wall Street and central bankers to control.
Unfortunately, many investors will be sitting on the sidelines until precious metals are proven outperformers again, and in doing so, they will miss a big move up in prices. While we expect to see much higher gold and silver prices, the catalysts for that aren’t anything to root for. Serious geopolitical strife, a major correction in stock prices, or the U.S. dollar in free fall all mean hardship and pain.
Change is inevitable, and the U.S. economic expansion is getting long in the tooth. Even artificial markets must ultimately yield to actual physics.
The good news for investors with a contrarian bent is that buy premiums on bullion products are the lowest they have been in a decade – and inventory is plentiful. Down the road the opposite may be true, i.e. high premiums and shortages of the physical gold and silver in minted form.

Ravens Take Exception to The Boos,"Ravens Take Exception to The Boos
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
Despite the fact that the Ravens still have a chance to salvage a successful season given the watered-down product that is the NFL, fans here in The Land of Pleasant Living are anything but optimistic. Part of the gloom and doom stems from the wretched Ravens offense. Part of it has to do with the protests of many of the league’s players.
And unfortunately, apathy has crept into the fan base.
That’s the last thing Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti wants to see.
On Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium, the Ravens, as a team, took a knee, to gather in prayer. Those in attendance at The Bank showered the home team with a cascade of boos. Who could blame them? They weren’t aware of the plan, and emotions already ran high. The first sign of a bended knee signaled the cue for agitated fans.
Maybe the Ravens should’ve let the fans in on their little secret.
Why shroud the good intentions in mystery?
The plan obviously backfired.
Just as obvious is the disconnect between the players and fans.
Very upset about this…no one disrespected the anthem… AND STILL!! What’re y’all really mad about?? https://t.co/cFGhzgxmHU — Rico Suavee (@ronnie_stanley) October 1, 2017
Perhaps the next time around fans will be more accepting now that they understand the intent. The Ravens attempt at compromise had merit. A prayer for understanding and solutions while standing in unison to the playing of the National Anthem, represents a noble olive branch for both sides of this societal divide.
Maybe this Sunday will be more peaceful.
FLACCO’S PREGAME FUMBLE
During the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner prior to the Ravens v. Steelers, cameras were everywhere, and focused on key players. That’s hardly a surprise. CBS wanted to capture the mood, reactions and body language of the players during the anthem’s 90 seconds in response to all of the furor from previous weeks.
As they stood along the sidelines, the players were well aware of this. For 1 ½ minutes it was clearly a time to show respect. Well, clear to everyone not named Joe Flacco.
At around the 1:04 mark of the video below, Flacco can be seen chuckling in response to someone just behind him to his right. Given the stage, the focus and all of the controversy surrounding the anthem and the fan’s perceived lack of respect for all the flag stands for, Flacco STILL lacked the awareness of that moment’s importance.
No wonder he can’t break old habits and step up his game to the level of his pay.
Click here to view the embedded video.
Flacco is paid to be a top 5 quarterback yet hovers at the very bottom of the league’s signal callers – currently one notch above the 32nd ranked starting QB, DeShone Kizer. He still predetermines where he’s going with the ball; makes few pre-snap adjustments; stares down receivers; struggles to properly execute a screen after 9 ¼ seasons; possesses sloppy ball skills and has no clue how to use cadence as a weapon.
Anyone watch last night’s game in Kansas City? Alex Smith kept the Redskins front seven off balance all night with cadence. That leads to free plays and it helps the offensive line gain an edge. It helps them to gain leverage which leads to more wins at the line of scrimmage.
The Ravens know this. The coordinator, senior offensive assistant and offensive line coach all know this. But they still can’t get their 10-year vet to execute it? Really?
I guess after his grade school antics during an important pregame moment, we shouldn’t be surprised.
Flacco is hardly the brightest bulb in the bunch. He’s a bit like Bull Durham’s Nook LaLoosh.
I wonder how many takes it took to get those M&T Bank commercials right?

"Sunday Morning Start ‘Em or Sit ‘Em: Wayne Gallman, Davante Adams, Melvin Gordon & More","Sunday Morning Start ‘Em or Sit ‘Em: Wayne Gallman, Davante Adams, Melvin Gordon & More
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
Just hours before the start of Week 5 I know many people have questions running through their heads. Who should I start? Who should I sit? Let’s take a look at how some of the recent news changes things:
Wayne Gallman – New York Giants – Running Back
Paul Perkins was ruled out for this week and after missing Week 4 it’s possible that Orleans Darkwa is limited (assuming he returns). That clears an opportunity for Gallman, who looked more impressive than Perkins and Darkwa have at any time this season in Week 4:
11 carries for 42 yards (he also caught 2 passes, including 1 for a TD)
This could be Gallman’s opportunity to seize the job moving forward, and he has a favorable matchup to do so. The Chargers, who are traveling to the East Coast for an early game, are allowing the eighth most points per week to opposing running backs (due to a league leading 611 rushing yards). They were also torched by LeGarrette Blount a week ago, who took 16 carries for 136 yards. While Gallman isn’t quite a trustworthy option, he’s a viable FLEX (and potentially a RB2).
Verdict – Borderline RB2, solid FLEX
LeGarrette Blount – Philadelphia Eagles – Running Back
Speaking of Blount, he should get a lot of touches again this week with Wendell Smallwood likely out. He does not have an ideal matchup, with Arizona having allowed just 277 rushing yards to opposing RB on the season. They are traveling east for an early game, however, so there is a little bit of hope. He’s more of a risky FLEX play given the matchup, though it all comes down to your alternatives.
Verdict – Potential FLEX play

Rishard Matthews – Tennessee Titans – Wide Receiver
According to Adam Schefter (via Twitter):
“Titans QB Marcus Mariota, considered game-time decision due to hamstring, not expected to play vs. Dolphins, per source. Matt Cassel starts.”
Obviously Mariota needs to be benched, the question is what impact does his absence have on the skill players around him. You would think they will go with a run based attack, meaning both DeMarco Murray and Derrick Henry get a slight boost in value.
The impact is on Matthews, who was viewed as a borderline WR2 entering the week. As it is his numbers aren’t very impressive, turning 32 targets into just 17 receptions, 250 yards and 1 TD. With the downgrade in QB he’s barely on the WR3 spectrum and should be avoided due to the downside risk.
Verdict – Sit unless absolutely desperate
Melvin Gordon – San Diego Chargers – Running Back
It’s been a disappointing season for Gordon, though he had a big Week 3 against the Chiefs (17 carries for 79 yards and 1 TD) and this could be a nice rebound week. Gordon was quoted by ESPN’s Eric Williams after Week 4 (click here for the article) as saying:
“I’m super frustrated at the moment, but I can’t let it break me,” Gordon said after the game. “It all falls under the same thing. But obviously not getting the touches and not getting the win — the win is the biggest thing. But then the fact that you feel like you can’t even help, you’re just kind of sitting back, it sucks because I just feel like I’m kind of helpless back there.”
Look for the Chargers to try and feed him the ball this week, especially against a Giants’ defense that’s averaging 4.5 yards/carry to opposing running backs. While the Giants defense could be stout against the run, this is a must play situation.
Verdict – Must play in all formats
Davante Adams – Green Bay Packers – Wide Receiver
According to Rob Demvsky (via Twitter):
“Davante Adams is traveling to Dallas and has cleared the concussion protocol, per source. He’s expected to play”
It will be interesting to see if he’s limited in any way, but the Cowboys are a solid matchup in a game that should be a bit of a shootout. While the risk does knock Adams down a bit, consider him a potential WR2 and a must use WR3 (at worst).
Verdict – Potential WR2, depending on your alternatives
Amari Cooper – Oakland Raiders – Wide Receiver
Cooper has been practicing and was removed from the injury report, but does that make him a trustworthy option? Everything seems to be working against him:
Derek Carr is likely to miss the game The matchup is poor, with the Ravens allowing the fourth fewest points per week to opposing wide receivers Cooper has been miserable, turning 31 targets into 12 receptions and 110 yards (plus his lone TD came in Week 1)
If you are desperate for a WR3 then maybe, but in most cases the risk outweighs the potential reward.
Verdict – WR3, at best

Jamaal Williams/Aaron Jones – Green Bay Packers – Running Back
Ty Montgomery was listed as doubtful, opening things up for Green Bay’s pair of rookie running backs to step up. The question is who is the better option for fantasy owners? Dallas’ defense has been far more susceptible to opposing running backs who can catch the football:
Rushing – 357 yards, 1 TD
Receiving – 30 receptions, 272 yards, 2 TD
Neither of Green Bay’s rookies have displayed much in that regard quite yet, and they will likely share the touches nearly equally (unless someone gets hot early). In other words it’s a gamble regardless, and unless you are desperate it’s one to avoid.
Verdict – Desperation FLEX play, but far too unpredictable
Elijah McGuire – New York Jets – Running Back
Matt Forte has been ruled out, leaving McGuire and Bilal Powell to share the backfield. That’s going to lead many to jump on the McGuire bandwagon, though he’s going to continue to play second fiddle. He got 12 touches a week ago, and that’ll be right around where we’d expect him to be (8-12 touches is a good estimate). While the matchup may not scare you, with limited touches and the unlikelihood that he matches the explosiveness from Week 4 (131 yards and 1 TD) he’s going to be a tough player to trust.
Verdict – Borderline FLEX play, but not a must start
John Brown – Arizona Cardinals – Wide Receiver
Adam Schefter tweeted this morning that, “Cardinals WR John Brown, listed as questionable due to quad injury, is expected to play Sunday vs. Eagles, per source.” Considering a favorable matchup you would think that would put Brown on the map, but the risks still outweigh the rewards:
Will he be limited in terms of snaps? When he’s on the field how often will he be targeted, with Larry Fitzgerald, Jaron Brown and J.J. Nelson all in the mix There’s general risk for a West Coast team traveling east and playing an early game
Verdict – Sit ‘Em, as risks outweigh the potential rewards
Dak Prescott – Dallas Cowboys – Quarterback
On the fence about utilizing Prescott this week against Green Bay? You shouldn’t be, after he posted a pair of strong performances against them a year ago (549 yards, 6 TD, 2 INT). Just to make things even more attractive, look at this stat about the Packers’ defense courtesy of ESPN’s Matthew Berry:
…since the start of last season, opponents have completed 69 percent of passes and scored 28.9 points per game at home against them compared to 61.4 and 19.0 at Lambeau
This game could easily be a shootout, so consider Prescott a solid QB1 in all formats.
Verdict – Must start (unless you have one of the elite)

The N.F.L.’s Big Head-Scratcher: What’s Wrong With the Cowboys?,"And yet, the Cowboys’ defense has not forced a takeaway in three consecutive games, and it has yielded scores on 14 of 18 possessions – six touchdowns, eight field goals – excluding the Rams’ kneeldown at the end of that game. Dallas’s offense has scored on seven of its last eight first-half possessions across these past two losses but has sputtered after halftime, managing two touchdowns and a field goal. Even when Dallas did score in the second half Sunday, going ahead late by 31-28, it mismanaged the clock.
Given 73 seconds and a timeout to guide Green Bay into field-goal range, Rodgers thought it better just to keep on going, to throw for a touchdown and finish the darn thing, and because he is Aaron Rodgers, that is what he does.
“Can I say the F word?” said Dallas defensive lineman David Irving, when asked to convey the difficulty of defending Rodgers. Quickly adding, with a chuckle: “That guy is awesome at what he does. It takes everybody to stop one guy.”
That is both a platitude and a keen bit of insight. As precise a passer as Rodgers is when throwing from the pocket, all the Cowboys wanted Sunday was to contain him there. The danger he poses when he scrambles, when he improvises, can be measured by his absurd 35-yard sideline completion, on third and 20, that set up the winning field goal in last season’s divisional playoff round.
But that was then, and the Cowboys are loath to discuss last season. It’s behind them, and all that. If they were destroying teams instead of getting clobbered by Denver and blowing halftime leads to Green Bay and the Rams, and if their offensive line were creating those same wide creases for Elliott instead of being manhandled across the first three quarters Sunday, and if they were zipping toward 13-3 again instead of explaining three defeats in five games, they might be more likely to elaborate on those comparisons.
Since they are not, the Cowboys were left to address less appealing things, such as how their offensive highlight of the game – the go-ahead drive that took 17 plays and consumed 8:43 of the fourth quarter – came to unmoor them. It was the last two plays of that drive that seemed to haunt Jones afterward.
On second and 2 from the Green Bay 11 with 1 minute 24 seconds left, Prescott threw an incomplete fade to Dez Bryant. Had the Cowboys run, they would have forced Green Bay to take its final timeout or, at the least, drained another 35 or 40 seconds off the clock.

Prescott then faked a handoff and ran for a touchdown. He could have slid at the 1-yard line, wasting more time and giving Dallas first and goal and four chances to breach the goal line.

Passing up a touchdown in that situation would have run counter to Prescott’s instincts – “it’s important to get in the end zone and put the pressure on them,” he said – and Coach Jason Garrett said afterward that he agreed with Prescott’s decision.
Jones appeared less certain.
“What we all wanted to do was to keep the ball away from him, but obviously we need to score a touchdown,” he said, referring to Rodgers. “We’ll be second-guessing those last two calls – and I know you will, as well – for a long time.”
The clock showed 1:13. As expected, the Packers said afterward they were confident that they would score, and the Cowboys said they were confident that they would prevent Rodgers from scoring. But had the fans been polled, they almost certainly would have deemed the outcome as inevitable.
“It looked really easy,” said receiver Davante Adams, who caught two of Rodgers’s three touchdown passes. “Sometimes it’s not always as easy as it looks, but he makes it look that way.”
The best players display their brilliance in ways overt and subtle, and on third and 8 from the Cowboys’ 30 and with the pocket collapsing, Rodgers slipped free from Benson Mayowa and rolled left, where he felt Irving’s arms around his ankles.

In the past, that effort might have been enough to bring down Rodgers. But he has been ever more cognizant of his running style – how, sometimes, he does not pick his knees up, which leaves him susceptible to getting tackled from behind. High-stepping out of the tackle, Rodgers scampered for 18 yards, to the Dallas 12.
On the next play, Rodgers couldn’t connect on a fade to Adams, covered by Jourdan Lewis, but he and Adams shared a glance. “Let’s do it, again,” Adams told Rodgers. The quarterback amended the formation, and the ball was over Lewis’s head and into Adams’s hands before Lewis could even turn.
“He threw it exactly where it had to be,” Lewis said.
Lewis, a rookie, had three pass deflections in an otherwise excellent game. But in tone and in substance, his lament was familiar.

Once again, the Cowboys could not stop Rodgers. Once again, they staggered in the second half. Once again, they scored 30 points and gained more than 400 yards and still lost. According to the N.F.L., the rest of the league combined has two such losses.
Dallas has yet to play Atlanta, Kansas City, Oakland or Seattle. Or division rivals Philadelphia and Washington – twice. Next week, the Cowboys get a reprieve.
The bye allows teams to reflect and assess all that has gone wrong and right. The Cowboys are bound to examine a running attack whose early struggles have put more of an onus on Prescott, and a defense that buckles at the game’s pivot points.
How the Cowboys perform when they return, on Oct. 22 against the winless 49ers, will help reshape their season. At least they will not score four touchdowns at home and lose. The game is in San Francisco."

"From Tipper to Trump, Eminem is no stranger to political criticism","(CNN) Eminem's freestyle rap aggressively taking on President Donald Trump and his supporters at the BET Hip Hop Awards on Tuesday was his most vocal criticism yet of this president.
But not of any president.
Over the course of his Grammy-winning career, the combative rapper has used his music to start feuds with celebrities, artists, the media and plenty of politicians.
Eminem was a fierce critic of President George W. Bush, particularly in the blistering anti-Iraq War song ""Mosh,"" and was once investigated by the Secret Service for rapping that he wished the President would die. His violent, aggressive, misogynistic and anti-gay lyrics even sparked hearings in Congress.
Never afraid to speak his mind or cause controversy, Eminem has variously slammed Bill and Hillary Clinton, Lynne Cheney, Tipper Gore and scores of other politicians he saw as hypocritical leaders.
Here's a look back at Eminem's most memorable dips into politics and political criticism.
Anti-Iraq War and Bush lyrics
Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, intensely criticized Bush's Iraq War policies in his protest song ""Mosh"" in October 2004. The song called on people to ""rebel"" and ""raise hell"" in protest and called out Bush personally.
""Stomp, push, shove, mush. F*** Bush. Until they bring our troops home, come on,"" he raps.
The third verse featured further criticisms and suggested Bush fight the war himself.
""Let the President answer a higher anarchy. Strap him with an AK-47, let him go fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way. No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil,"" he says.
He further tells his listeners to ""look in his eyes, it's all lies. The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped, and replaced with his own face.""
In case the lyrics weren't clear, an accompanying video further expressed his political message. The video featured images of Bush as well as protesters in black sweatshirts storming the US Capitol.
At one point, an animated Eminem looks at a wall of newspaper articles with headlines such as ""Bush Knew."" Another headline reads ""President Bush Signs Patriot Act,"" but with the word Patriot crossed out and replaced with the word ""DEATH.""
In an interview with Rolling Stone in 2004, he said Bush ""started a mess"" and had ""f***ed up so bad"" in going to war.
""[Bush] has been painted to be this hero, and he's got our troops over there dying for no reason,"" he said.
""We got young people over there dyin', kids in their teens, early twenties that should have futures ahead of them. And for what? It seems like a Vietnam 2. Bin Laden attacked us, and we attacked Saddam. Explain why that is. Give us some answers.""
Secret Service investigation
Eminem was once actually investigated by the Secret Service. A lyric in his song ""We Are American"" talks about the president, which was Bush at the time.
""F*** money. I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the President dead,"" he says.
That line led to the Secret Service investigation, which is routine when something that appears to threaten the president is brought to agents' attention.
""It would be saying too much to make too big a deal out of this,"" one Secret Service official told CNN at the time
Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore
Eminem has often played up his fights with those in power as a point of pride.
That led to a rebuttal in the song ""White America"" from 2002, in which Eminem proudly says he's ""in trouble with the government"" for his lyrics.
""I must have struck a chord with somebody up in the office, cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causing nothing but problems. And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government. I'm lovin' it, I shoveled s*** all my life, and now I'm dumping it on,"" he raps.
In the final section of the song, Eminem unloads on Cheney as well as Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore. Tipper Gore co-founded the Parents Music Resource Center known for its ""Parental Advisory"" stickers.
""(I am) the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress, and p**s on the lawns of the White House, to burn the ??flag?? and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker, to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy,"" he raps.
He continues in personal language.
""F*** you, Ms. Cheney! F*** you, Tipper Gore! F*** you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have. F*** you!""
Trump: 'Slim Shady is a winner'
Eminem's politics have sometimes trended more toward satire than anger. In an odd TV special back in 2004, Slim Shady led the ""Shady National Convention,"" a fake political convention hosted by Carson Daly and Vanessa Lachey.
A suit-wearing Slim Shady accepted the nomination for the ""Shady Party and Stuff."" But before he did that, the rapper was introduced by none other than Donald Trump, then known more for his wealth than his political skills.
""When the Shady Party called and told me there's going to be a convention, I said it's gotta be a really big one and it's gotta be right here in New York, because this is the best city anywhere in the world, am I right?"" Trump said. ""Of course I'm right. I'm always right. I'm Donald Trump, I'm always right.""
""I know a winner when I see one. And Donald Trump is telling you right now Slim Shady is a winner,"" he added. ""He's got brains, he's got guts, and he's got Donald Trump's vote.""
Eminem then took the stage and explained his reasons for running as a candidate, tongue firmly in cheek.
""Why me, you ask? Why Eminem? Well, let me tell you why if you would shut up for one second. Democrats and Republicans alike, and that other guy, they had conventions and they looked cooler than this one, but so what? So what, I say to them.
""What am I running for, you ask? I don't run from anything,"" he said. ""That's the thing. I tackle the issues head on.""
Bill and Hillary Clinton
In his song ""Role Model"" on The Slim Shady LP in 1999, Eminem raps about then-President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton.
""So if I said I never did drugs, that would mean I lie and get f***ed more than the President does,"" he says.
Eminem, who has often been criticized for violent, misogynistic and anti-gay language , then attacks Hillary Clinton.
""Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert. I ripped her f***ing tonsils out and fed her sherbet -- b****,"" he raps."
Las Vegas False Flag: Ex-Cop Points Out Mystery In Vegas Shooting Window,"(Before It's News)
What did the media possibly overlook? Frm. Officer points out a problem with the story. In the below video, ex-cop points mustery in Las Vegas shooting window.
 
 
The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.

Alex Jones Predicted Las Vegas Massacre To Kick Off 100 Yr. Anniversary Of Bolshevik Revolution. Shooter was on the 32nd floor, OJ Simpsons jersey number was 32 He was released the same day.
 
From the Friday Sept 29th Show Alex Jones correctly predicted the Oct 1st shooting as a pretexts to kick off a Civil War in America.
 
 
What is a False-Flag?
 
What exactly is a false flag, why is it called false flag?
 
The term false-flag is a naval term from the age of sail that refers to a ship flying the colors (flag) of a country other than the one the ship belonged. This was done for multiple reasons but a common one was to lure an enemy vessel into gun or boarding range and then at the last moment drop the false flag and run up the true colors before attacking. It was fair sport to use false flags but considered immoral/unethical to attack under one.
 
To the point that it was never done.
 
But that was a different age…
 
The simplest definition of a false-flag is an event in which the actual perpetrators and the reported or blamed perpetrators are different. The classic use of a false-flag, and hence the military origin of it’s name, goes as follows.
 
Country A’s King wants to conquer and loot Country B’s land to enrich himself. Of course if this is what King A tells his army they may choose not to fight or revolt. Or best case their effort will be lacking. In order to get the most out of their soldiers, the commanders need them to be emotionally involved… anger, hatred, revenge.
 
Now the skilled orator and manipulator might be able to create this mood with just words. But not many have this level of skill. It is much easier to motivate and/or raise an army if one’s country has been attacked, hence you are acting in defense. And this is where the false flag comes in. Country A’s King and its top General(s) conspire to launch an attack against itself, claiming that the attackers were from Country B.
 
The attack needs to be big enough to create real panic and fear, and for maximum affect there needs to be real deaths. The attackers need be convincing in their role as soldiers of Country B, so clothes, uniform, weapons need to match appropriately.
 
The likely hood of success of the attack is high since it would be unexpected or a surprise attack. Even if the attack were to technically fail, the fact alone of an attack might be enough to manipulate a response. King A could use men from within to execute the attack, or it might be better to use mercenaries.
 
Regardless, a successful attack will incense the populace against the ‘evil’ Country B, and therefore justify an invasion.
 The above is just one example, or a classic example of a false-flag. However, it is very important to understand that the false-flag event can take on countless forms. I recently read a comment where the commentator stated that because actual people died it was not a false-flag. The defining characteristic of a false-flag is not it’s specific type or whether or not non-actors died, or even if the event occurred at all, meaning the entire reported event is a fabrication.
 
One defining characteristic is that the real perpetrator is never known or revealed. So the author or director/producer of the ‘production’ is unknown. The audience’s attention is locked on the stage, the villain, clearly identified through the official narrative, is known.
 
But who are behind the curtains? When a staged play is sold as real then the actors become irrelevant, what is important is who are the Producers! Who are the people that wrote, directed, and funded the event? These are the real perpetrators, not the actors on the stage.
 
Cui Bono?… Who Benefits?
 
The other defining characteristic is that the event is a catalyst for the true objectives. Thus the false-flag uses the classic Hegelian dialectic of ‘Problem-Reaction-Solution’.
 
From the example above, the surprise attack is the ‘problem’ (a threat to personal safety), the population’s anger, fear, concern is the desired ‘reaction’, and the ‘solution’ is to invade the offender to eliminate the threat which is enabled by the populations reaction.
 
The false-flag then is a deliberately created illusion whose purpose is create the environment in which the objective or ‘solution’ will be accepted and thus implemented.
 
 Why use False-Flags?
 
As explained in the previous section the classic false-flag was used to justify an invasion of another country.
 
But there are numerous motivations for using false-flags. Thus the false-flag event has been used throughout history to initiate change. Problem-Reaction-Solution.
 
If the change that the leader(s) want is not going to be wanted or accepted by the population then the false-flag is an excellent tool in order enact said change.
 
So the false-flag is a tool of manipulation (deception) to direct the opinions and actions of the populace. This problem-reaction-solution model of the false-flag is but one tool of the social engineers who are directing the actors on the world stage.
 
While the audience, the 99.9% of the world, much more than just mere spectators, are directly affected by these ‘engineers’ from the moment of their birth until the time of their passing.
 
They (we) are actually unknowing-unwilling participants in the machinations of the 1%.
 
Göring: Why, of course, the people don’t want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece?
 
Naturally, the common people don’t want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood.
 
But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.
 
Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.
 
Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
 
It works the same way in any country.

 Reality-based Community
 
The source of the term is a quotation in an October 17, 2004, The New York Times Magazine article by writer Ron Suskind, “Faith, Certainty and the Presidency of George W. Bush,” quoting an unnamed aide to George W. Bush (later attributed to Karl Rove):
 
“The aide said that guys like me were ‘in what we call the reality-based community,’ which he defined as people who ‘believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality’.”
 
“That’s not the way the world really works anymore,” he continued.
 
“We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality – judiciously, as you will – we’ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out.
 
We’re history’s actors… and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.”
 
On December 1st of 1941, 80+% of the US population was against getting involved in the war in Europe.
 
 FDR wanted the US to join the war, a now well established fact. So how does FDR convince the US population to participate in a war across the ocean that they do not want to be in?
 
 The US took 8 steps to incense the Japanese and encourage or force them to attack. The US had broken the diplomatic and military codes of the Japanese in the 30?s.
 
 The US knew what they were up to. The Japanese diplomats were to declare war on the morning of Dec 7 before the attack, but this meeting was intentionally delayed. Thus the claim of a ‘surprise’ attack could be maintained, and the surprise, horror, shock of the attack was used to manipulate the population into joining WWII.
 
 The Army and Naval commanders (General Walter Short and Admiral Husband Kimmel) at Pearl Harbor, who were blamed for failing to be ready and immediately dismissed, were both exonerated in ’44.
 
 Both the Navy Court and the Army Board found Washington guilty, that officials within the US Govt knew the attack was coming but failed to pass this information on to the appropriate personnel. 
 
 Proven False-Flags
 
 
 
Iran-Contra
 
 
 
Watergate
 
 
 
Operation Gladio
 
 
 
Operation Northwoods
 
 
 
Gulf of Tonkin
 
 
 
Pearl Harbor
 
 
 
So you’re not convinced false-flags are real.
 
Fair enough, nothing wrong with being skeptical. Let’s then look at events that have been ‘officially’ exposed. One of the most significant is Operation Gladio, for not only was it blown wide open, but it clearly demonstrates state sponsored terrorism.
 
After WWII British MI6 and the CIA created and supported right-wing terrorist groups throughout Europe in which many innocents were killed. The purpose was to blame the terrorism on left-wing groups, using a ‘strategy of tension’, and thus gain support for more government powers.
 
This program went on for many decades, and though officially Gladio may have shut down, it obviously continues unabated:

Smart Devices Are Snitching on Owners and Rewriting the Criminal Justice System,"By Nicholas West
A new type of court case is slowly but steadily emerging within the American legal system: alleged crimes being detected from data supplied by smart devices.
Several cases over the last few years have focused on data transmitted within the modern smart home, while a couple of others add an extra dimension of police completely reconstructing a crime scene based upon data collected from the home as well as the various Internet-connected devices that we wear.
The very nature of the 1st, 4th and 5th Amendments to the Constitution appears to be at stake.
In December of last year an Arkansas murder case made headlines not so much for the death itself, but how a suspect was brought into custody. James Bates hosted a party at his Bentonville home on the night of November 21st, 2015. At some point during the event a man drowned in a hot tub on the property. Bates claimed to have found the victim the next morning when he awoke, stating that it was a tragic accident, but Arkansas police obtained smart water meter readings that showed an anomaly between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. Based solely on this data – and obtained without a warrant – Bates was arrested and charged with 1st degree murder.
Somewhat ironically, James Bates subsequently requested recordings from his Amazon Echo to defend himself against these charges, which resulted in Amazon waiving their standard privacy conditions.
A second case followed wherein we saw a police narrative emerge that a crime had been prevented by a home’s smart system. A domestic dispute resulted in Eduardo Barros allegedly wielding a firearm against his girlfriend and threatening to kill her. However, during the argument he exclaimed, “Did you call the sherrifs?” This activated a voice-controlled sound system in his home and dialed 911. After an hours-long standoff, the suspect was taken into custody and charged. Law enforcement was quick to hail the smart technology as having “saved a life.” But it was the presiding judge who shook privacy advocates by accepting the evidence regardless of how it was obtained, saying that there was indeed probable cause for the arrest without a warrant.
But it is the bizarre case of Richard Dabate, as recounted in the Chicago Tribune that offers up new complexities in the argument about how far police should be able to go in obtaining information and using it to investigate crimes.
Two days before Christmas, 2015, Connecticut police received a distress call from a man who claimed that an intruder killed his wife and tortured him. He was found in the home’s basement tied to a chair and bleeding. Richard told an apparently detailed story of the events that led up to the break-in, which included recounting how his smartphone alerted him to the intrusion while driving to work. He stated that he sent an e-mail to his company and gave the time of his arrival home at around 8:45 a.m. He says he entered the home and confronted the intruder. Meanwhile, his wife returned from a morning exercise class. Richard claims that he told his wife to run, but she was pursued and shot by the intruder, upon which the man dragged Richard to the basement, tied him to a chair and tortured him. The details of how he managed to dial 911 after fending off the attacker were even more dramatic: “Richard said he crawled upstairs with the chair still attached, activated the panic alarm, called 911 and collapsed. The firefighter found him soon after.”
During the course of the investigation, police realized that Richard’s wife Connie was wearing a Fitbit – a wearable device with a feature that tracks how many steps a person takes while exercising or going about their daily activities. The numbers didn’t match according to Richard’s account of what had happened, differing by a wide margin. Nor did the records from Richard’s smart key, which show that his alarm was activated at 8:50 a.m., then turned off at 8:59 p.m – from his basement. His email, which he claimed was sent from the road, actually showed that he sent it from his home IP address. Richard was arrested and now awaits judgment after pleading not guilty.
The Tribune noted one additional case where even a man’s pacemaker snitched him out to police. He claimed that he woke up to his house on fire, but after police summoned records of his cardiac rhythm, he was found to have been awake at the time the blaze began. He was arrested and charged for arson and insurance fraud.
The cases thus far seem to highlight instances where justice very well could have been served upon the guilty. Is this a sign that the American justice system is being diligent with the cases it pursues? Or is the precedent being set to drastically widen the scope in the future, opening the door for false arrests based upon faulty digital readings and/or hacks?
Ninety-nine percent of crime will now have a digital component … We have these little sensors all over. We’re wearing them and they’re in our homes. — Jonathan Rajewski, a digital forensics instructor at Champlain College in Vermont. (Source) It will definitely be something in five or 10 years, in every case, we will look to see if this information is available — Virginia State Police Special Agent Robert Brown III of the High Technology Division.

Kenya vote in balance as crisis deepens after Odinga quits,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya lurched deeper into political confusion on Wednesday as a court ruling and a parliamentary vote appeared to ease Uhuru Kenyatta’s path to a second term as president, a day after his chief rival quit an election they were to contest.
Kenyatta and Raila Odinga were due to face off in a repeat election on Oct. 26, after the Supreme Court annulled their August ballot - in which the president was declared the winner.
But Odinga pulled out of the re-run on Tuesday, fuelling doubts about whether it would be contested at all. Wednesday’s interventions by the judiciary and legislature added to the uncertainty.
As police used teargas to disperse opposition protesters demanding electoral reform, the High Court approved a petition by Ekuru Aukot, who polled less than 1 percent in the August vote, to contest the second ballot.
The election board later issued a statement saying that all eight candidates who competed in August would be on the ballot. It also said although Odinga had notified them of his withdrawal by letter, he had not yet submitted the official form to do so.
The developments suggested that the second election would go ahead, with Kenyatta the likely winner against a plethora of weaker candidates. No challenger except Odinga polled more than 1 percent.
Further muddying the political waters, parliament passed an election law amendment stating that if one candidate withdrew from the re-run vote, the remaining one would automatically win. The vote was boycotted by opposition lawmakers.
The law aimed to ensure Kenyatta could be declared president if he faced no challengers.
The events stoked confusion among voters and fears that politically-driven violence might escalate. Months of political uncertainty have already blunted growth in East Africa’s richest nation, a long-time ally of the West.
“There’s a real atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty. There seems to be dozens of opinions of what should come next,” said Murithi Mutiga, a senior Horn of Africa analyst for the global thinktank International Crisis Group.
UNEASE
Justifying his pullout on Tuesday, Odinga said the election would not be free and fair and renewed calls for the electoral board (IEBC), which he blamed for the procedural irregularities identified in the first ballot, to be replaced.
Opposition supporters on Wednesday renewed their protests for electoral reform.

Demonstrators lit bonfires in Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold in the country’s west, while more than a thousand supporters marched through the central business district in the capital Nairobi. Police used teargas to disperse them in both cities, witnesses said.
Juliana Otieno, the chief executive of the Oginga Odinga Hospital in the city, said 17 people had been admitted with injuries suffered during the protests. A Reuters witness counted at least five of them with bullet wounds.
Kisumu’s police commander, Titus Yoma, said he had no information on the bullet wounds and his officers were still quelling the protests, which were centered around two slums in the lakeside city.
At least 37 people were killed in protests immediately following the August vote, almost all of them by police, a Kenyan rights group said on Monday. Ethnic clashes killed 1,200 people following a disputed presidential poll in 2007.
“We want a reformed IEBC,” said Elisha Odhiambo, an opposition legislator, referring to the electoral board, which has frequently relied on riot police dispersing protests outside its offices in recent weeks.
Slideshow (4 Images)
Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho, a key opposition player, told protesters in Uhuru Park: “Our voices must be heard. We have no war with anyone but we will not allow anyone to stifle us.”
After the High Court ruling in his favor, Aukot told reporters that he still had concerns about the board and would issue a statement in a day or two giving clarity about his plans.
It was unclear if other candidates from the first ballot with little support would also seek to be included, but the election board said it still had time to print ballot papers.
The Sept. 1 Supreme Court judgment that nullified Kenyatta’s 1.4 million vote win also stipulated elections had to be held within 60 days.
If that schedule is not met, the constitution provides for the speaker of parliament, a member of Kenyatta’s party, to take power.
With two weeks to go until the elections, it is still unclear who will stand.
“I would expect one of the parties will try to seek an authoritative announcement from the Supreme Court,” International Crisis Group’s Mutiga said.
Amid the political uncertainty, the government has trimmed this year’s GDP growth forecast from 5.9 percent to 5.5 percent last month.
The country’s equity markets slid further on Wednesday. Kenya’s all share index closed down 0.67 percent while the blue chip index fell 1.41 percent."
290 arrests in anti-Putin march on Russian leader's birthday,"St. Petersburg, Russia (CNN) Russian police arrested 290 protesters in 26 cities as marches took place against President Vladimir Putin on the leader's 65th birthday, according to independent monitoring group OVD.
Thousands attended the marches on Saturday, held by supporters of Putin's only real political opponent, activist Alexei Navalny, who is serving a 20-day jail term for organizing an unauthorized public meeting.
It is very difficult to legally organize protests in Russia, where public assembly laws have been tightened several times since Putin's current presidential term began in 2012.
Demonstrators gather by a statue of poet Alexander Pushkin in an anti-Putin rally in Moscow on Saturday.
Navalny, 41, has said he intends to run for president in the next election, despite carrying an embezzlement conviction that prevents him from doing so. He claims that conviction was bogus and politically motivated to block his presidential bid.

"Whites in U.K. Own More Homes but Are Doing Worse in School, Audit Finds","The audit found that the unemployment rate for black, Asian and other ethnic-minority people, at 8 percent, was nearly double that of white British adults, at 4.6 percent. And the difference was larger in the north of the country than in the south.
“People who have lived with discrimination don’t need a government audit to make them aware of the scale of the challenge,” Mrs. May said on Tuesday. “But this audit means that for society as a whole — for government, for our public services — there is nowhere to hide. These issues are now out in the open. And the message is very simple: If these disparities cannot be explained, then they must be changed.”
Other key data from the report revealed significant inequality in homeownership, showing that white people and those with Indian and Pakistani backgrounds were more likely to own homes than were black people and those from a Bangladeshi background, even after taking into account age, income and socioeconomic group.

The audit also showed how some white British groups were falling behind in education compared with Chinese and Asian groups. Attainment data showed that white British primary school students eligible for free school meals — a program widely used as a proxy for poverty — performed worse than any other group, with only 32 percent reaching the expected level.
A study published last year by the Sutton Trust, an education charity, found that while poverty lowered educational outcomes, disadvantaged students from Chinese, Bangladeshi and black African backgrounds tended to perform better than their white working-class peers.
“Several explanations have been proposed for this shift,” the Sutton Trust report said. “The popularity of private tutors among ethnic groups and the latter’s concentration in large urban areas such as London (where average results have improved in recent years, with some suggesting that ethnic minorities have driven this progress), the impact of supplementary schools, and differing levels of parental aspiration, among others.”

At the time of Britain’s latest national census, in 2011, about 86 percent of people described themselves as white, with 80.5 percent saying white British. Around 7.5 percent said they were Asian or Asian British — those with Indian backgrounds made up the largest section of this group, followed by those from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds — and around 3.3 percent described themselves as black, African/Caribbean, or black British.
The data from Tuesday’s audit was published on a new government “Ethnicity Facts and Figures” website, which will be kept up-to-date by a specialist unit, the prime minister’s office said in a statement.

While the report has been welcomed by members of Parliament, government institutions and charities working to tackle the issues laid out in the report, they have called for a comprehensive and coherent strategy that will result in action.
“Only by taking focused action to tackle race inequality can Britain become a fair country in which individuals can reach their potential and our communities can live and work together to create a strong economy and a cohesive society,” said David Isaac, the chairman of Britain’s public anti-discrimination body, The Equality and Human Rights Commission.
On Tuesday, the government introduced several programs to address some of the disparities identified in the audit.
The Department for Work and Pensions began a series of programs and measures to tackle unemployment in 20 hot-spot areas, including training and mentoring programs for minorities. The Department for Education announced a review on how and when pupils were suspended or expelled from schools, something the audit found happened disproportionately to children from Roma, Irish Traveler and black Caribbean backgrounds.
The government also reiterated its commitment to consider some recommendations from a report by the opposition lawmaker David Lammy on how the criminal justice system treats people from ethnic minorities."

Just because the Colts got into the win column last week and Jacoby Brissett has emerged as a sneaky, cheap, quarterback option, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t target Indianapolis. While the Colts did score 31 points last week, it came against the 0-3 Browns and in three games Brissett only has three total touchdowns (one passing and two rushing). Last week was rough for Seattle as the Titans put up 33 points, but in the prior two games they allowed a total of 26 points. Seattle is not as strong of an option as they once were, they are still a solid defense with some of the same players from when they were a top defense off the board. The main issue is that need to create turnovers, with two interceptions. They will also benefit as the Colts have allowed 11 sacks, Seattle has six, which makes them one of the top plays this week.
It has been a forgettable start to the season for New England’s defense. Through three games they have given up an average of 32 points and 461 yards, and the initial thought would be to look the other way. The Patriots get what could turn out to be a gift this week as they face Cam Newton and the Panthers. I’m not sure how much that should count for since New England gave up 27 points to a rookie quarterback last week, but Newton has not looked good and was the first signal caller to struggle against New Orleans’ defense. If you are looking for positives, the Patriots did pick off DeShaun Watson twice last week and they have averaged two sacks a week. I have a hard time betting against New England, and if your streaming options aren’t great there are worse things than holding on. That is especially true, since there aren’t many slam dunk match-ups this week.
This isn’t about targeting the Jets as much as it is giving credit to Jacksonville. After almost shutting out the Ravens last week, perhaps the Jaguars defense is truly a legitimate fantasy option for this season. When they held the Texans to just seven points in the season opener while coming up with an interception, three fumble recoveries and scoring a touchdown, that was chalked up to Tom Savage more than anything else. It looked like the bounced back to earth in a big way by giving up 37 points to the Titans, but it’s hard to argue with the success they had last week. Despite the 20 points New York scored last week, they are still not an intimidating offense.

Last year, Drexel University professor George Ciccariello-Maher made the wrong kind of headlines when he tweeted, “All I want for Christmas is white genocide.”
Some eleven months later, the leftist professor seems to have gotten his wish. And shortly after a deranged gunman slayed nearly 60 people and injured more than 500 others in one of the most devastating acts of violence in our country’s history, this waste of space again took to Twitter to blame white privilege, mainstream liberals, and Donald Trump for the slaying.
“A white man,” Ciccariello-Maher first tweeted, accentuating the identity of the shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock. “It’s the white supremacist patriarchy, stupid.”
Sensing that perhaps these tweets were not quite enough to get his bizarre point across, the politics professor expounded considerably.
“But liberals will drown out all discourse with a deafening chorus screeching ‘gun control,’” he wrote. “To believe that someone who would shoot down 50 people wouldn’t circumvent any gun law you pass is the height of delusion. But liberal escapism means talking about easy questions and proposing easy non-solutions rather than talking about who kills and why.
“White people and men are told that they are entitled to everything,” he continued. “This is what happens when they don’t get what they want. The narrative of white victimization has been gradually built over the past 40 years. It is the spinal column of Trumpism, and most extreme form is the white genocide myth. Yesterday was a morbid symptom of what happens when those who believe they deserve to own the world also think it is being stolen from them.”
It’s no easy feat to simultaneously be wise enough to see through the Democrats’ call for gun control and idiotic enough to believe there is some national concept of “whiteness” to blame for this mass murder, but somehow Ciccariello-Maher accomplishes the task. His rant is another window into the disturbing fringe left that is trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from the “liberals” so that they can take it into an ideological dead-end: Pure, unadulterated Communism. They don’t believe in “gun control” because when they get in power, there won’t BE any guns to control.
Well, that’s the idea, anyway.
The truth is that America will never succumb to this latest, tasteless surge of Red Politics; freedom and Communism cannot co-exist. There is still too much of the former woven into the cloth of this country for the latter to ever gain a significant foothold. Especially if its messengers can barely restrain themselves from preaching openly the “evils of white men.”
Still, they walk among us, teach at our universities, and infect social media with their outlandish theories. We can’t afford to ignore them, because they are using pure propaganda to radicalize millions of young people who don’t know any better. And while we’re quite certain that freedom, democracy, and American values will win in the end, things are bound to get a little worse before they get better.

The Baltimore Ravens will spend the week trying desperately to keep the season from unraveling.
A pair of losses already has the team scrambling for answers, especially on offense.
Quarterback Joe Flacco has thrown for one touchdown with four interceptions over the recent two-game skid. The Ravens were outscored 44-0 in the first half of those games and simply could not recover because they are not built to play from behind.
There doesn’t appear to be any quick-fix solutions to the problems.
“Everything that we do on offense is a little bit aided, either by turnovers, good field position, stuff like that,” Flacco said. “We’re not creating a lot for ourselves right now. We’re just going the hard way. Obviously, with that one long run, it popped, but besides that one long run, we’re not getting any big plays. There’s a couple out there, we’re just missing them.”
Flacco missed all of training camp with an ailing back. However, he said numerous times that injury has not affected his performance.
In four games this season, Flacco has completed just 73 of 118 pass attempts for 601 yards with four touchdowns and six interceptions.
The loss of right guard Marshal Yanda to a season-ending ankle injury cannot be overstated. Yanda is the anchor of the offensive and that unit has struggled without him in the lineup.
Flacco has also been sacked six times over the past two games and has been limited to mostly check-downs because he doesn’t have time to look downfield.
The Ravens have the 31st-ranked passing offense with 570 yards, just ahead of Miami (548).
“We’ve got to be better off early in games,” Flacco said. “So, that’s the type of game that’s going to benefit us right now, is being good early and then putting teams away. And when we’re trying to climb back in games like we were today, there’s opportunities to do it, and we weren’t good enough to do it. That starts with me. I wasn’t good enough to get us back in the game.”
The Ravens defense was expected to help carry the team. While that was the case in a pair of victories to open the season, that unit has also struggled in the recent losses. The team has sorely missed defensive tackle Brandon Williams, who missed the last two games with a foot injury.
Without Williams in the lineup, the Jacksonville Jaguars amassed 166 rushing yards in a 44-7 victory Week 3 in London. The Ravens then had no answer for Le’Veon Bell, who had 144 yards on 35 carries with two touchdowns in Pittsburgh’s 26-9 win.
Still, the Ravens were not using the absence of Williams as an excuses for their struggles against the run.
“In a sense, it affects us,” linebacker C.J. Mosley said. “The next guy has to step up. When he comes back, we’ll be ready for him. But we just can’t make that [as an] excuse. If anything, the guy that’s behind him have got to see what he does on those types of runs, or watch a little more film and see what you need to work on for those types of runs. You’ve got to figure it out as a whole group.”
The Ravens face another tough challenge this week in Oakland. The cross-country travel certainly is going to be an added challenge.
From there, the Ravens can get back on track with two of the next three games at home against the Chicago Bears and Miami Dolphins. Baltimore has a challenging road trip to Minnesota in between those games.
The Ravens are trying to avoid missing the playoffs for the fourth time in five years. Harbaugh expects things to turn around. He might be more optimistic than his fan base.
“We’ve been worse than 2-2 here before and come back and gone to the AFC Championship,” Harbaugh said. “So, that’s what you do. This is a long season in the National Football League, so we go to work.”

Breakingviews - Beijing’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Xi Jinping’s closer embrace is bad news for Big Tech. China’s government wants stakes and board seats at web giants like Tencent, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Beijing is already influential behind the scenes in technology, and given its tightening grip elsewhere, a power grab in this vital sector was all but inevitable. This will nonetheless cost investors.
China’s bureaucrats have held discussions with Tencent, microblog-operator Weibo, and a video-streaming platform owned by e-commerce group Alibaba, according to the Journal, which cited people close to the companies. State-backed funds would buy a 1 percent stake via “special management shares” allowing them to put a government official on the board. The powerful internet watchdog has already trialled this arrangement with two startups, the newspaper said.
Xi’s government is increasing its control on everything from traditional media to private conglomerates like Dalian Wanda and Anbang. So, Beijing’s latest focus on social media and internet companies was to be expected.
To be sure, too, the government already exerts substantial sway over the sector. Tough censorship and capital controls mean bosses like Tencent’s Pony Ma need good relations with regulators. He and rivals like Jack Ma of Alibaba are also increasingly pushing into sensitive sectors like cloud computing and finance.
That said, government intervention in decision-making will have far more impact. Recently tech groups including Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com injected $12 billion into state-owned telecom Unicom, as part of the government’s “mixed-ownership” reform. That could be the first of a series of politically motivated investments. So capital allocation could get worse.
Foreign scrutiny of Chinese takeovers is already increasing, and politicians in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are pushing for even tighter controls based on national security concerns. The $1 billion acquisition of U.S.-based MoneyGram by Ant Financial, Jack Ma’s financial-technology group, has been delayed, with the buyer having to refile an application, Reuters reported last month. Having direct state backing will make it much harder for these groups to argue they are independent actors."
"Cash, T-Shirts and Gallons of Booze: How Liberian Candidates Woo Voters","Mr. Joe, a “pen-pen” motorcycle driver, routinely wears different T-shirts representing opposing political candidates, depending on whom he is hitting up for money, food or rides on a particular day.
Standing next to Mr. Joe, Daniel Kollie, 30, his friend and fellow pen-pen driver, nodded vigorously. The very palaver hut in which both of them, and around 15 of their pals, were holding court in the Congo Town neighborhood of Monrovia, he explained, was paid for by a local independent candidate for the Liberian Legislature, Albert J. B. Cooper.
In addition to funding the pen-pen drivers’ palaver hut — a sort-of community gathering area — Mr. Cooper also gave them 2000 Liberian dollars (the equivalent of around $20) last month, the young men said.
But the money did not stop Mr. Kollie from wearing a white T-shirt adorned with the face of one of Mr. Cooper’s rivals for the same District 10 seat in the House, Yekeh Kolubah. Mr. Kollie is not voting for him, either, though.
Truth is, he’s not planning to vote at all. But he, like thousands of drivers of pen-pens and keh kehs (three-wheeled taxis), is using the campaign season to take what he can from the candidates.
“We smart now,” Mr. Kollie said in Liberian English. “We know the scam. We are political scientists.” Around him, his friends muttered in agreement.
All across Monrovia, it has been the same story as Liberia counts down to Tuesday’s nationwide elections. The candidates hand out cash. They hire local women and install them in party headquarters behind coal fires to cook countless bags of rice and hearty Liberian-style stews — with potato greens, cassava leaf and palm butter — to feed their supporters.

They print hundreds of thousands of T-shirts with party logos and smiling faces promising prosperity for all. And they pass out booze by the gallons — marijuana-laced eggnog, hooch, Club Beer, Guinness, cane juice, palm wine, you name it.

In return, Liberians eat, drink, spend and pledge their loyalty — and then head to the next party headquarters to do the same thing, gleeful that, in their own small way, they are getting a little of their own back.
Abraham Sesay proclaimed he was “voting for Oppong,” referring to the former soccer player George Weah, also known as Oppong, who is running for president on the Congress for Democratic Change ticket.

But the T-shirt that Mr. Sesay, 26, wore sported the distinguished mien of Alexander B. Cummings Jr., the former Coca-Cola executive who is running for president on the Alternative National Congress, or A.N.C., ticket.
Mr. Sesay’s rationale was simple: “They gave it to me for free.”
In a poor country where the economic recovery that began after the civil wars ended in 2003 was obliterated by the Ebola epidemic in 2014 and a fall in commodity prices, a free T-shirt, a plate of rice and palm butter, along with $20, is a big deal.
Despite the progress made since the end of the war, many people here still scratch out a hand-to-mouth existence, as they have for almost 200 years.
That is why, when the presidential candidate Oscar Cooper was recently videotaped standing in a doorway handing out cash to Liberians, few people here were surprised.
That video simply joined a seemingly endless supply on Liberian social media of cash-for-votes videos, including one showing a woman wearing a “Charles Brumskine for President” T-shirt and a handbag around her neck and angrily announcing that she had not been given the 500 Liberian dollars ($4.50) that she had been promised for showing up at a Brumskine rally.
Almost every day for the past 10 months, a woman known as Mother Comfort Lloyd and her 30 helpers have prepared rice, spicy peppery soup and potato greens to hand out to supporters at Mr. Weah’s headquarters in the Monrovia neighborhood called Fish Market. Around 3:30 in the afternoon, the line forms and snakes through the grounds.

Jacob Wuray, 23, of Congo Town, said he came every day to eat. When the legislative candidates show up in their big cars to hand out cash, he is there to receive his 250 Liberian dollars (around $2.25).
Does he plan to vote for Mr. Weah? He laughed and said, “Ask me if I even got voter I.D. card?”
Down the road, at Mr. Cummings’s headquarters, a frenzy was underway for free T-shirts. Under swollen skies, a young woman pressed against Justin P. Zigbuo, an A.N.C. official. “You can help me with campaign shirt?” she asked him.
A few feet away, Princess Gray, 32, had brought a white towel, which she was getting printed with Mr. Cummings’s logo and face. Six years ago, Ms. Gray said, she had voted for Mr. Weah for president. But this time around, she said, she was voting for Mr. Cummings.
Why?
“Because I love him,” she said.
Why does she love him?
“He gave my two sons 14,000 dollars for scholarships,” she said. That’s the equivalent of $120, for her 8-year-old twins, Prince and Princeton, both second-graders, to go to school.
In this case, Mr. Cummings’s gambit appears to have worked.
“I love him,” Ms. Gray repeated. “And I will vote for him.”"
Yosemite park rock fall: Tributes to 'hero' climber,"Image copyright Facebook/Andrew and Lucy Foster Image caption Mr Foster, who moved to Cardiff for university, was a sales representative for an outdoor clothing firm
The family of a climber from Wales killed shielding his wife from a rock fall in California have said he will ""always be our hero"" for saving her.
Andrew Foster, 32, originally from Cheltenham, died when rocks fell from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park on 27 September.
His wife Lucy, 28, who was seriously injured and is recovering in hospital, was protected by her husband's body.
Mr Foster's family said they were so proud of their ""brave boy"".
In a statement, they said they wake up every morning hoping his death had been a ""bad dream"".
""As has already been reported, Andrew died whilst shielding Lucy and, indeed, we understand another climber witnessed him running back to the rock fall to protect Lucy,"" his family said.
""They loved each other dearly and, while our loss is indescribable, we are so proud of our brave boy in saving Lucy; he will always be our hero.""

Mrs Foster's family said he was ""the man of her dreams"".
""We take some comfort from the fact that Andy's last act of love saved Lucy's life. Both families are supporting each other at this incredibly difficult time of loss and sadness,"" they said.
The families said she was stable in hospital and the friends the couple had been climbing with had been at her hospital bedside.
They said they were now focused on getting his body back to the UK.
The El Capitan rock formation is the world's largest granite monolith and one of the best-known landmarks in Yosemite.
The pair, found with climbing equipment, are believed to have been scouting out the ascent from a trail when a ""sheet"" of granite plummeted from a height of 200m (656ft).
Mr Foster proposed to his wife in the Alps in 2015 and the couple married last year.
He went to Cleeve School in Bishop's Cleeve, Gloucestershire, before going to Cardiff University in 2003 to study engineering.
In 2006, he began working for the Cardiff-based outdoor activity shop Up and Under, before joining the international company Patagonia.
Mrs Foster is originally from Staffordshire and went to school in Market Drayton, Shropshire."

(Before It's News)
The Chicago Cubs and Washington Nationals are slated to start their 2017 National League Division Series on Friday night in our nation’s capital. We don’t know who the Cubs will pitch in Game 1 and it was thought that the Nationals would throw ace Max Scherzer. But that might have changed after Scherzer suffered a hamstring injury on Saturday night. An MRI revealed that Scherzer “tweaked” his hamstring and now his availability for Game 1 might be in doubt. The ace hasn’t been officially ruled out of being the starter but this is pretty big. Manager Dusty Baker said that the injury could affect the rotation come Friday. “Probably,” Nationals manager Dusty Baker told reporters via CBS Chicago. “But he’s going to be fine. It’s just a matter of we got to determine when that is.” The Nationals rotation has been fantastic all season long led by Scherzer, Gio Gonzalez and Stephen Strasburg. It’s a tough test for the Cubs no matter what, seemingly having to beat one of those pitchers at least twice to win the series. But if Scherzer is indeed moved to Game 3 and has to pitch on the road, it might be some bad news for the Bears based on this stat: https://twitter.com/jonmorosi/status/914857506316390400 Scherzer was 16-6 with a 2.51 ERA and .90 WHIP in the regular season, leading the Nationals rotation. He’s faced the Cubs one time this season, throwing 6 innings and allowing just 1 earned run getting the win. Check back for more as both teams will announce their Game 1 starter this week.

Rugby League World Cup: Sam Tomkins not in England squad,"Sam Tomkins won the Man of Steel award in 2012
Rugby League World Cup on the BBC Venues: Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea Dates: 27 October to 2 December Coverage: Watch live coverage and highlights on BBC TV, Connected TV, online & the BBC Sport app and listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live.
Wigan's Sam Tomkins has missed out on a place in England's 24-man squad for the Rugby League World Cup in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.
Castleford Tigers' Zak Hardaker, who like Tomkins could have played at full-back, is also not selected, after he tested positive for cocaine.
Warrington forward Ben Currie and St Helens prop Alex Walmsley - both of whom are uncapped - are called up.
Hooker James Roby returns after a two-year absence from the team.
Wigan loose forward Sean O'Loughlin captains a squad featuring seven NRL-based players, including South Sydney Rabbitohs duo Sam and Tom Burgess.
James Graham and Gareth Widdop of the St George Illawarra Dragons, Canberra Raiders pair Josh Hodgson and Elliott Whitehead, and Cronulla Sharks' Chris Heighington are also included.
England head coach Wayne Bennett said: ""The competitiveness of Super League and NRL, and knowing the goal of playing for your country in a World Cup, has made many raise their game and become better athletes.
""The England programme has been very active leading into this tournament and having the squad meet up on regular occasions - on and off the field - has put us in a positive place before everyone gets into camp.""
All of England's matches will be broadcast live on BBC TV, radio and online.
Analysis
BBC Sport rugby league correspondent Dave Woods:
The absence of Sam Tomkins may have surprised a few, especially given Zak Hardaker is not available, but looking at this squad, Wayne Bennett would seem to have pencilled in St Helens' Jonny Lomax as his first-choice full-back.
Tomkins hasn't done enough since his return from injury to convince the England selectors that he's ready for the international stage.
Bennett has gone for size in the outside backs. Mark Percival is named in the 24, but don't be surprised if Leeds powerhouse Kallum Watkins and Ben Currie - usually a forward - are the picks in the centres.
Currie has only played a couple of games at the back end of the season for Warrington after a lengthy lay off with an anterior cruciate ligament problem, and has yet to win an England cap, but his pace and power make him a potentially stand out player.
You can't argue with James Roby's return after a two-year international absence, because he's been as dynamic as ever for Saints this year. Roby and Josh Hodgson make a world-class pairing to chose from at hooker.
It will be interesting to see what Bennett's choice is in the halves, but a couple of weeks out from the tournament beginning, Gareth Widdop and Luke Gale would seem to be the pairing of choice.
But a tournament played over a six-week period should mean just about everybody in the squad gets a go as form fluctuates and injuries occur.
But compared to other squads and the settled nature of this English set-up going into RLWC 2017, they have a very good chance of reaching the final at least.
Full squad: John Bateman, Kevin Brown, Sam Burgess, Tom Burgess, Ben Currie, Luke Gale, James Graham, Ryan Hall, Chris Heighington, Chris Hill, Josh Hodgson, Jonny Lomax, Jermaine McGillvary, Mike McMeeken, Sean O'Loughlin, Mark Percival, Stefan Ratchford, James Roby, Scott Taylor, Alex Walmsley, Kallum Watkins, Elliott Whitehead, Gareth Widdop, George Williams."

Theresa May speech marred by prankster Lee Nelson,"London (CNN) You know things are going badly when even the writing on the wall falls off.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's attempt to relaunch her faltering premiership was badly derailed Wednesday when a keynote speech was marred by an interruption from a prankster, a prolonged coughing fit and finally the disintegration of the stage set behind her.
An often excruciating address to members of her party was punctuated by coughs, splutters and brief interludes to sip water. May was left fighting to finish, barely audible, in front of a packed hall full of delegates at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester.
May, who lost her overall governing majority in the last election, had hoped to relaunch her premiership with her keynote speech. But soon after beginning her address, she was accosted by comedian Lee Nelson, real name Simon Brodkin, who strolled up to the stage and handed her a P45 -- a form that UK employees are given when they leave a company, similar to a ""pink slip"" in the US.
Hi @BorisJohnson , I gave Theresa her P45 just like you asked. pic.twitter.com/gzW0UluDMv
Brodkin, who has performed similar stunts in the past, including throwing money over former FIFA President Sepp Blatter at a press conference in 2015, told reporters that he was put up to it by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a former rival to May in her leadership bid. ""Boris told me to do it,"" he was heard as saying -- presumably in jest.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a throat lozenge given to her by Britain's Chancellor Philip Hammond .
While May managed to shrug off the incident as Brodkin was led away by security, she was unable to recover from coughing fits that plagued her.
To compound her misery, part of the stage furniture began to fall down as she continued to struggle on. Two letters fell from the slogan behind May, which had read: ""Building a country that works for everyone,"" until the ""F"" in ""for"" and the final ""E"" in ""everyone"" dropped to the ground.
An 'F' falls off the backdrop as British Prime Minister Theresa May delivers her keynote speech.
Delegates rose from the floor to cheer encouragement, while her finance minister, Phillip Hammond, came to the stage to offer a cough lozenge.
After the speech, the beleaguered Prime Minister tried to make light of the mishaps, posting a photograph on Twitter showing a view of her desk complete with a copy of her speech, her official red box and multiple types of cough medicines.
*coughs* pic.twitter.com/1b6CoW5Mrz — Theresa May (@theresa_may) October 4, 2017
Greater Manchester Police later said that Brodkin was briefly arrested but released shortly after.
Chief Superintendent John O'Hare confirmed that Brodkin had legitimate accreditation that gave him access to the conference site before adding that the accreditation process will be reviewed with the Conservative Party.
For May, the timing was particularly cruel, amid continued speculation over her leadership after the poor result in a general election she called for June.
She was fiercely criticized for calling the snap election and used the speech to apologize for a campaign that she labeled as ""too scripted, too presidential.""
Britain's Home Secretary Amber Rudd (C) listens to the speech by Prime Minister Theresa May.
""We did not get the victory we wanted because our national campaign fell short. It was too scripted, too presidential and it allowed the Labour party to paint us as the party of continuity when the public wanted to hear a message of change,"" she said.
""I hold my hands up for that. I take responsibility. I led the campaign, and I am sorry."""
"Food Truck Giving Free Food to Hurricane Workers, Kicked Out of Town for Not Having a Permit","By Matt Agorist
Green Cove Springs, FL — After Irma devastated Florida, most restaurants and stores were shut down in certain areas. Green Cove Springs was one of those places. So, when Jack Roundtree, owner of the Triple J BBQ food truck, arrived in town, not only was he welcomed with open arms — he was desperately needed. As he sold BBQ to paying customers, Roundtree used the extra money to feed utility workers for free for all their hard work. However, once officials saw a man who’d dare sell food in their town without paying them first, police were called in to make quick work of this entrepreneurial good Samaritan.
Shut down and get out of town—is what Roundtree was told by local authorities for both providing charity and a much-needed product and service. Why was Roundtree told to get out of town, you ask? Well, he hadn’t paid the local government for the ‘privilege’ to sell food to those in need inside Green Cove Springs.
Roundtree is no outlaw. In fact, Green Cove Springs actually encouraged him to sell his BBQ during their monthly Saturday-in-the-Park event before the hurricane. But not this time.
Even if he would’ve gone to city hall to buy a permit to sell during the Irma aftermath, however, he couldn’t—they were closed.
According to Clay Today:
It was interesting to learn that Roundtree and his truck were encouraged to serve customers during Green Cove’s monthly Saturday-in-the-Park event without a permit, but during Irma’s aftermath, not so much. Had Roundtree decided to press his case at City Hall, he would have been greeted with a sign that read: ‘Due to Hurricane Irma, City Hall offices and services will re-open on Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017.’
So, instead of allowing Roundtree to offer free food to utility workers and sell food to people during their time of need, and just get a permit after government employees decided to return to work—they just kicked him out of town.
Here’s how one Green Cove Spring witness, Bettie Tune, described the events at Rich’s on her Facebook page, as reported by Clay Today:
The irony here is that he was kicked out of town for failing to get a permit by government workers because the other government workers who would’ve given him this permit, were not at work.
In a report from the Institute for Justice, Communications Coordinator, Matt Powers explains that Roundtree is not alone.
Cities across the country often impose strict regulations that make it nearly impossible for food trucks to operate. In 2011, IJ launched its National Street Vending Initiative to fight these laws. In Baltimore, the Institute for Justice (IJ) is challenging a ban on food trucks parking within 300-foot of a brick-and-mortar business that sells the same type of food. In Chicago, IJ is challenging regulations that bans food trucks from operating within 200 feet of a brick-and-mortar business serving food and forces them to install GPS tracking devices that broadcast their every move. And IJ is challenging a Louisville, Kentucky, law banning food trucks from operating within 150 feet of any restaurant selling similar food.
These strict regulations are ostensibly designed for food safety, but in reality, serve to raise revenue for the state and limit established restaurants’ competition. They also stifle economic growth.
As the IJ noted:
FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad) It is not only during times of crisis that food trucks contribute to their communities. According to IJ’s report Streets of Dreams mobile vending businesses help people escape poverty and unemployment through affordable start-up costs which creates the initial economic opportunity for upward mobility. IJ’s report, Seven Myths and Realities found the presence of food trucks can actually help local restaurant industries by attracting new customers and serving as incubators for new restaurants. Cities should embrace food trucks and liberate them from onerous regulations so they can enjoy the benefits these businesses bring.
When people in need are denied food they are willing to purchase because government workers aren’t in the office to sell the maker of that food a permission slip, something is wrong in the land of the free.
As TFTP reported earlier this month, this problem is everywhere. It stifles local economic growth, persecutes the poor the hardest, and turns hard-working entrepreneurs into criminals, ripe for the extortion of state.
Luckily, thanks to Martin Flores, who filmed an innocent hot dog vendor named Beto get robbed by a Berkeley police officer for selling hot dogs, Americans are seeing the harsh reality that is making a living in a police state.

College Football: Mel Kiper and Todd Mcshay’s List of Most Exciting Players to Watch,"College Football: Mel Kiper and Todd Mcshay’s List of Most Exciting Players to Watch
(Before It's News)
.
It has been argued that scouting takes the joy out of football. Sometimes it is fun to simply watch a game unfold and to enjoy the athleticism of the players without losing oneself in their potential as future NFL stars.
Mel Kiper and Todd McShay spend their days looking at young talent, and they know how to spot a future NFL star. However, the players they have listed below have less to do with how they would have impacted the college football lines for Week 5 games and more to do with the fun they bring to the game.
If you are looking for talented athletes that are merely fun to watch, consider these guys:
+Saquon Barkley
As far as PSU Running Backs are concerned, Saquon is something special, at least on the college level. Forget about Leonard Fournette, this is a 230-pound player that makes lateral cuts he shouldn’t be capable of. With amazing breakaway speed, Saquon makes waves in every game in which he plays.
+Baker Mayfield
This Oklahoma QB’s future in the NFL is a little uncertain. But when you see him run around for fifteen seconds only to throw the ball downfield, you will quickly forget about all the whining surrounding his small size and lacking arm strength. You know he will be in the Heisman conversation this season.
+Sam Darnold
This USC QB is the total package. Not only is he a team player, availing his receivers the opening to make plays but he has a way of using his physical prowess to extend plays, utilizing the entire field and countering any argument being made about his interceptions.
Darnold doesn’t look anything like a sophomore when he’s on the field.
+Damien Harris
Everyone that kept crying about this Alabama RB not being on par with 5-star recruits like Josh Jacobs has been forced to eat their words. Harris doesn’t look like he’s anything special until you see the consistent reliability he brings to the table. Harris always performs at his best regardless of the conditions or the challenger.
+Christian Kirk
It isn’t just his stats (19 catches, 250 yards, 4 touchdowns) that make this Texas A&M WR such a catch. Besides speed and agility, Kirk is always willing to go over the muddle.
+Devin Bush
This Michigan LB is following in the footsteps of his father (who was scouted in 1995) by lining up all over the field, making so many plays and proving to his naysayers why he might be better than Maurice Hurst. You won’t find that many sophomores that hit so hard.
+Roquan Smith
This Georgia ILB has been compared to C.J. Mosley and Coach Kirby Smart agrees. Georgia’s defense is pretty loaded and yet Smith has found a way to stand out.
+Hercules Mata’afa
This Washington State DE is versatile. That is his strength. Comparable to the likes of Deone Bucannon and already boasting 4.5 sacks so far in the new season, the athlete has shown an incredible ability to play on his feet and on the edge.
If you’ve been paying close attention to college football, then you know that there’s a lot of talent to marvel at, from Ben Banogu of TCU to Deatrick Nichols of South Florida and Elijah Marks of Northern Arizona.
But the names above tend to stand out for Kiper and McShay.

"U.S. President Donald Trump Quietly Signs Law To Allow Warrantless Searches In Parts Of VA, DC and MD","By Aaron Kesel
As former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said: “You never let a serious crisis go to waste.” While everyone was worried about the hurricanes, U.S. President Donald Trump signed away the Fourth Amendment buried in a new bill. He set a precedent by empowering the police state to allow warrantless searches in parts of VA, MD and D.C. near the Metro train system.
The government can now openly enter and search private property without a warrant in parts of Virginia, Maryland and D.C.
The House Joint Resolution 76 was signed into law on Tuesday, Aug. 22, by President Trump. The text is rather boring, starting off with: “Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.”
CNN explained, “This law lets Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia form a new panel called the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to oversee the safety of the D.C.-area public transportation Metro train system.”
The new safety commission will take over from the current Federal Transit Agency (FTA), which has been in charge of safety oversight for the Washington Metropolitan Area Interstate Compact (WMATA) since October 2015.
“We’ll set this up and get the FTA out of Metro. They are happy to get out, and we’re happy to get them out,” Metro Board of Directors Chair Jack Evans told Bloomberg BNA. “I’m glad we got this thing. If nothing else, we’ll get our money.”
However, buried within the bill’s text is a daunting “one major red flag” that would give the newly formed commission “the authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System ‘without limitation’ and without a warrant, for the purpose of ‘making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing,” The Free Thought Project reported.
The legislation reads:
In performing its duties, the Commission, through its Board or designated employees or agents, may: Enter upon the WMATA Rail System and, upon reasonable notice and a finding by the chief executive officer that a need exists, upon any lands, waters, and premises adjacent to the WMATA Rail System, including, without limitation, property owned or occupied by the federal government, for the purpose of making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing as the Commission may deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this MSC Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass.
Only five Congressman voted against the bill according to U.S. Rep Justin Amash (R-Mich.) while three hundred ninety-nine gave their approval, and 29 didn’t bother to vote at all. Apparently, our elected officials can’t be bothered to stand up for the rights of we the people or the Constitution they swore to protect. After all, the Fourth Amendment doesn’t exist, which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures or anything. As Amash pointed out, the government will now be able to kick in the doors of any private property surrounding the border of the DC Metro Rail System without needing a warrant based on any probable cause.
Only 5 of us voted against bill allowing govt to enter/search private property in parts of VA, MD & DC w/o warrant. https://t.co/SVhTWqbPaB — Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2017 Wire Tapped America - New Free Book (Ad)
A scary prospect indeed, as Rachel Blevins wrote for The Free Thought Project, “While it may only affect the Washington, D.C., metro area now, it could be laying the blueprint for future legislation across the country.”

Could Hunter Renfroe Develop Into Khris Davis v2.0?,"Could Hunter Renfroe Develop Into Khris Davis v2.0?
(Before It's News)
by Eric Stashin (aka The Rotoprofessor)
A year after hitting 34 HR (30 HR at Triple-A, 4 HR in the Majors), the Padres’ Hunter Renfroe made his presence felt combining to hit another 30 HR (26 HR in the Majors). You would think that type of power production would make him a must own option, but a .231 average and time spent back at Triple-A clouds the picture. A strong finish, with 6 HR in September, is going to grab our attention. Now the question is how do we value him going forward?
The issue is his strikeout rate, with a 29.2% mark courtesy of a 15.0% SwStr%. There was no one pitch that he swung and missed at extensively, though he also wasn’t particularly strong against any (Whiff%):
Hard – 14.81%
Breaking – 18.74%
Offspeed – 12.14%
It’s a red flag, especially as the strikeouts surged even during his strong September (34.1% strikeout rate), though it’s not the end of the story. He’s shown a better strikeout rate while at Triple-A, including a 20.4% mark in 533 AB in ’16, so there isn’t concern about the number bloating any further. In fact, given the Whiff% we’d be willing to expect something closer to the 25% range.
That makes a big difference, especially as he’s shown that his power is for real. We’d like to see a better line drive rate (16.7% in ’17), and it appeared like he was swinging for the fences in the second half (55.3% fly ball rate), but as long as he can put up a usable average it’s not a crippling mark. Even at this level, an improvement in strikeouts should lead to a .250ish average (and he could get even better than that).
The big improvement has to come against right-handed pitchers:
RHP – .202/.244/.393
LHP – .316/.392/.664
Considering he hit .291 against RHP at Triple-A in ’16, there’s obviously hope (he thrived in ’17 as well, albeit in a small sample size).
With 14 HR coming at home, he has the potential to be a Khris Davis type player with the potential to hit for even more average. That’s going to make him an intriguing player to target late in your drafts… Assuming he’s locked into the starting lineup on Opening Day. It’s possible he’s viewed as a platoon player, or maybe a bench option, so we’ll have to watch the Padres offseason closely. Keep the name tucked away, though, as an ideal target for the last few rounds.

US soldiers killed in ambush in Niger,"Three US soldiers have been killed and two others wounded in an ambush in Niger near the border with Mali, the US Africa Command has said.
Another soldier from a ""partner nation"" had also died in the attack, it said - without specifying their nationality.
The US soldiers had been providing advice and assistance in Niger's counter-terror operations and come under ""hostile fire"", it said.
Islamist militants, including al-Qaeda fighters, operate in the region.
They are most active in neighbouring Mali, where French troops intervened in 2013 to prevent them from advancing on the capital.
The Boko Haram group, based in Nigeria to the south, has also staged several attacks in Niger.
US President Donald Trump has been briefed by his chief-of-staff, John Kelly, about the attack, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.
Image copyright EPA/US ARMY Image caption These Nigerien soldiers took part in a US training exercise earlier this year
The attack happened 200km (124 miles) north of Niamey, the capital of Niger, the US Africa Command statement said.
The two injured US soldiers had been evacuated to the Landstuhul Regional Medical Centre in Germany and were in a stable condition, it added.
According to the New York Times, those killed were special forces soldiers and were the first Americans to die as a result of hostile fire since the US Africa Command deployed in Niger.
Earlier, an official from Niger's Tillaberi region told Reuters that five Nigerien soldiers were among the dead.
It is not clear who fired on the soldiers.
Militants belonging to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) - an affiliate of al-Qaeda - are active in the region and are known to have conducted cross-border raids.
Scale of jihadist threat
By Tommy Oladipo, BBC Africa security correspondent
This attack will draw attention to the presence of US troops, not just in Niger but in other countries too. In a letter to Congress in June, President Trump confirmed there were 645 military personnel deployed to Niger to support counterterrorism missions there.
The US has long maintained that its troops play a ""train, advise and assist"" role with its partners, whether in the Sahel or the Horn of Africa. Its acknowledgement that the troops in south-west Niger were carrying out a ""joint patrol"" with local forces is being explained as the US providing ""security assistance"" but it is not clear how broadly this assistance is defined.
The attack also highlights the scale of the jihadist threat in Niger, a vast nation with a varied jihadist presence - Boko Haram in Nigeria, militants linked to both al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State in Mali, and uncertainty from unstable Libya in the north.
For as long as the regional jihadist threat remains, the US and other Western powers will continue to strengthen their presence on the ground. Their target, the jihadists, will also be motivated to take them on."
Dave Doeren has finally gotten that signature win,"Dave Doeren has finally gotten that signature win
(Before It's News)
The tenure of Dave Doeren has been an interesting one at NC State. He was brought in to win games, and in his first 4 seasons it was looking rocky. He was not beating teams that he should have (last year ECU, BC are just 2 of those examples). The fan base was becoming very restless in Raleigh. The complaints were many, and wide ranging. There was the dismissal of Offensive Coordinator Matt Canada, there was “he lacked personality,” and then there was the no signature wins. No wins against teams that he had less “talent” than. That all ended on Saturday, with the Wolfpack’s victory against Florida State. Now, people will say, that the reason that NC State won is because FSU lost Deonndre Francois. Others will say it was because of the ref’s and some questionable calls (yes, there were some). Still others will say it was because of the 2 week layoff that the Seminoles had because of Hurricane Irma (this is the only one I’ll give you). Through all of this, Dave Doeren’s team came out and did what it needed to do. The Wolfpack defensive line was dominant, making life hell for FSU’s true freshman quaterback. The offense was balanced rushing the ball 37 times and passing 33 times.
Dave Doeren has been working on all of the things that critics have been throwing at him. If you watched him on The Coaches Room during the National Championship game last season, you saw the personality come out! He was funny and engaging! Dave Doeren needed this game against FSU! He won against a team that will be a top 25 team at the end of the season! Now all he has to do, is not allow this team to rest on this win and continue carrying on that intensity that they took to Doak Campbell Stadium this past Saturday.

Each football weekend, I give you my reaction to handful of ACC games. I very rarely comment on games that I didn’t watch a good a portion of. Let me just say I wasn’t able to watch, but the final minutes of Virginia vs Boise State. I still had to write a game reaction, because frankly the final score is kind of stunning.
Virginia 43 Boise State 23 in Boise, Idaho.
Good for Virginia, Good for their fans, and Good for head coach Bronco Mendenhall. I didn’t have to watch this game to tell you how significant a victory this was for the long suffering program and fanbase.
Boise State 2017 might not be a vintage version, but they took a really good Washington State team to 3 OTs. In fact they should have won. The Broncos led the game 31-10 in the 4th qtr. Playing at Boise State is never easy, and what Virginia did is eye opening.
At 3-1, following a 2-10 season, the Hoos can start thinking bigger. No Clemson isn’t looking over their shoulder, and the Hoos aren’t winning the Coastal, but a bowl game is now a realistic goal. With Duke, at UNC, Boston College, at Pitt, and Georgia Tech in their next 5 games, there isn’t one of those Virginia shouldn’t expect to compete in.
Something surrounds the Virginia program after this big win that we haven’t seen in years. That something is called hope.

Iran still trying to buy items for missile development: Germany,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German intelligence agencies have warned German companies that Iran is still trying to circumvent restrictions on the sale of dual-use items for its rocket and missile technology program, according to a document seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
The BfV domestic intelligence agency reminded German firms in the document that sales of certain technologies remained illegal despite sanctions relief triggered by the landmark Iran nuclear deal of 2015.
“It is important to note that Iran continues to pursue an ambitious rocket and missile technology program which is not affected by the sanctions relief,” the document said.
It said the reminder was triggered by “current events” but gave no details.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel on Monday told reporters that Berlin remains concerned about Iran’s behavior in the Middle East and its missile development program, but stressed that Tehran was sticking to the nuclear agreement.
European countries are scrambling to pull together a package of measures to keep the nuclear deal on track if U.S. President Donald Trump decertifies the nuclear pact. Under that pact, Iran agreed to freeze its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for sanctions relief.
Trump is expected to declare this week that Iran is not complying with the pact and to unveil a tough new strategy toward Iran.
CIRCUMVENTING REGULATIONS
The BfV document said German intelligence agencies were continuing to investigate “intensively” whether Iran was attempting to circumvent existing regulations to acquire products or know-how in Germany.
It had reported in June that Iran had sharply scaled back efforts to buy items for its nuclear program, but said attempts to buy items for its development program remained unchanged. It gave no details about the number of such attempts.
Germany’s most populous state and its industrial heartland, North Rhine-Westphalia, provided details in its own intelligence report for 2016 that was released on Tuesday.
It said it had detected 32 attempts to buy equipment that were probably or definitely proliferation-related in 2016, down from a record 141 attempts seen a year earlier. Most of those attempts were related to Iran’s missile program, although some were also linked to Pakistan, it said.
The lion’s share of the cases did not result in delivery of any equipment because state intelligence officials were able to warn companies in time, or companies recognized suspicious inquiries.
It said Iran used a variety of front companies to acquire items, often sending goods through Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and China."
"Turkey urges U.S. to review visa suspension as lira, stocks tumble","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey urged the United States on Monday to review its suspension of visa services after the arrest of a U.S. consulate employee sharply escalated tension between the two NATO allies and drove Turkey’s currency and stocks lower.
Relations between Ankara and Washington have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey’s calls for the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a U.S. court.
But last week’s arrest of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016. Gulen denies any connection with the coup.
The U.S. embassy in Ankara condemned Ankara’s charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of its missions and staff.
Within hours, Ankara announced it was taking the same measures against U.S. citizens seeking visas for Turkey.
The U.S. ambassador said the duration of the visa services’ suspension would depend on talks between the two governments about the reasons for the detention of local staff in Turkey.
In a written statement late on Monday, Ambassador John Bass said the length of the suspension would also depend on “the Turkish government’s commitment to protecting our facilities and personnel here in Turkey”.
He noted that the move was not a visa ban on Turkish citizens, that valid visas could still be used and visa applications could be made outside of Turkey.
The U.S. Embassy had been unable to learn the reasons for the arrest of its Turkish staff member last week or what evidence exists against the employee, Bass said, adding that he had not been allowed sufficient access to the employee’s lawyer.
Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them.
“But if it’s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,” Gul told A Haber television. “Trying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.”
The Turkish foreign ministry summoned a U.S. diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa services suspension, saying it was causing “unnecessary tensions”, and President Tayyip Erdogan also criticized the U.S. move.
“For the (U.S.) embassy in Ankara to take such a decision and implement it, it is upsetting,” Erdogan told a news conference during a visit to Ukraine.

State-run Anadolu news agency said another U.S. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughter’s suspected links to Gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of Metin Topuz, the employee arrested last week.
INVESTORS RATTLED
The diplomatic spat spooked investors. The lira dropped 3.4 percent and stood at 3.7385 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223.
The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points.
Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent.

The central bank said it was following developments closely.
“This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash. He added that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something Erdogan has resisted.
Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly.
The row with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited.
U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.
Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed.
Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan on charges of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fall-out particularly bitter.
“This harshness is a result of a build-up,” he said. “We should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees”."
"The ‘Resistance,’ Raising Big Money, Upends Liberal Politics","Mr. James’s committee is among more than three dozen outfits that have started or reconfigured themselves since the election to try to harness the surge in anti-Trump activism. In addition to political committees, grass-roots mobilization nonprofits and legal watchdog groups, there are for-profit companies providing technological help to the new groups — essentially forming a new liberal ecosystem outside the confines of the Democratic Party.
While the new groups gained early traction mostly on the strength of grass-roots volunteers and small donations — and with relatively meager overall budgets — they are beginning to attract attention from the left’s most generous benefactors.
“We’re in a disruptive period, and when we get through it, the progressive infrastructure landscape may look different,” said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups. “There may be groups that have been around that don’t rise to the challenge, and there may be some new groups that do rise to the challenge, while others fade away.”
The Democracy Alliance has helped shape the institutional left, steering more than $600 million since its inception in 2005 to a portfolio of carefully selected groups, including pillars of the Clinton-aligned establishment like the think tank Center for American Progress and the media watchdog Media Matters.
But this year, the Democracy Alliance hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama White House official, to help the new anti-Trump groups, and it suspended its intensive vetting and approval process to recommend donations to a host of groups created since last fall’s election.
The Democracy Alliance distributed a “resistance map” to its donors in July including new groups focused on converting the anti-Trump energy into electoral wins, such as Flippable, Swing Left and Sister District, as well as legal watchdog groups and others focused on mobilizing protesters, such as Women’s March and Indivisible.
Perhaps no group epitomizes the differences between the legacy left and the grass-roots resistance like Indivisible. Started as a Google document detailing techniques for opposing the Republican agenda under Mr. Trump, the group now has a mostly Washington-based staff of about 40 people, with more than 6,000 volunteer chapters across the country. The national Indivisible hub, which consists of a pair of nonprofit groups, has raised nearly $6 million since its start, primarily through small-dollar donations made through its website.

Yet Indivisible has also received funding from the tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, as well as foundations or coalitions tied to Democracy Alliance donors, including the San Francisco mortgage billionaire Herbert Sandler, the New York real estate heiress Patricia Bauman and the oil heiress Leah Hunt-Hendrix.
And an advocacy group funded by the billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros, a founding member of the Democracy Alliance and one of the most influential donors on the left, is considering a donation in the low six figures to Indivisible. Mr. Soros has already donated to a host of nonprofit groups playing key roles in the anti-Trump movement, including the Center for Community Change, Color of Change and Local Progress.
Indivisible would “gladly” accept a check from Mr. Soros or his foundation, said an official with the group, Sarah Dohl. But, she added, the group is committed to ensuring that money from major donors does not become a majority of the group’s revenue “because we want to maintain our independence both from the funders and from the party.”
The group may start a political committee that could support primary challenges in 2018 against Democratic incumbents, Ms. Dohl said.
“It’s not a secret that we would like to move the Democratic Party further left,” she said, adding that “the party will only get to where it needs to go if it has groups like ours pushing them to do the right thing.” She cited her group’s aggressive opposition to Republicans’ initial efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act at a time when she said Democratic congressional leaders “didn’t really have a strategy.”
Established liberal groups like the Center for American Progress haven’t always been as forceful, Ms. Dohl said, though she added that the think tank “has gotten better at calling on Democrats to stand up and speak more boldly than they have in the past.”
The think tank, known as CAP, has engendered resentment from others on the left for casting itself as a leader of the anti-Trump movement and raising money off the resistance nomenclature. Within a few weeks of the election, CAP’s sister organization, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, was offering T-shirts emblazoned with the word “Resist” in exchange for donations of $40 or more. The campaign raised about $450,000 for ThinkProgress, the journalism arm of the action fund, which had its lawyers look into trademarking the iconography.

Daniella Leger, a CAP official, explained in a statement that the group’s legal team was merely exploring “a standard question” about whether to trademark the logo. “The immediate response was no — resistance belongs to everyone,” she said.
But the embrace by CAP has some anti-Trump activists complaining privately that the group is anathema to the anti-establishment fervor animating the resistance, and it is siphoning away resources from the new groups.

The divisions have sometimes spilled into public view.
The leader of a group founded by Mr. Sanders called Our Revolution castigated the Democratic establishment as arrogant “dictators” who want to control the “terms of unity” after her group’s activists were met by barricades outside the Washington headquarters of the Democratic National Committee when they visited in July to deliver petitions supporting a liberal policy platform.
And Ms. Hunt-Hendrix has urged progressive donors to boycott Democratic establishment-aligned groups like the centrist think tank Third Way and the nonprofits spearheaded by David Brock, the former conservative journalist who became a leading Clinton supporter and founded Media Matters and the opposition research outfit American Bridge.
Those groups represent a “neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party” that embraces “broken tactics” and an “uninspiring” agenda “more focused on defeating the right than on creating an economy and society that lifts up all people,” Ms. Hunt-Hendrix wrote in an op-ed article this year for Politico.
Matt Bennett, an official at Third Way, challenged predictions that the new wave of resistance activism would substantially shift the axis of the party. “The idea that all the energy in the Democratic Party is on the far left is premature, and is going to turn out to be the worst prediction of the 2020 cycle,” he said.
Mr. Brock and Ms. Leger both said that their groups have been providing research, polling, training and other resources to the new groups, which they cast as a boon to the left, rather than a threat to more established groups.
“The resistance is strongest when everyone has access to our resources,” Mr. Brock said. Ms. Leger said, “These grass-roots groups play a different, unique role, and their energy is something the progressive movement hadn’t seen in decades.” And a D.N.C. spokeswoman, Xochitl Hinojosa, praised the new groups for their work to “bring about progressive change and elect Democrats.”
Yet one major Democratic donor, the Virginia real estate developer Albert J. Dwoskin, said the fluidity in the universe of liberal groups would cause some donors to sit on the sidelines “to wait to see which ones have any legs whatsoever.” And veteran Democratic operatives are concerned that the proliferation could further fracture the left, widening ideological divisions and leaving groups fighting for resources.
That doesn’t bother Dmitri Mehlhorn, a political adviser to Mr. Hoffman, the billionaire founder of LinkedIn, who has brought a venture capital approach to politics, seeding a wide array of new groups on the left.

“The Democratic Party has been fractured,” Mr. Mehlhorn said. “We believe that by investing in different people and groups to try different techniques that good ideas will emerge.”
Among Mr. Hoffman’s donations are at least $1 million each to two of the groups suing Mr. Trump’s campaign, his administration, businesses and associates — United to Protect Democracy, started this year by a former Obama White House lawyer, and Integrity First for America, which will be unveiled later this year by the pioneering New York trial lawyer Roberta A. Kaplan.
A Silicon Valley-like competition between start-ups might not be the best thing for the left right now, warned Rob Stein, a longtime Democratic strategist who helped create the Democracy Alliance to provide structure to the institutional left.
“Having a thousand flowers blooming at the beginning of a new era is generally a good thing,” Mr. Stein said. “But when you’ve got your back against the wall, too many new blooms can cause message and operational cacophony.”
He warned that the combination of ideological and structural divisions, along with a national party weakened by changes in campaign finance laws, could “make it very, very difficult for progressives and Democrats to drive a coherent message in 2018, and to align behind a single candidate in 2020.”"
North Korea preparing long-range missile test: RIA cites Russian lawmaker,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - North Korea is preparing to test a long-range missile which it believes can reach the west coast of the United States, a Russian lawmaker just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday.
Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee, and two other Russian lawmakers visited Pyongyang on Oct. 2-6, Russia’s RIA news agency reported.
“They are preparing for new tests of a long-range missile. They even gave us mathematical calculations that they believe prove that their missile can hit the west coast of the United States,” RIA quoted Morozov as saying.
“As far as we understand, they intend to launch one more long-range missile in the near future. And in general, their mood is rather belligerent.”
Tensions have risen in recent weeks over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs as Pyongyang has test-fired several missiles and conducted what it said was a test explosion of a hydrogen bomb as it advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
Morozov’s comments drove up the price of U.S. Treasury bonds, as investors, worried about the prospect of new North Korean missile tests, moved into assets the market views as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.
Reuters was not able to independently verify Morozov’s account, and he did not specify which North Korean officials had given him the information about the planned test.
In Washington, a U.S. official said that there had been indications that North Korea could be preparing for a missile test on or around Oct. 10, the anniversary of the founding of the ruling Korean Workers Party and a day after the Columbus Day holiday in the United States.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not disclose the type of missile that could be tested and cautioned that North Korea in the past has not staged launches despite indications that it would.

A senior CIA analyst, speaking at a conference in Washington this week, said the North Korean government likely would stage some kind of provocation on Oct. 10 but did not elaborate on what form it might take.
“There is a clarity of purpose in what (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un is doing. I don’t think he’s done,“ said Yong Suk Lee, the deputy assistant director of the CIA’s Korea Mission Center, which was set up this year. ”In fact, I told my own staff (that) October 10th is the Korean Workers Party founding day. That’s Tuesday in North Korea, but Monday – the Columbus Day holiday - in the United States. So stand by your phones.”
Morozov’s delegation had “high-level” meetings in Pyongyang, RIA news agency said, citing the Russian embassy in the North Korean capital.
Tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program have been running high in recent weeks since Pyongyang staged a series of missile tests, and conducted a text explosion on Sept. 3 of what it said was a hydrogen bomb.

There has also been an exchange of tough rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington.
U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un responded by calling Trump deranged and saying he would pay dearly for his threat.
China, North Korea’s main ally, has backed sanctions against Pyongyang and on Saturday in response to the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said it backed a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons.
“China has always supported a complete and total ban on nuclear weapons, but also believes that the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament cannot be achieved overnight and must advance gradually within the existing disarmament mechanism. China is willing to work with all parties to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world,” said China’s foreign ministry.
“BELLICOSE RHETORIC”
Morozov is a member of the LDPR, a right-wing populist party. It casts itself as an opposition party, but hews close to the Kremlin line on matters of international affairs.
Describing meetings with North Korean officials, Morozov said they “displayed serious determination and bellicose rhetoric,” RIA reported.
“The situation, of course, demands the swiftest intervention of all interested states, particularly those represented in the region, in order to prevent wide-scale military action,” the agency quoted him as saying.
Russia has closer relations with Pyongyang than many other world powers, linked in part to Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and the current leader’s grand-father, having lived for a time in the Soviet Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has joined other world powers in condemning North Korea’s weapons program, but has taken a softer line than Western governments.
Putin has said that Pyongyang will not be cowed into giving up its weapons program. He has accused Washington of trying to effect regime change in North Korea, and predicted that would unleash chaos.
U.S. Treasury prices surged on the report of a possible new missile test, pulling yields lower, as investors cut risk out of their portfolios and sought the safety of Treasuries. Treasury prices move inversely to their yields.
Benchmark 10 year U.S. Treasury yields fell from the session high 2.40 percent mark US10YT=TWEB to 2.35 percent around midday (1600 GMT) in New York.
“It has just been risk-off buying into the long (Columbus Day) weekend ... You look at the charts, it has really been a one-way trade of lower yields,” said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.

Catalonia: Spain celebrates National Day amid political turmoil,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Spain staged a big patriotic show for its national day
Spain's royal family has attended a National Day military parade amid a political crisis sparked by Catalonia's disputed independence referendum.
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told MPs on Wednesday that democratic Spain was facing its most serious threat for 40 years. Madrid may impose direct rule.
Mr Rajoy has given the Catalan leader five days to clarify whether or not he has declared independence.
Human Rights Watch says Spanish police used excessive force in Catalonia.
The US-based international rights group says it documented ""excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrators"" in Girona and two villages in Catalonia during the 1 October independence referendum.
It said the Spanish government must conduct an ""effective investigation"" into the incidents, which occurred during a vote that Spain's Constitutional Court had declared illegal.
There was shock and outrage in Catalonia and elsewhere at the violence of Spanish Civil Guards and national police.
The National Day is a public holiday and commemorates the Christian reconquest of Spain and Christopher Columbus's first arrival in the Americas in 1492.
Several thousand supporters of Spanish unity, including members of a far-right nationalist group, rallied in Barcelona, waving Spanish and Catalan flags.
A large military parade took place in Madrid and other events are being held across the country.

Catalan officials say almost 90% of voters backed independence on 1 October, with a turnout of 43%. Anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were reports of irregularities.
Catalonia, one of Spain's wealthiest regions, has seen several major companies announce plans to move their head offices elsewhere because of the crisis.
Following days of intense speculation, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence in Barcelona on Tuesday, but immediately suspended its implementation to allow for talks with Madrid.
The move frustrated hardline separatists and brought scorn from the Spanish government.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Rajoy accused the Catalan leader of creating confusion
After holding an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr Rajoy accused Mr Puigdemont of having created ""deliberate confusion"" and said he wanted to restore ""certainty"".
He said his government had asked the regional government to clarify whether or not it had declared independence.
If Mr Puigdemont confirms by Monday that he has, he will be given a further three days to withdraw the declaration.
Failing that, Madrid will invoke Article 155 of the constitution allowing it to suspend the region's autonomy and impose direct rule. Article 155 has never been used before.
'Restore normality'
""There is an urgent need to put an end to the situation that Catalonia is going through - to return it to safety, tranquillity and calm and to do that as quickly as possible,"" Mr Rajoy said.
He accused separatists of hatching an ""anti-democratic plan foisting their will on all the people of Catalonia"", and said the Spanish government had had no choice but to restore order.
Addressing parliament later, Mr Rajoy said Spanish democracy was ""experiencing one of the most serious moments in its history"".
""It falls to the Catalan leader to restore constitutional normality,"" he added, rejecting any suggestion of outside mediation.
He said he was willing to negotiate on the issue of regional autonomy and changes to the constitution, but this had to be within the framework of the law."
Woman sets husband on fire for molesting her 7-year-old daughter,"A woman is in custody after setting her husband on fire for allegedly molesting her 7-year-old daughter.
 
According to police, Tatanysha Hedman, 40, poured gasoline on her husband Vincent Phillips, 52, as he slept. At that point, she allegedly set him on fire.
 
Phillips ran from the couples apartment and entered a convenience store screaming, “I’m on fire!”
 
Investigators say Hedman set him on fire because he hurt her daughter, which is his stepchild. She told police that shooting him “was too nice.”
 
Phillips has been charged with first degree child molestation. He is in intensive care.
 
Hedman was sent to jail on assault and arson charges.
 
A gofundme account has been set up to help with Tatanysha’s legal fees.

"Saturday: Two To Go - Jamo v Max Scherzer, Lineup, Notes","Saturday: Two To Go – Jamo v Max Scherzer, Lineup, Notes
(Before It's News)
Tonight: The countdown reaches two with the first pitch at 7:05. The game will be aired on AT&T SportsNet and 93.7 The Fan.
Lineup: Adam Frazier 2B, Starling Marte LF, Cutch CF, Josh Bell 1B, Gregory Polanco RF, Sean Rodriguez 3B, Elias Diaz C, Max Moroff SS & Jamo P. Looks like Jordy is getting the series off; maybe Stew too.
Been a long year for JT (photo Pittsburgh Pirates)
Pitchers: Jameson Taillon (8-7, 4.62) finishes his campaign against Max Scherzer (16-6, 2.55). Jamo will be making his 25th start tonight, and had a good outing last time he toed the slab with a 4-1 win over the Cardinals, though we’re still not sure what purpose is being served by trotting him out. He faced the Nats once last year and has no record against them. Scherzer is again on the short list of Cy Young candidates (six hits per nine with 12 K) and is going up against a team that has been swinging their bats like they’re made of lead. It will be his first outing of the year v the Pirates, with a 4-2/2.89 lifetime slash in nine starts.
Notes:
Starling Marte ran his hitting streak to 10 games with a 2-for-4 performance last night. He’s hitting .472 (17-for-36) during the streak with seven multi-hit games. Cutch has a six-gamer going on.
The Bucs have gone 29-50 on the road this season, having lost seven in a row and 13 of their last 14.
Big day in Bucco history: Roberto got hit #3,000 on this date in 1972 and Ralph Kiner hit his franchise-record 54th homer in 1949.
Max Scherzer, btw, has whiffed 250+ batters for four consecutive seasons (2014-17). He’s the fourth hurler in MLB history to do that, joining Hall-of-Famers Randy Johnson (1997-2002), Ferguson Jenkins (1968-71) and Pedro Martinez (1997-2000).

Why Arpaio pardon still rankles,"Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. This commentary has been updated from an earlier version to reflect news from a Wednesday hearing.
(CNN) On Wednesday in Phoenix, US District Judge Susan Bolton heard arguments relating to President Donald Trump's pardon of Joe Arpaio. Trump pardoned the former Maricopa County sheriff on August 25 , and the Department of Justice has dropped its case against him. The hearing was to decide whether Arpaio's conviction stands or is vacated -- thus closing an infamous chapter in Arizona history.
Right?
Not so fast. While Judge Bolton accepted Trump's pardon of Arpaio as legitimate, she did not rule on his request to have his record expunged. Nor should she expunge Arpaio's record.
There were genuine concerns regarding the legitimacy of Arpaio's pardon in the first place.
In 2016, Arpaio was found to be in civil contempt for refusing to obey a 2011 court order that he stop detaining people without the reasonable suspicion of a crime. In July, Bolton found him to be in criminal contempt for continuing these practices. Then came Trump's pardon, which many have viewed as motivated by politics and a simpatico worldview with the ex-sheriff, and now Arpaio wants his record wiped clean.
You don't have to be a lawyer to recognize that something about this process seems wrong; most Americans were against Trump pardoning Arpaio . The President pardoned Arpaio before he was sentenced, which was an unprecedented move. More broadly, this pardon can be read as the President endorsing racial profiling. And because it could allow Arpaio to escape any punishment for flouting the law, it also undermines the independence of the judiciary.
It could also result in more racial profiling of Latinos, if law enforcement officials believe there will be no consequence for such impermissible actions. The US Commission on Civil Rights has denounced it , while the American Bar Association noted that the pardon ""sends the wrong message to the public.""
Moreover, there was a legal case to be made that Arpaio's pardon should not stand. The presidential pardon power comes from Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which states that ""the President ... shall have power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States."" But as Harvard law professor Laurence H. Tribe has pointed out, this does not mean unlimited power. Implicit in the pardon power is the principle that it shall not conflict with other parts of the Constitution.
Trump's pardon of Arpaio was suspect because it appears to violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Consider that for judicial review and due process to function, courts must be able to serve as a check on government officials. That would not be the case if Arpaio's pardon were allowed to stand, because Arpaio defied judges' orders.
And what about the Latinos whose civil rights were trampled on by Arpaio's immigration ""sweeps"" in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods? This pardon deprives them of a lawful remedy for a violation of their rights, which means they would not receive equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.
Arpaio's pardon could have future implications, too. Harvard professor Tribe notes that the 1962 desegregation of the University of Mississippi depended on court orders for enforcement. Chipping away at such authority could have consequences in the future -- possibly setting the stage for Trump to pardon a close associate or family member in the event one is implicated in the probe of alleged campaign collusion with Russia.
in everyone's interest for Bolton to Surely there are liberals and conservatives who disagree on these legal arguments. That's why it wasin everyone's interest for Bolton to appoint a special prosecutor to argue against vacating Arpaio's conviction.
As things stand now, the judge will only be hearing from Arpaio's attorneys on why his conviction should be vacated. However, the constitutional questions raised by Arpaio's pardon deserve a full adversarial hearing. In fact, in cases such as this, where the government has declined to press forward with its case, federal rules say that ""the court must appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt.""
There's another reason why a special prosecutor was necessary for an effective disposition of this case. Only a special prosecutor representing the United States could challenge the judge's decision on the pardon, which would allow the matter to go to the Court of Appeals or perhaps the Supreme Court for a final ruling.
Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook
No matter where you stand on Arpaio's pardon, wouldn't you prefer that the matter be truly resolved? That can't happen absent a special prosecutor, which is why 33 congressional representatives have written to Bolton asking her to appoint one.
True, presidential pardons are often controversial. Remember Bill Clinton's pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich , or George H.W. Bush's pardon of six figures in the Iran-Contra scandal ? Yet their offenses did not involve directly violating the constitutional rights of others. Nor were their pardons for crimes that originated within the judiciary. Arpaio's case represents uncharted territory and thus merits comprehensive legal scrutiny.
Although Judge Bolton declined to appoint a prosecutor to argue against Arpaio's pardon, his case should not be expunged from the record. That would have the legal effect of saying that the whole case against him had never occurred.
Department of Justice guidelines on presidential pardons specifically state that a pardon does not erase or expunge the crime for which the pardon was granted; even the President cannot erase someone's record this way. ""Please be aware that if you were to be granted a presidential pardon, the pardoned offense would not be removed from your record,"" the DOJ website notes.
Going forward, the least that Judge Bolton can do is ensure that Arpaio's actions and conviction remain on the record, to remind us of how one person was able to violate his oath of office and abuse his lawful authority. To hold otherwise would be disrespectful to the judiciary -- as well as the Latinos whose civil rights were violated."
Harvey Weinstein: Oscars academy to hold emergency talks,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dozens of films produced by Harvey Weinstein have won Academy Awards
The hosts of the Oscars are to hold emergency talks to consider the future role of film mogul Harvey Weinstein following claims of sexual misconduct.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said the allegations of sexual assault against Weinstein were ""repugnant"".
Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, has already suspended his membership.
Weinstein strongly denies the allegations against him.
In another development, police in New York told the BBC they were looking to speak to an individual regarding an allegation against Weinstein dating from 2004. The NYPD did not provide further details.
The US academy, which has handed out 81 Oscars to films produced by Weinstein's Miramax studio and the Weinstein Company, said it would meet on Saturday to ""discuss the allegations against Weinstein and any actions warranted by the academy"".

A statement has also been issued by Cannes Film Festival, which Weinstein has attended many times.
President Pierre Lescure said they have been ""dismayed to learn of the accusations"".
""These actions point to a pattern of behaviour that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnation.
""Our thoughts go out to the victims, to those who have had the courage to testify and to all the others. May this case help us once again to denounce all such serious and unacceptable practices.""

Meanwhile, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told CNN she felt ""sick"" about the allegations surrounding Weinstein, pledging to donate money he had raised for her campaigns to charity.
Weinstein reportedly raised more than $1.4m (£1.05m) for Democratic groups, and Republicans have accused Democrats of not doing enough to distance themselves from him.
'Powerless and scared'
A string of high-profile actresses, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have come forward to accuse the movie producer of sexual harassment or assault.
British actress and model Cara Delevingne is one of the latest to accuse him of inappropriate behaviour. In a statement, she said he tried to kiss her as she tried to leave a hotel room.
""I felt very powerless and scared,"" she said.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lea Seydoux starred in the Bond film Spectre
The French actress Léa Seydoux has written an article detailing her experience with Weinstein who she met at a fashion show.
She wrote in The Guardian about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink.
""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted.
""I wasn't afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.""
On Tuesday, Weinstein denied allegations of rape made in The New Yorker magazine. On the same day, his wife Georgina Chapman said she was leaving him.
Oscar-nominated actress Annette Bening said Weinstein was well known in Hollywood for being ""boorish"", but that she had not known the extent of his alleged behaviour.
""I certainly didn't know that this was going on to the degree that it was,"" she told BBC News. ""It's terrible. And it's great that these women have come forward. I really respect them. Maybe it's a tipping point. Maybe culturally this means that things will change.""

On Wednesday, US prosecutors defended their decision not to take action against Weinstein after a woman complained about his behaviour in 2015.
The Manhattan district attorney's office said undercover audio of the complainant and Weinstein was ""insufficient to prove a crime"".
Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, 22, had gone to police to accuse Weinstein of touching her inappropriately. She then agreed to meet the producer again while wearing a hidden microphone.
The district attorney's office said police arranged the meeting without informing them.
""Prosecutors were not afforded the opportunity before the meeting to counsel investigators on what was necessary to capture in order to prove a misdemeanour sex crime,"" they said.

They said the ""horrifying"" audio ""was insufficient to prove a crime under New York law"" which left prosecutors with ""no choice but to conclude the criminal investigation without charges"".
In the recording, Weinstein can be heard asking Ms Gutierrez to come into his hotel room. The model asks the producer ""why yesterday you touched my breast?"" He apologises, saying he ""won't do it again"".
Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister said: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein. Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.
""Mr Weinstein obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.
""Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.""
On Wednesday she declined to comment on reports that Weinstein was intending to travel to Europe to enter a rehabilitation facility.

Jets vs. Jaguars Week 4 Preview,"Jets vs. Jaguars Week 4 Preview
(Before It's News)
Coming off of what may have been the best performance Todd Bowles has gotten out of his team since taking over in a 20-6 win over the Miami Dolphins, the Jets host the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Jets may have a hard time dominating on defense the way they did against Jay Cutler and the Dolphins. Last week saw the Jaguars throttle the Baltimore Ravens 44-7 as quarterback Blake Bortles threw 4 touchdown passes in a game that he was forced to exit early.
Who: NY Jets (1-2) vs Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1)
When: Sunday at 1 pm
Where: Metlife Stadium
Point Spread: Jets +3
Here’s a look at which players and position groups will be key for the Jets this Sunday at home.
ILB Darron Lee vs. TE Mercedes Lewis:
Lewis is coming off of a 3 touchdown performance against the Baltimore Ravens and the Ravens have to know that Darron Lee has been vulnerable in coverage. Blake Bortles could view the match-up as an opportunity to stay with the hat hand in Lewis and look his way when the Ravens are in the red zone.
Jets D-line vs. RB Leonard Fournette:
Fournette is only averaging around 3.5 yards per carry, but the battering ram running back will test the Jets defensive line (and linebackers) early on. If they don’t find a way to keep him in check, the Jaguars will likely give the Jets a big dose of the heavy hitter. If the Jets defense gets gassed early, the Jags could also turn to former Jets RB Chris Ivory whose fresh legs and physical style could set him up for a big day as well.
Leonard Williams is still in search of his first sack of the season.
DL Leonard Williams vs. LT Cam Robinson:
The Jets like to move their defensive linemen around in multiple looks, and Williams, while nursing a sore wrist, is still looking for his first sack of the season. Robinson, a rookie out of Alabama, should give Williams, now in his third year, an opportunity to make some impact plays on defense.
WR Robby Anderson vs. CB AJ Bouye:
Bouye has been a big reason for Jacksonville’s improved defense and Robby Anderson was a key factor in the Jets offense getting going last week against the Dolphins. Anderson’s 69-yard touchdown pass was the team’s offensive highlight of the day. Look for quarterback Josh McCown to take a couple of deep shots down the field to Anderson, who has had success in beating some of the leagues best cornerbacks since last season.
RB’s Bilal Powell and Elijah McGuire vs MLB Paul Posluszny:
Matt Forte is on the shelf for this one with a bout of turf toe, so Jets fans will get their wish and see a heavy dose of Bilal Powell and rookie running back Elijah McGuire. Both Powell and McGuire do an excellent job of finding a hole if it’s there and finding their way through it. When they do, it will be Posluszny’s job to limit the damage at the second level.
RT Ben Ijalana/Brent Qvale vs. OLB Dante Fowler
Brandon Shell has been listed as doubtful in this one and that will likely mean Ijalana or Qvale will take his place. If so, Fowler will likely be moved around a fair bit and get his chance to make some plays against a pair of tackles who are adequate at best. Josh McCown has been solid for Gang Green in the early going, and Jacksonville would like nothing more than to disrupt his timing with some heavy blitz packages.
The Jets will be hoping for a better turnout than they saw last week, but in all reality it’s going to take more than a win or two to convince the fan base that this team is worth making the trek for and Sunday’s game probably won’t help.
Prediction:
Jaguars 27 Jets 17

Emotional Night in Las Vegas Ends With a Golden Knights Win,"“It was probably one of the more emotional moments of my life,” Engelland said. “I probably don’t plan on scoring in too many games, but to get that one was pretty special.”
Marc-Andre Fleury made 31 saves for the Golden Knights, who became the first team in N.H.L. history to begin their debut season with three straight wins.
Just nine days after the massacre occurred less than a mile from T-Mobile Arena, the Golden Knights reverently honored the victims and heroes before the long-awaited home debut of the city’s first major professional sports franchise.
The Knights held a pre-game ceremony during which the names of the shooting victims were projected in gold onto the ice during 58 seconds of silence. Engelland spoke eloquently to the fans, vowing that the Golden Knights “will do everything we can to help you and our city heal. We are Vegas Strong.”
After that emotional outpouring, the Golden Knights charged into their home opener with some inspired hockey.

“We talked about tonight being the most important game we’ll ever play,” Vegas coach Gerard Gallant said. “A lot of guys, we’re playing for our city. We’re playing for the tragedy that happened, for all the people that were here tonight and affected by the tragedy. I thought our guys did a hell of a job. They came out and they focused on the game. They focused from the start.”
Nosek and Engelland connected in the opening minutes before Neal scored back-to-back goals in 4:27, giving him five goals in three games — and all three game-winning goals in team history. Vegas led 4-0 in less than 11 minutes, well on its way to a cathartic victory.
Oscar Lindberg scored in the second period for the Golden Knights, who opened their inaugural season with back-to-back road victories before returning home.

Tobias Rieder and Kevin Connauton scored for the Coyotes, who remained winless after losing back-to-back games to the expansion Golden Knights in a four-day stretch.
“That’s the one thing that disappointed me, that the effort by five or six guys at some points in the game wasn’t there,” Coyotes coach Rick Tocchet said. “Vegas deserved to win the game. It was a great program before the game. The organization did a nice job.”
The Golden Knights’ home opener was a bit more somber than the franchise originally planned, although the crowd was still whipped into a frenzy by the team’s excellent play. T-Mobile Arena had no ads on the boards around the ice for the opener. Instead, the all-white boards simply displayed the same message: “Vegas Strong.”
The crowd had scarcely quieted from the pregame festivities when Nosek, the Czech wing who spent the past two seasons with Detroit, fired a shot through Antti Raanta for a surprising goal.
Engelland, the veteran defenseman who has lived in Las Vegas since playing here for a minor league team several years ago, then took a pass from Brendan Leipsic and fired it through traffic.
Neal, who scored the first goal in franchise history, made it 3-0 just 6:15 into the first period and chased Raanta, who stopped only three shots. Neal added the first power-play goal in franchise history 4:27 later, setting off roars of excitement in T-Mobile Arena."
2 gay Iraqi soldiers found love amid war -- then fled to the US,"Seattle Each night, when the guns fell silent in Iraq, Btoo Allami would invite his friend Nayyef Hrebid over for dinner.
The two first locked eyes on a dusty battlefield in Ramadi. After days of exchanging hasty glances amid gunfire, they snuck away one night to listen to Michael Jackson on shared earbuds.
The music stopped, but a love story was just beginning.
A decade ago, Allami was a sergeant in the Iraqi military when he met Hrebid, then a translator for the US Marines.
Militants had seized a hospital in Ramadi, and they were part of a mission to reclaim it.
When not defusing bombs, they'd talk late into the night at a pitch black lot surrounded by Humvees. Allami fell in love, unafraid of the war, yet terrified by what was happening with Hrebid.
Nayyef Hrebid and Btoo Allami at their home in Seattle on August 13, 2017.
Their love story would take them through two continents as they joined the 22 million refugees in the world, all fleeing war, grinding poverty and in their case, persecution from militants and relatives . Last year, only 14,700 Iraqi refugees were resettled worldwide, says Andrej Mahecic, a spokesman for the UN refugee agency. The UN does not have the number of applicants who claim asylum based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Few countries, if any, collect such statistics, he says.
Taking chances
LGBT people in Iraq risk harassment, beatings, and brutal killings -- sometimes by family members. ISIS, which held large swaths of Iraqi territory until recently, has also targeted gay men , tossing many to their deaths from tall buildings.
Despite the risks, Allami took a chance two weeks after they met. ""I love you,"" he told Hrebid.
Hrebid did not say a word, but drew him close and kissed him.
Allami was so excited, he didn't eat for two days. At the time, he didn't know that Hrebid loved his calm demeanor and the way his dark hair shone in the sunlight.
Their relationship grew, but in secret. They knew loving each other openly could be deadly. Even during the days of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, when the US did not officially allow gay people to serve in the military, Hrebid says a base officer allowed them to spend time together at the American base.
Their talks put them in a bubble. During those moments, war and bloodshed did not exist.
One last night
Hrebid loved his job as a translator.
At the base, his American buddies called him David to protect his identity. But word got out that he was gay, and that he was a US translator. His name was added to a militant hit list posted on the streets of Ramadi.
When the two men were separated by continents, Hrebid would draw sketches of him and Allami.
People started talking. It was time to leave.
In March 2009, Hrebid applied for asylum as part of a program that gives preference to Iraqis and Afghans who translated for the US government overseas. Hrebid's application was approved eight months later.
The night he got his US visa, they sat up all night in a candlelit room, hugging each other and crying.
As much as it crushed him, Hrebid flew to Seattle in December 2009, leaving Allami behind.
But they kept their promise to stay in touch. One night, as they chatted on Skype, Allami's relatives overheard them and realized he was gay.
Some of his relatives accused him of bringing shame to the family, and wanted him killed, he says. Terrified, Allami deserted the military and stuffed a backpack with pants and a few T-shirts. Hrebid paid for his ticket to flee to Lebanon in November 2010.
Seven thousand miles away, Hrebid started his new life in Seattle, the only place he knew someone in the US.
But while he was finally safe, he'd lie awake worrying. What if Allami was detained for overstaying his 30-day tourist visa and deported back to Iraq? A return home now included the risk of arrest by the military for desertion.
A recent documentary ""Out of Iraq"" tells their love story and has won two Emmys.
One day, while at a party, Hrebid met activist Michael Failla and told him about his relationship with Allami. His new friend would become their lifeline.
Living in the shadows
Allami's new life in Beirut did not involve parties and new friendships. He lived in the shadows and worked illegally as a shoe salesman for $250 a month. Hrebid sent him money to help with upkeep as he desperately sought a way to get him to Seattle.
With every day spent away from Hrebid, Allami sank further into depression. He'd sit in bed at night and guzzle bottles of beer.
Hrebid blamed himself as Allami languished in a new country. Despite the time difference, they did their best to maintain a ""normal"" relationship. They would Skype and virtually eat together -- breakfast for one and dinner for the other.
""We would cook together, and discuss things almost like we lived together,"" Hrebid recalls.
They also showered each other with sentimental gifts, including locks of each other's hair.
Hrebid would sit in bed, smell Allami's hair and cry. Other days, he'd send Allami long letters describing his undying love.
""My heart melts at the sound of your voice,"" one letter says. ""When I look at you, I see clear skies.""
In December 2010, desperate to join Hrebid, Allami filed for asylum from the United Nations refugee agency, not knowing it would take years.
Hrebid and Allami look over letters they wrote to each other when they were separated.
The United Nations refugee agency interviewed Allami eight times, but his application was bogged down by translation errors, according to Failla, who attended several interviews with him.
One error in particular complicated his case. During one asylum interview, he was asked whether as a soldier, he was familiar with the Abu Ghraib prison torture. He said he watched it on TV -- but it was translated that he witnessed it first-hand, implying he was complicit, Failla says.
In the process of seeking asylum, applicants can have a preference for country of resettlement, but countries decide whether to accept an applicant.
Allami's preference was the US. But the agonizing wait for a decision was so long, he applied for a separate visa to Canada at its embassy in Beirut.
In March 2013, nearly three years after he escaped from Iraq, Canada said yes.
Allami arrived in Vancouver in May of the same year. He was now 150 miles away from Hrebid, and their dream of living together suddenly seemed within reach.
Hrebid would drive to Vancouver every weekend to see him. On Valentine's Day 2014, they got married at a courthouse in Vancouver, with Failla as a witness.
""We always say Michael was our angel -- the world needs more angels like Michael,"" Hrebid says.
Wedding photos decorate a wall in their living room.
Washington state recognized same-sex marriages at the time, and Hrebid quickly applied for a visa for his new husband at the US Consulate in Montreal.
When the consular official approved it, Allami sat down on the embassy floor and wept. Hrebid covered his mouth and screamed.
""I was shaking so hard,"" Allami says. ""I asked the embassy person to repeat again just to be sure.""
A new chapter
The date March 6, 2015, will forever be etched in Allami's mind. He finally moved to Seattle to be with Hrebid.
A few months later, on August 8 of the same year, they had their dream wedding at Failla's house, surrounded by friends.
Allami (left) and Hrebid on their wedding day in Seattle.
Allami then applied for permanent residency -- known as a greencard -- as Hrebid's husband. The couple relishes their life in Seattle, where they live with their Siberian Husky, Cesar, and cat, Lodus. A rainbow flag draped over the balcony of their new town home flutters in the wind.
Inside their home, black and white photos of their wedding day line the walls. In other photos, they are hiking through the mountains or simply gazing into each other's eyes.
After six years of living on different continents, their new life is idyllic. Hrebid is a kitchen specialist at a home improvement store while Allami is a maintenance worker for a residential building.
Failla describes the couple as ""major influencers"" in the gay community in Seattle. They open their home to LGBT people who've fled the Middle East, help them get jobs and into schools, and teach them about their new culture in the US. They've helped 21 people find jobs and places to stay, and are working with several rights groups such as Canada's Rainbow Refugee to assist more.
Hrebid and Allami play with their dog, Cesar, outside their home.
""First we were the ones who needed help now it's our turn to help,"" Hrebid says. ""Anything we can do, even if it's changing people's minds just by sharing our story.""
Their story is already bringing about change.
Christine Matthews, a deputy director for the UN refugee agency, said last year they used the gaps in Allami's case as a learning experience. They have since launched an effort to sensitize staff on the best ways to process such claims.
""We need to do better for refugees, all refugees including LGBT refugees,"" she said.
And after years of separation, Hrebid still wakes up at night and asks: Am I dreaming or is this real? Are we really married? Will I wake up one day and find you gone?
""It's almost like that fear never leaves you,"" he says.
In Iraq, the two say they are considered an embarrassment to their communities, and family members don't utter their names.
""Out of Iraq,"" a documentary on their romance and fight for asylum, recently won an Emmy, but its two stars say they are hardly feted back home.
Even though they can't go back to Iraq for fear of being killed, they've learned to define ""home"" in their own way.
""He's my family, he's my safe place, my love,"" Allami says as Hrebid gently strokes his face.
""I may not have my country anymore, but he's my country now."""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The search for victims of an earthquake that killed hundreds in Mexico City ended on Wednesday as rescue workers recovered the body of the last person known to be missing beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Deputy Interior Minister Roberto Campa said all the bodies had been recovered from the ruins of an office building in the upscale Roma district of the capital. The search at other buildings that collapsed ended several days ago.
In total 369 people died in the Sept. 19 earthquake, the most deadly in a generation, with almost two-thirds of the fatalities in the capital. Earlier that month, 98 people died when an even more powerful tremor hit the south of the country."
8 Tips to Prepare for an RA Drug Injection,"8 Tips to Prepare for an RA Drug Injection By Beth W. Orenstein

Your treatment for rheumatoid arthritis may require regular injections beneath the skin of strong disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), called biologics. These are medicines engineered from living organisms that moderate your immune system and stop it from attacking you.
Follow these preparation steps for the best results:
1. Get screened. Because biologics suppress your immune system, you may be more susceptible to infection. Before you start your injections, you'll probably be tested for tuberculosis (TB). You may have tuberculosis in your system without knowing it because the bacteria that cause TB can be dormant in your body. Biologics can activate them.
One biologic, rituximab (Rituxan), impairs your B cells, which may make you more likely to get the hepatitis B virus. You should be tested for hepatitis B before you start these injections.
2. Properly time any vaccines you need. If you need any live virus vaccines to prevent conditions like shingles, get them 1 to 3 months before starting your injections of biologics. If you need a flu vaccine, make sure it’s a ""dead"" (or attenuated) virus. Avoid the nasal flu vaccine, which is a ""live"" virus.
3. Review all your medications with your doctor. Go over all medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and any other condition—including vitamins, dietary supplements, and herbal remedies. Your doctor may need to change doses of certain drugs and monitor you for side effects. If you're taking antibiotics for an infection, finish them before you start your injections. (If you have a high fever, you'll probably also need to wait until it's gone.)
4. Get educated about your injectible drug. The more you know about this strong RA medication and its possible side effects, the better prepared you'll be. Ask your doctor for educational materials specific to the drug you'll be taking. Read the materials and watch any available videos. Visit the drug manufacturer’s website for more information, and then talk to your doctor and discuss any concerns before you start treatment.
5. Learn how to inject yourself. Have your doctor or nurse educator show you how, and bring someone with you to lend another set of eyes and ears and to learn how to help you if you need it later on. Usually, the medicine should be injected in the front of your thigh or your stomach. You'll have less discomfort if you don’t always inject yourself at exactly the same spot. Store your medication as directed, usually in the refrigerator. Take it out to warm up to room temperature before injecting.
6. Practice after-treatment safety steps. Watch for side effects. Tell your doctor if you develop a rash or have burning or itching at the site of your injection.
7. Stick to your treatment schedule. This includes follow-up visits with your doctor and any lab tests. Your doctor will need to monitor your response to treatment and stay ahead of any side effects, so be sure to keep all lines of communication open with your doctor's office.
8. Eat a healthy diet. Good nutrition will boost your immune system and help you ward off illness. You want to stay as healthy as you can, especially when receiving drug treatment.
Key Takeaways
Before getting injections, get any needed screenings and make sure you have no infections.
Learn all you can about your RA drug, including side effects to watch for after treatment.
Eat healthy to stay strong, and follow your doctor's advice for staying healthy.

Flacco’s Comfort Zone Must be Challenged,"Flacco’s Comfort Zone Must be Challenged
(Before It's News)
Ravens Need a Viable Plan B at QB
As we enter the fifth week of the NFL season only one team remains unbeaten, the Kansas City Chiefs. A big reason for their success thus far in 2017 has been the surprising play of Alex Smith. Smith has never been a quarterback that puts up eye popping stats. Instead, he’s been at his best as an effective game manager supported by a strong defense and a top tier running game.
Smith, though, has elevated his game this season, having already thrown for over 1000 yards and 8 touchdowns, but more importantly zero interceptions. His decision making has been on point and he’s consistently put his team in a position to succeed.
The Chiefs are in an interesting spot. They spent their first round pick (10th overall) on Pat Mahomes, trading up seventeen spots to get him. Mahomes draft stock rose in the final weeks leading up to the draft. His athletic tools are off the chart but he wasn’t an ideal candidate to start in week one.
Photo Credit: Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire
Most evaluators thought Mahomes had the potential to be a franchise guy but he was still viewed as somewhat raw. However, the investment of a first-round pick certainly means the Chiefs envision him being their franchise guy at some point, and soon. Alex Smith himself, admitted earlier this year that he didn’t expect to be a Chief in 2018.
So did Smith elevate his game this year because he heard the footsteps behind him?
Maybe, maybe not. But it seems awfully coincidental that Smith is having a career year with a little added pressure. The Ravens might be wise to take a similar approach.
This isn’t to say that the Ravens should give up on Joe Flacco, but is there any other quarterback who has consistently played so poorly the last two years without having to once be even slightly concerned about his job security?
Andy Dalton has had to look over his shoulder at AJ McCarron when he’s had rough stretches, Tony Romo lost his job to Dak Prescott while he was still playing at a high level, and Peyton Manning had to fend off Brock Osweiler the year he led the Broncos to the Super Bowl. Yes it’s true that Brock Osweiler is not a good quarterback but that’s beside the point. Even Pro Bowl quarterbacks haven’t felt as comfortable as Joe Flacco has in recent years and that’s because of the way his contract is structured.
But the Ravens do get some flexibility after the 2018 season with their “franchise QB”. The Ravens could save $10.5 million against the cap after next season and a little over $20 million the following year by parting ways with Flacco.
It’s in the Ravens best interest that the Super Bowl 47 MVP finds a way to return to the level of play that he achieved in 2012 and later under the tutelage of Gary Kubiak in 2014. But what if he doesn’t?
The Ravens will have a substantial list of needs going into next year’s draft but taking a quarterback in the second or third round won’t prohibit them from addressing other areas. We won’t know if Tyus Bowser will evolve into a difference maker but the Ravens wouldn’t be a worse team if neither Kamalei Correa (2016, second round) nor Maxx Williams (2015, second round) were missing from the team’s roster.
The second round of the draft hasn’t been kind to Ozzie Newsome in recent years, so taking a shot on a quarterback who has legitimate potential won’t set the organization back significantly. Derek Carr was drafted in the second round of the 2014 draft. He’s been one of the biggest reasons the Raiders have returned to relevance after years of insignificance. The Packers had Brett Favre and they drafted Aaron Rodgers. The Patriots have Tom Brady and they drafted Jimmy Garoppolo. There’s been chatter of the Ravens finding Flacco’s eventual successor soon anyway. Taking him in next year’s draft wouldn’t be a huge stretch.
And again, there’s also the comfort factor. Maybe Flacco needs to be pushed to get the most out of him. He was motivated in 2012 because it was a contract year and that seemed to work out. Gary Kubiak managed to get the most out of him in 2014 as well. But if Harbaugh can’t find another Kubiak, which it appears he can’t, maybe this is the best way to light a spark under the Joe Flacco.
The Ravens have never made their 10-year signal caller feel uncomfortable. He’s never had to look over his shoulder and and wonder if he might get the hook. The Ravens, for the first time, might have some leverage when it comes to his contract after next season and if they take a quarterback early in next year’s draft maybe it will be the motivation Flacco needs to elevate his game.
What have they got to lose?
Another wasted second-round pick?

Thursday Morning Briefing,"U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the South Lawn before their meeting about the NAFTA trade agreement at the White House in Washington, U.S. October 11, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst
U.S. President Trump said he would be open to bilateral pacts with Canada and Mexico if NAFTA talks fail, Brexit talks continued in Brussels but with little sign of progress and Delta Airlines said it would refuse to pay tariffs on Bombardier’s CSeries jets.
NAFTA
U.S. President Donald Trump said he was open to bilateral trade pacts with either Canada or Mexico if a three-way deal cannot be reached to substantially revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump’s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA’s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington.
Business leaders say no NAFTA better than bad deal
Washington
The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to approve $36.5 billion in emergency relief for hurricane-hit areas such as Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as California, struck by devastating wildfires.
Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility. Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an “embarrassment” and the “worst deal ever negotiated.”
Trump healthcare order could face strong legal objections
Trump told workers that they would win under his tax plan, saying it would help the middle class and boost the economy, though critics say it would mainly benefit corporations and the rich.
North Korea revealed
In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the widely-available Computer Numerical Control machine plays a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports. Read the report.
Business
Asian stocks reached a 10-year high, riding the bull run in global equity markets, while the dollar sagged after the Federal Reserve showed a more guarded view towards inflation.
Delta Air Lines said it would refuse to pay a 300 percent U.S. tariff on Canadian-built Bombardier CSeries jets, raising doubts about its purchase of 75 of the new aircraft at a list price of more than $5 billion. Delta is the only major U.S. carrier to buy the CSeries so far, and Bastian called the U.S. Commerce Department’s decision to impose anti-dumping duties on the jets “nonsensical.”

As negotiators in Brussels make little progress before Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders next week, a warning about a breakdown in talks from a minister seen strongly to favor a business-friendly “bespoke” transition out of the EU came a day after the EU summit chair spoke of a similar new year deadline.

Best known for the 2010 Broadway musical “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” Mr. Friedman leaves behind several uncompleted shows, including a musical adaptation of “All the President’s Men” — a project he had excitedly presented in June to the book’s receptive authors, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.

Now his friends and family are struggling to rewind the events of the summer, asking what they, or Mr. Friedman, could have done in response to signs of trouble.
“I wish I could have done more,” said the director Michael Greif (“Dear Evan Hansen,” “Rent”). “I wish I had known more. I wish I could have interceded more. I wish that I could have found a way to let Michael let me be a better friend to him, and I regret that I wasn’t able to do that.”
Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, where Mr. Friedman worked off and on for 20 years, called his death “a real warning shot across the bow for anybody who thinks this disease isn’t deadly any more.”
“It just killed one of the most brilliant and promising people in the American theater,” he said.

‘Things Were Getting Better’
Mr. Friedman had a new job this year, one seemingly perfect for a musical-theater obsessive. He was the artistic director of Encores! Off-Center, an annual New York City Center summer program that presents short-run concert revivals of Off Broadway shows.
“The guy was an encyclopedia,” said Anne Kauffman, who met Mr. Friedman in 1999 at the Williamstown Theater Festival, and who he chose to direct his first Encores! production, “Assassins.”
“He wanted his pals there — it felt like, we had been children together, and now he’d got a grown-up job, and he was like, ‘Hey, do this with me’,” she said.
Tall, gangly and gay, he was an outsized presence — exuberant and emotional, witty and irreverent, opinionated and self-doubting. “When he was at City Center, you knew he was in the halls,” said Arlene Shuler, the performing arts center’s president and chief executive.
But it was also obvious to his collaborators that he was not well. Always thin, he now seemed gaunt. He complained of recurrent gastrointestinal trouble.
Most disturbing, there were purple splotches on his face. Several people who saw him early this summer said they thought the spots looked like the lesions associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, but then dismissed that thought.
“Of course the first thing you think of is KS, because of all those images from the ’80s, but then the other part of you is, ‘It’s 2017, so of course that’s not what it is; he has some other issue’,” said Trip Cullman, a director and close friend. “I was very concerned, and would try to bring it up as much as I could, but I also knew how much he valued privacy, and didn’t want to be pushy. I obviously very much regret that now.”
In mid-July, Mr. Friedman made it to the first two performances of “Assassins,” but with obvious difficulty.

“The day of the opening, we walked up five stairs, and got to the top, and Michael was completely winded,” said Sam Pinkleton, a choreographer and the associate artistic director of Encores! Off-Center. “Then he pulled me and others aside and told us that he was diagnosed positive. My gut response was, I know a lot of people who are H.I.V. positive, and this is not what they’re like — this is somebody whose body is in the process of being cannibalized.”
On July 14, Mr. Friedman showed up for a meet-and-greet with the cast of a second show, “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin,” and then went straight to the hospital.
“He said he had H.I.V., he was going to the emergency room, and could I bring him a phone charger,” recalled Daniel Goldstein, a director and writer who also befriended him at Williamstown. “They had caught it at a rather advanced stage, but the drugs were working, and we all thought things were getting better.”
Mr. Friedman, who had health insurance as an employee of the Public Theater, where he was an artist-in-residence and director of an audience engagement program, had known he was H.I.V. positive only since early July, when he was tested by his primary care physician, according to his sister, Marion Friedman Young. He began taking antiretroviral medications that month.
His first hospital stay lasted 10 days, before he was sent home to recuperate. His immune system had been compromised, but his friends and family were hopeful that over time he would make a recovery. By text, he kept friends updated on his progress. By email, he was outlining plans for next summer.
“Every part of me expected him to break through the door of City Center, with an IV hooked up to his arm, shouting something, and the fact that he didn’t frightened me, a lot,” Mr. Pinkleton said. “This was somebody I’d watched be an aircraft carrier for 10 years, and he turned into a baby bird.”

On Aug. 19, he was readmitted to NYU Langone Medical Center with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He spent the rest of his life in the intensive care unit, intubated and periodically sedated. Family was with him daily; friends visited as much as possible.
When he was awake, he would converse by writing down his thoughts and showing them to visitors. But there were moments of stillness as well. “Often we were just being silent,” Mr. Goldstein said, “holding hands and watching the U.S. Open.”
In early September, his doctors detected another infection, and his body was not strong enough to fight it off. The consensus among his friends is that Mr. Friedman had waited too long to seek medical attention.

“As near as I can tell, he hadn’t actually been to a doctor or gotten tested for a couple of years, and only in July did he find out that he was H.I.V. positive,” Mr. Eustis said “That’s just staggering — staggeringly wrong of Michael, staggeringly upsetting.”
Upsetting, and poignant too. Mr. Friedman and several close collaborators were hoping to pursue a sequel to “A Chorus Line.” The original musical, about a group of auditioning dancers, was set in 1975; the sequel would have been set a decade later, as that same generation of dreamers was laid waste by AIDS.
‘Make This Piece for Him’
The cast of “The Abominables,” tricked out in hockey uniforms, was in-line skating around the stage at the Children’s Theater Company in Minneapolis, a few hours before opening. One of them was costumed as a Yeti.

It was Friday, Sept. 15, six days after Mr. Friedman died, and the week had been wildly emotional. On Sunday, the theater’s artistic director, Peter C. Brosius, had informed the cast that Mr. Friedman, the show’s composer and lyricist, had died the day before. He chose his words carefully, because many of the actors were children and had never met Mr. Friedman.
“The American theater has lost an original voice,” he recalled saying. “We’ve been given a great honor and responsibility to make this piece for him.”
Then on Tuesday, the show’s director and book writer, Steven Cosson, had set aside his own grief — he was Mr. Friedman’s most frequent collaborator and a close friend — to urge the cast to have fun with the show. “I didn’t want anyone to feel bad about enjoying this play,” Mr. Cosson said. “That’s why we made it, and that’s what he would want to happen.”
So now it was time to open, and it was hard to untangle the excitement from the sadness. “It’s on us to give it the life it deserves,” said Reed Sigmund, one of the adult performers.
“The Abominables,” as a musical for family audiences, was a new venture for Mr. Friedman, whose astonishing output had already included musicalizations of Shakespeare’s comedy “Love’s Labour’s Lost” and Jonathan Lethem’s novel “The Fortress of Solitude.”

He was a founding associate artist with The Civilians, a downtown documentary theater troupe, and with them he had honed his gift for making music out of everyday speech, writing songs for shows about evangelicals, gentrification and the pornography industry, among other subjects.
The Minneapolis theater — one of the nation’s leading children’s theaters — had commissioned the Civilians six years ago to produce a work with local flavor.
Informed by interviews with Minnesotans, “The Abominables” is a clever, zany and silly show about an adolescent hockey player whose ambitions are thwarted when a talented Yeti comes to town. It is also about the culture of success, and learning to accept defeat.
A few hours before the opening, his collaborators honored Mr. Friedman with teary speeches over a dinner (Minnesota-themed, with a Tater Tot hotdish). “He feels very present,” Mr. Cosson said. “I’m talking with him in my mind.”
The show’s New York-based costume designer, Jessica Pabst, was wistful as she sat in the theater’s 746-seat auditorium. “You don’t think of your contemporaries dying,” she said. “You think of people getting sick, and then they’ll get better. And I couldn’t wait to show him pictures of the Yeti.”

But Ms. Pabst said she took heart watching children respond to the show. “These are the next generation of Michael Friedman superfans,” she said. “These children will go home singing these songs, and that feels like an unbelievable legacy and gift.”
Unfinished
Mr. Friedman had much more he wanted to say.
“There is a mountain of stuff — notebooks and sheet music and ideas, an extraordinary archive of finished and half-finished works, and the kernels of ideas,” Mr. Cullman said.
Fully drafted are “The King of Kong,” a musical adaptation of the video game documentary, with Alex Timbers directing and Robert Askins writing, and “American Pop,” a cultural history written with Mr. Cullman on commission from the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. “All the President’s Men,” which Mr. Friedman was developing with the producers Ira Pittelman and Tom Hulce, was still in its early stages.

And then there were the still-under-discussion ideas: the “Chorus Line” sequel, with Mr. Cosson and Mr. Pinkleton, as well as a modern adaptation of “The Magic Flute,” for the Public Theater and the Metropolitan Opera.
“There is this grief at the work that won’t be finished — all the things he was talking about that I wanted to watch him work through,” said Will Frears, a director and writer and one of Mr. Friedman’s closest friends. “He wrote about difficult things in difficult ways, and my great wish is that the completed work moves forward and remains risky — that it doesn’t get turned into some nice warm thing, but remains an exhilarating and difficult look at the world.”
Now there will be memorials — the Public is planning one this month for friends and colleagues — and revivals; Mr. Eustis vows “to do everything I can to push his work to the forefront.” Kurt Deutsch of Sh-K-Boom/Ghostlight Records is working with Mr. Cosson to preserve unreleased songs; Ms. Kauffman is collecting audio recordings of Mr. Friedman teaching songs and giving advice to actors and directors.
One week after his death, on Sept. 16, several hundred of Mr. Friedman’s family and friends — theater world dignitaries, of course, but also his prom date, and a third grade classmate, and the high school choir teacher — gathered in the austere meetinghouse at Germantown Friends School, a private school in Philadelphia where Mr. Friedman had been educated from kindergarten through 12th grade.
He was remembered with stories, songs and reminiscences: he played a pig in a school musical; he started a madrigals club; he loved “My Spirit Sang All Day,” a composition by Gerald Finzi adapted from poetry by Robert Bridges. At one point, a playwright, Eisa Davis, posed a question: “I just wonder if Michael loved himself as much as we loved him?”
It was a Quaker meeting, full of silences between the speakers.
“I think, weirdly, silence is the thing Michael was most afraid of,” Mr. Goldstein said. “If there was space, he would fill it.”"
Australian Cybersecurity Report Shows Gaps in Private Companies’ Defenses,"Experts say that private industry has been one of the most glaring vulnerabilities in Australia’s cybersecurity. Tuesday’s report, the Australian Cyber Security Center Threat Report, noted that 734 private-sector systems of “national interest” were affected by cyberattacks last year.
“Certain companies take cybersecurity quite seriously,” said Alana Maurushat, academic co-director of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Center at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “But you have key industries to Australia who — while there may not be the same media coverage — you know through internal sources are being breached. Our mining industry has notoriously been rumored to have been breached by competitors.”
Ms. Maurushat said that Australia as a whole was not far behind the rest of the developed world’s level of cybersecurity, but emphasized concerns about its private sector.
“The crazy thing about this is that they don’t even know that they’ve been breached,” she said. “There are certain breaches that occur, and there are studies on this, where sometimes someone would be on your system for almost a year, without the breach even being noticed. That’s the stuff that keeps me up at night.”
A cybersecurity report released this year by Telstra, the country’s dominant telecommunications company, said that 59 percent of surveyed companies in Australia had detected a security breach on at least a monthly basis. A similar number reported experiencing at least one ransomware attack. Over half of Australian organizations that came under such an attack paid the ransom, the report said.

Ms. Maurushat said that, in part, Australia’s private-sector cybersecurity was lacking because of an acute shortage of skilled workers.
The government report also noted “extensive” state-sponsored activity against Australia’s government, saying that its defense contractors continued to be targeted by foreign nations’ cyberespionage efforts.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Tehan said that the government was pivoting toward offensive capabilities to “prevent and shut down safe havens for offshore cybercriminals.”

Last year, the Australian government blamed foreign actors for an attack on its online census portal.
“The whole census thing — that’s an I.B.M. mistake,” Ms. Maurushat said, referring to the technology company’s contracting role in the census. “That’s not a government mistake, that’s an industry mistake, from a company you wouldn’t expect to make those errors.”
In a settlement over the census problems, I.B.M. paid the government about 30 million Australian dollars, or about $23 million.
Not unlike vaccines and herd immunity, Ms. Maurushat said, a government’s cybersecurity is only as strong as those it chooses to share its data with.
When asked whether Australia’s lagging digital infrastructure and poor internet speeds might have a detrimental effect on its security, Ms. Maurushat said that a beleaguered attempt to speed up Australia’s internet, the National Broadband Network initiative, may prove to be a silver lining.
“It’s the opposite,” she said, adding that hackers rely on fast internet speeds. “So in some ways, if the N.B.N. is a disaster, it might be better for us.”"
The Chicago Bears versus the Minnesota Vikings In-Depth Game Preview,"The Chicago Bears versus the Minnesota Vikings In-Depth Game Preview
(Before It's News)
By Bryan Dietzler
The Chicago Bears, fresh off a loss to division rival Green Bay, will host the Minnesota Vikings in their only Monday night appearance of the 2017 season. The Vikings are coming off a loss as well, 14-7 at the hands of division rival Detroit. They are desperately looking for a win. They come in with a record of 2-2 while the Bears have won just one game this season.
By now everyone knows that rookie quarterback Mitchell Trubisky will start Monday night. He replaces someone who could never quite do what the Bears needed him to do in Mike Glennon. The future is now, and it’s time they start to move forward. And with such a heavy investment in Mitch, it’s about time they did.
With this game being Trubisky’ s first start it will be a tough outing for the Bears’ passing game. It was already anemic and mistake-ridden air attack anyway so why not move forward instead of keeping it in neutral. That must have been what the Bears’ decision makers thought when they decided to put Mitch in.
We won’t talk about the Bears pass offense rankings. You can throw all that out now that Trubisky is in the lineup. The rookie will be facing the league’s 24th ranked pass defense so there will be some opportunities for them to pass the ball if they can get him going.
And if Mitch can throw the ball well hopefully his receivers will be there to not only catch it but hang onto it.
Mitch may want to rely on some of the team’s strongest pass catchers, their tight ends. Guys like Zach Miller and Dion Sims could help the rookie gain some comfort, and they could be a safety outlet when the heat is on. Trubisky needs to find a receiver he can rely upon and one of the tight ends would be a great outlet for him to throw the ball too.
When it comes to pass protection, the Vikings defense can get to the quarterback. They have 11 sacks in four games and their leader in sacks is Everson Griffen with five. Griffen will present many problems for the Bears’ offensive line. He will be going up against the likes of Charles Leno Jr., who, despite his critics, is one of the better offensive left tackles in the game.
Leno will have his work cut out for him on Monday night though.
The secondary for the Vikings has some great players in it. There is Bear “killer” safety Harrison Smith. Chicago fans know him all too well. He and two other teammates have one interception a piece this season so Trubisky better be wary of where Harrison and those guys are. If he finds them too often, it will be a long night.
The Vikings do play well against the run. Coming into the game, the Vikings are ranked third in the league allowing 71.2 yards per game. The Bears must run the ball to win and they could find it difficult Monday night. But having all of their offensive linemen healthy and ready to go will go a long ways to ensuring that they can run the ball. Chicago will see some success running the ball against the Vikings.
Remember last Halloween?
The Bears rushing offense is gaining an average of 117.5 yards per game which is 12th in the league. The Bears can win games on the ground so if they can run the ball well, they can win. But will the Vikings let them?
Minnesota’s best linebacker is Anthony Barr. Barr has recorded 26 total tackles this season and can make plays anywhere on the field. The Bears have to be wary of him. Taking care of Barr, who plays on the outside, will be the job of either Leno Jr., Massie or a tight end when the Bears run the ball.
Hopefully, those blockers will be able to take him out of the picture and free up some running room.
The will also need to worry about the Vikings leading tackler strong safety Andrew Sendejo. He can make plays in the secondary and will sneak up to play the run. Every blocker the Bears have available on Monday needs to be wary of those Sendejo and the aforementioned Smith. They can dominate any game.
Going back to the passing game, I don’t want to sound like a broken record but the Bears receiving corps is anemic. There is no star in that group and no one has stepped up to be their number one wide receiver. And with a rookie quarterback that makes his development even more difficult.
Aside from the tight ends and running, is there any other receiver who can step up?
The Bears have gotten some good play out of their defense and they can help Chicago win games if their offense can limit the mistakes.
The defense has been rocked by injuries as the linebacker and safety groups have seen starters go down. Of course, we all know that Jerrell Freeman is gone for the season and Nick Kwiatkoski is a few weeks away from coming back. Strong safety Quintin Demps will be out as also. And now outside linebacker Willie Young has been added to the injured reserve list.
Danny Trevathan will miss the game due to a suspension but even though the Bears’ defense is hurting they can still play and play well.
It’s not yet known who the Bears will face at quarterback for the Vikings. At last check, Sam Bradford was still a day to day decision. Case Keenum has been a good game manager and had a nice game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but Chicago needs not to let him repeat that performance. They can prevent that with a solid performance from their pass rushing defense.
The Bears pass defense is ranked 15th against the pass allowing 220.8 yards per game. Minnesota’s passing offense is gaining an average of 263.2 yards per game which is 8th in the NFL. The Bears will have their work cut out for them. But not knowing who will play quarterback makes it a little hard to prepare.
The Vikings receivers are pretty good. Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs are two very capable wide receivers. Diggs already has four touchdowns this season and is difficult to cover.
The Bears must shut him down.
Chicago’s secondary has its slip-ups, but overall, they can be solid. They have some strong players at the cornerback spot and use a three-man rotation to help keep things fresh. Prince Amukamara, Kyle Fuller, and Marcus Cooper are the starters. Bryce Callahan comes in as a nickel back and has done well this season.
There is a lot of talent in this group.
But the pass rush is the key component for making sure the Vikings can’t pass the ball all over the field. Chicago’s defense currently has nine sacks this year. Their leaders there are Pernell McPhee and Willie Young with two apiece. When you compare that to the top team in the NFL in sacks (which is Jacksonville with 18) that’s not great at all.
The Bears must get pass pressure on whoever the quarterback is for Minnesota. And now that Willie Young is out for the year, rushing the passer will get tougher.
Chicago’s most capable pass rushers are Akiem Hicks, Leonard Floyd, and Pernell McPhee. They will go up against an offensive line that has allowed just five sacks all season.
Getting a sack on Monday night is going to be difficult for the Bears. But even if they can’t get sacks, they can hurry the quarterback and make him rush his throws. That could help generate turnovers which the Bears will desperately need to stay in this game.
Stopping the run hasn’t been difficult for Chicago. They’ve allowed just 85.5 yards through four games which is good for sixth in the NFL. The Vikings have rushed for 108 yards on average which is ranked 17th. Remember that their leading rusher, Cook, is out for the year. So, facing a new running back may either be good or bad for Chicago.
When it comes to points scored per game, Minnesota is ranked 19th scoring 19.8 per game. Chicago is allowing a whopping 26 points per game which is ranked 27th. The Bears need to turn that around and start holding opponents to fewer points.
Maybe they can start against the Vikings? If they want to win they must that and this is the game to start a new trend.
When it comes to special teams, the Bears have some trouble in the kicking game with Connor Barth. Their dissatisfaction with Barth showed this week as they brought in some other kickers to try out. However, as this article is being written, the Bears have not signed a new kicker.
Barth is two of four on field goals this year which is disappointing. Compare that to Vikings kicker Kai Forbath who has made all but one of his field goals this season (six of seven). The edge here goes to the Vikings. The problem is if the game comes down to a field goal kick the Bears may not be able to win the game or trust Barth to win it.
That’s unfortunate.
The Vikings leading kick return specialist is Jerick McKinnon and he has a 26.1-yard return average. Chicago’s kick return teams are allowing an average of 17.5 yards per return. They must not allow McKinnon or any other special teamer make a mockery of them on Monday night.
The team that plays the best on special teams may win the game as a mistake on special teams could help swing a close game in one team’s favor.
The Bears leading kick return specialist is Deonte Thompson with a 23.3-yard average. Minnesota’s special teams are allowing 22.6 yards per return the numbers are even. Maybe the Bears can get something going here.
Pat O’Donnell has been solid this season. His average is 48.6 but the most important thing is that he has dropped eight punts inside the 20. The Bears should be very comfortable with him punting the ball. Minnesota’s special teams units feature Marcus Sherels who is averaging a lowly 5.6 yards per return. The Bears’ punt coverage teams, which are allowing just 8.7 yards per return so they aren’t getting killed there.
The Vikings punter, Ryan Quigley, has a 42.7-yard average with seven placed inside the 20. The Bears punt return specialists are averaging 8.7 yards while Tarik Cohen leads the way with 7.8 yards per attempt. Chicago needs someone to break some long returns and either get good field position or get into the end zone.
That will help them win this or any game.
The coaching staffs for both teams are very experienced. When it comes down to the head coaches and what they have to offer, Fox may have an advantage over Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer in years being a head coach. However, Zimmer is a smart coach who makes good decisions.
They match up well with against one another.
Anytime these two teams get together; the outcome is difficult to predict. Last year, in their first game, no one expected the Bears to beat the Vikings. At that point, Minnesota was having a strong season while the Bears were struggling like they are now. But Chicago derailed the Vikings so anything is possible on any given day in any game between these two teams.
This being Mitchell Trubisky’s first start, it will be a tough outing for the Bears. But I hope I am wrong. Every Bears’ fan hopes that Trubisky will be able to play a strong first-ever game. Coupled with a strong rushing attack and opportunistic defense, maybe he can help the Bears win.
But they won’t win it. It will be close but they will fall just short. Trust me; there will be better days ahead for the Bears.

SF 9 ARI 2
Even with a lopsided win, this team still makes me feel like I wasted my evening watching them. The Diamondbacks, fresh off clinching a post season berth, played like it. All their stars had the day off and the rest of them had apparently partied all night. Four errors and a bunch of bad pitching later, the Giants had meaningless win #62. Yippee!
Cueto (8-8) gave the Giants another solid outing (game score 64, 6 innings, 5 hits, 2 runs, 7 K). He sure has had a hard time getting easy outs since coming back. I guess that is a small criticism…but his pitch counts have been crazy lately. Not sure that it means anything.
Our boys made a bit of noise with the bats tonight. They scored 5 runs in an inning for the first time in 5 weeks. Hundley had a big 4 RBI night, including the game breaking 3 run homer. Parker got three hits, including a couple doubles. He hit it hard to all fields and looked good doing it.
What a shame it meant not a thing. Only a few more meaningless games left! Thank Willie.

The Ancient Tomb Of Santa Claus May Have Been Discovered In Turkey,"Turkish archaeologists could be about to solve a mystery that has gone on for many thousands of years as they have found an ancient tomb among the ruins of a church and they believe it is the tomb of Saint Nicholas, who became known as Santa Claus.
 
Tomb Of Saint Nicholas Could Be Under St. Nicholas Church In Antalya
 
One portion of the site is thought to hold a grave that seems to be undamaged and it was found at St. Nicholas Church in the Antalya province of Turkey.
 
The church is in the Demre district and this was known to the saint’s place of birth. Cemil Karabayram, the head of the Antalya Monument Authority said that the shrine was uncovered when they were making electronic surveys. The surveys revealed gaps underneath the church and the discovery was made.
 
He said that the shrine does not appear to have been damaged in any way but there has been some difficulty in getting to it thanks to the mosaics on the floor. It was said that while the excavation process was taking place the archaeologists had to loosen each of the tiles from the mosaics and they removed in a mold.
 
Experts in Turkey have now said that what they thought had been the original grave of Santa Claus was the grave of a priest and his undamaged grave has now been found underneath St. Nicholas Church in Turkey. However, the claims about the remains of Saint Nicholas, which would be 1,674 years old, compete with narratives that differ that say the original relics of the saint could be in Italy or Ireland.
 
Body Was Said To Be In Italy, Venice Or Ireland
 
Saint Nicholas died in 343 A.D and he was said to have been interred in a church in Demre, which was called Myra, and this is where he lay until the 11th century. Italy had accounts that differed as they said that the body was taken to Venice or Italy during the crusades. Another story is that the remains of Saint Nicholas were taken to a churchyard that is now abandoned in the south of Ireland as French knights had taken them there.
 
Many Orthodox Christians and Catholics believe that the final resting place of Saint Nicholas was the Basilica di San Nicola in Italy. Experts in Turkey say that the wrong person’s bones had been removed and the ones that were taken abroad had belonged to a priest that is unknown.
 
Eight Different Fields Of Study Researchers Involved In Uncovering Grave
 
Karabayram has said that he is optimistic about unearthing the remains of Saint Nicholas. He said that researchers from eight different fields of study had been involved in the process of unearthing the grave.
 
Santa Claus came from the 3rd and 4th-century bishop Saint Nicholas to become the figure that he is known to be today, associated with Christmas celebrated by Christians. He became popular in the 16th century in Europe when he was given the name of Father Christmas, while the Dutch call him Sinterklaas, which eventually gave way to the name of Santa Claus in the US.

Kazuo Ishiguro keeps calm amid Nobel Prize frenzy,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Kazuo Ishiguro talks to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz
""How should a Nobel laureate dress?"" asked Kazuo Ishiguro, who, 40 minutes earlier, had found out he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature.
To say the news was unexpected is an understatement. He literally couldn't believe it.
Until, that was, his phone began to ring constantly, an orderly queue of TV crews started to form outside his front door (""how do they all know where I live?""), and his publishers dispatched a top team to his house as back-up.
This was not fake news. This was delightful, surprising news. Maybe there were others who should have won instead, he wondered. ""But that is the nature of prizes. They are a lottery.""
While chaos reigned around him, he was calm, assured and thoughtful, talking (after nipping upstairs to fetch a smart jacket for our interview) about his belief in the power of stories and how those that he wrote would often explore wasted lives and opportunities.
Image copyright PA Image caption TV crews and reporters flocked to Ishiguro's London home
""I've always had a faith that it should be possible, if you tell stories in a certain way, to transcend barriers of race, class and ethnicity.""
For me, he is one of the great living writers working in any language. All writers can tell stories. Ishiguro tells stories on another level.

Growing up in England in a Japanese household was crucial to his writing, he says, enabling him to see things from a different perspective to many of his British peers.
It is most obvious in the slightly detached nature of many of his narrators, which he explains as coming from ""a long tradition in Japanese art towards a surface calm and surface restraint. There is a felling emotions can feel more intense if they are held down to the surface level"".
There was nothing superficial about his emotions when we met earlier today. He was chuffed to bits, and rightly so.

Some Republicans open to banning 'bump stocks' used in Vegas,"Senior congressional Republicans said Wednesday they are open to considering legislation banning ""bump stocks"" like the shooter in Las Vegas apparently used to make semi-automatic rifles perform more like fully automatic weapons.
The comments from lawmakers including the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, marked a surprising departure from GOP lawmakers' general antipathy to gun regulations of any kind. But they were far from a guarantee of a path forward for the new legislation by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., especially with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan making clear their priorities are elsewhere.
""If somebody can essentially convert a semi-automatic weapon by buying one of these and utilizing it and cause the kind of mayhem and mass casualties that we saw in Las Vegas, that's something of obvious concern that we ought to explore,"" Cornyn told reporters.
""I own a lot of guns and as a hunter and sportsman I think that's our right as Americans, but I don't understand the use of this bump stock and that's another reason to have a hearing.""
Cornyn later said he'd spoken with Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, and that Grassley was interested in convening a hearing.
The devices, known as ""bump stocks"" among other names, are legal and originally were intended to help people with limited hand mobility fire a semi-automatic without the individual trigger pulls required. They can fit over the rear shoulder-stock assembly on a semi-automatic rifle and with applied pressure cause the weapon to fire continuously, increasing the rate from between 45 and 60 rounds per minute to between 400 and 800 rounds per minute, according to Feinstein's office.
The government gave its seal of approval to selling the devices in 2010 after concluding that they did not violate federal law.
Feinstein has a career-long history on the issue of guns after becoming mayor in San Francisco after her predecessor was gunned down. She authored an assault weapons ban that was in place for a decade before expiring in 2004, and said she had been considering trying to reintroduce that more sweeping legislation, as she's done unsuccessfully after past mass shootings, including the one at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged her to go with a narrower bill that might be likelier to draw support.
Feinstein pleaded with the public to pressure Congress to consider her legislation after the horrific violence earlier this week when a gunman killed 58 people and injured hundreds at an outdoor concert that she said her own daughter had considered attending.
""Mr. and Mrs. America, you have to stand up, you have to say 'enough is enough,'"" Feinstein said. ""Why can't we keep a weapon from becoming a military-grade weapon?""
The National Rifle Association, which has played a major role in exerting political pressure against gun curbs, did not respond to inquiries about its stance on Feinstein's bill.
At least one Republican senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said outright he was prepared to vote to ban bump stocks. ""I have no problem in banning those,"" he said.
Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Republican senator, said, ""I'm interest in finding out more about bump stocks and I've got my staff looking into that and I know there are other members interested in finding out more about it as well.""
Even so, asked Tuesday about bump stocks and whether they should be legal, McConnell, R-Ky., said it was not an appropriate time to be discussing legislation.
Ryan, R-Wis., made similar comments Wednesday in a radio interview on WISN in Milwaukee.
""What I don't think you want your government to do is to lurch toward reactions before even having all the facts,"" Ryan said. ""Bad people are going to do bad things.""
In the House, meanwhile, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., introduced a bill to ban the manufacture, possession, transfer, sale or importation of bump stocks. Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., whose district includes the site of Sunday night's rampage, said: ""The victims and families in Las Vegas don't need an explanation about the difference between machine guns and firearms with bump stocks. They need action.""
Congress' recent history gives little cause to think Republicans would take any action on guns. Even after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting where schoolchildren were slaughtered, Feinstein's reintroduced assault weapons ban went nowhere, and bipartisan background check legislation by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania fell short on the Senate floor.
Last year, after the mass shooting at a dance club in Orlando, Florida, Democrats commandeered the House floor to protest GOP inaction on guns, but while garnering headlines the tactic did not yield results. Shooting incidents involving lawmakers themselves, like at a baseball practice earlier this year where Majority Whip Steve Scalise was critically injured, have not changed the calculus.
Feinstein held out hope that this time would be different because of the scale of casualties and the weaponry ""taking it into war."" And Manchin said that he planned to meet with Toomey on the background checks bill, but would not reintroduce it without significant GOP support, which he said ""ain't going to happen unless the president gives his stamp of approval.""
President Donald Trump visited Las Vegas on Wednesday but said ""We're not going to talk about that today"" when asked about gun issues.

Securing Your Home’s Door: Secrets Your Locksmith Won’t Tell You,"Securing Your Home’s Door: Secrets Your Locksmith Won’t Tell You

http://robertsiciliano.com/
Are you making a big home security mistake? If you are leaving your doors unlocked, or if you are using low quality lock systems, you are putting yourself…and your home…at risk.
However, just because your door is locked, it doesn’t mean that a burglar can’t kick the door down. But, having the door locked can make it more difficult. This is only one secret that your local locksmith won’t tell you, but there are several more. Here are a few:
Securing Your Doors
Reinforce the door frame around the hinge and lock. Consider door reinforcement kits, such as Door Devil.
Install a peephole.
Don’t answer the door unless you are expecting a visitor. Tell the same to your kids.
Install hardened steel deadbolts. These are highly encouraged. Make sure they have a five-pin tumbler, too.
Consider multi-lock deadbolts or vertical deadbolts.
Accessories for Your Door to Make it More Secure
Consider a door brace. These will help to prevent a burglar from opening the door.
A wedge or door stop will likely not totally stop a burglar, but if you choose one with an alarm, anyone in the home will definitely hear it.
A door chain will not protect you. It doesn’t take a lot of pressure to break them.
Additional Tips for Door Security
Replace your hollow wood door with a metal or solid wood door.
Choose a door that does NOT have a window. An intruder can easily break a window and access the lock.
If you have a current door that DOES have a window, install attractive metal bars over the glass.
Make sure the hinges of the door are not visible on the outside of the door.
Consider installing a cross bar. This is a heavy steel bar that you can place across the inside of the door.
Inspect deadbolts. Any deadbolt that is low quality should be replaced. If you want to have even more security, install a second deadbolt.
Use door braces when you can. Take one of these braces and stick it under the knob of the door. The other end will remain on the floor at an angle to the doorknob. These are great devices, but too many people forget to put the brace up before they go to bed or leave the home. It is useless if it is just leaning against the wall, and it only takes a couple of seconds to put into place.
For the best door security, think about installing some type of door reinforcement kit. Imagine how secure your door would be with 1/16-inch of heavy steel. No one could kick through that! Also, imagine a four-foot metal bar that you install right over the strike plates and screw directly into the frame of the door. This will give you one tough security system on your door, and it’s exactly what the door jamb security kit from Door Devil offers. See here on YouTube.

Train Stations to use Facial Recognition and Palm Vein Scanners for Payment,"[gard align='center']
By MassPrivateI
Editor’s Note: The stages of incrementalism seem to be speeding up. Nicholas West has written for Activist Post just this month about China’s high tech KFC called KPRO turning to facial recognition for payment, as well as a UK supermarket becoming the world’s first to use finger vein scans for its customers. The use of biometrics was, of course, first peddled as a necessary security measure, so we have seen it spread in that capacity from planes to trains and even for event security. Now the cashless agenda can more aggressively make its move for the full roll-out of biometric identification and payment into every facet of daily life.
The article below from MassPrivateI offers additional context for what is now leading to biometric payment systems at train stations.
The TSA is winning the war on Americans minds as commuters are being tricked into giving away their rights without a fight.
The above video warns that facial recognition body scanners are coming to a train station near you…
Soon you might have to pass through one of these to get to your train or subway.
Last week, the TSA Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority ‘voluntarily’ asked commuters to walk through facial recognition body scanners before being allowed to board a train.
If you watched the video you might have noticed that the mass media (CBS) did not interview a single person who was concerned about their privacy. Instead, they quoted passengers who think body scanners are a good thing.
Nothing suspicious about that, right?
CBS warned that if the LA Metro installs body scanners next year, commuters won’t be able to opt-out.
According to an article in the LA Times, the LA Metro has begun piloting biometric body scanners that send short-wave radio frequencies through commuters’ bodies to search for bombs and weapons.
A ‘pilot program’ is really a government euphemism for gauging the public’s response to another intrusive police search.
Updated 9/26:
Train stations to use facial recognition and palm vein scanners
UK commuters will be identified by using either a palm vein scanner or facial recognition.
The palm vein scanner uses an infrared sensor to capture the pattern of blood vessels in your hand. At the moment, Cubic envisages that a rider would go to a station to register their palm print and link it to their payment account. Then, when they put their hand on the scanner before a journey, the scanner will recognize their palm and charge their account. “The point being you could use your hand rather than your oyster card as a token to access the system,” Cubic strategy manager David Roat says. […] The facial recognition system would work in a similar way to the palm vein scanner: You register your face as your ticket, then cameras and infrared sensors at the gate detect you when you pass through and charge your payment account. The use of infrared sensors means the system couldn’t be fooled by a 2D image. (Source)
According to an article in The Guardian, the start-up company Evolv Technology is pilot testing high-speed body scanners at the Los Angeles’s Union Station, Union Station in D.C., and the Denver international airport.
Evolv has taken a page right out of the TSA playbook citing safety concerns and fears of terror to justify their usage.
Evolv CEO Michael Ellonbogen said, “I think we need to change our entire take on physical security and knit it into the flow of our daily lives”. “It’s an unfortunate trend, but physical security is morphing and the problem is worsening”, said Lux Capital’s Bilal. (Source)
Corporations are using Americans fears of terror to make huge profits.
Evolv stands to make hundreds of millions of dollars if commuter train stations install their body scanners. A single scanner will cost taxpayers $60,000, while Bill Gates who helped fund Evolv Technology makes a nice profit.
Police use our fears of terror to justify losing of our rights
An LA Times article served as a mouthpiece to justify more government spying.
“While we’ll never become a fully secured environment like you’d have in the airport, we do want to find a way to more effectively screen passengers,” Metro security executive Alex Wiggins said. “We are trying to stay ahead of the threat.”
Mr. Wiggins isn’t done scaring the public just yet…
“Transportation is a very soft and attractive target,” said Wiggins,“Given the recent large-scale attacks at transit facilities in Europe, we need to see if there is technology that can screen large number of peoples and focus in on weapons and explosives.” (Source)
Curiously, the LA Times devoted only one sentence to privacy concerns.
Three months ago, I warned everyone that California Transit Authorities have a history of using corporate surveillance technology to spy on commuters.
A class action lawsuit in California revealed that Transit Police are using a ‘Bart Watch’ app and Stingray surveillance to allegedly spy on commuters texts and emails.
Let’s make one thing perfectly clear: the war on terror is a for-profit business being led by private corporations and DHS. (The TSA is part of DHS.)
To learn more, I recommend checking out Gary Jacobucci’s article that asked if, ‘DHS is a private offshore corporation.‘ Here are two companies that appear to be fronts for DHS: Homeland Security Solutions and Homeland Security Corporation. (Click here & here to find out more.)
Body scanners use government watchlists
Evolv uses ‘Known Wolves’, watchlist software that can identify people of interest or anyone on a government watchlist.
Stay on constant lookout for known wolves and other watchlist individuals using proven facial recognition and human IQ. Integrated video camera provides positive ID for alarm resolution. Send notifications and alerts to mobile team or operations center. (Source)
Getting the public to accept facial recognition body scanners at airports and Disney World is only part of a much greater privacy nightmare.
Evolv’s facial recognition body scanners are being used at public area screenings, sporting events, and employee screenings.
Retail stores and conference centers are also using facial biometric cameras and scanners.
Imagine a future where the police use government watchlists, facial biometric scanners, Stingray cellphone surveillance, Bluetooth, and license plate readers to spy on our every movement.
This is our future unless we fight for our privacy rights.

"World Cup 2018: Argentina, Portugal, Panama qualify; USA, Chile out","""I told the group: Messi did not owe the World Cup to Argentina, but football owed the World Cup to Messi.""
Coach Jorge Sampaoli was speaking after a Lionel Messi hat-trick against Ecuador - the 44th of his career - ensured Argentina survived a scare to reach the World Cup finals.
The 2014 runners-up began the day sixth in the group, knowing only a top-four place would see them qualify automatically for Russia.
They made a terrible start in Quito, conceding inside 38 seconds, but the Barcelona superstar led Argentina's fight back to ensure they secured their place in next year's tournament.
It was part of a remarkable night of football that saw:
Panama qualify for their first World Cup with a controversial goal in a 2-1 win over Costa Rica

Argentina
Argentina fans celebrated following their qualification for the World Cup in 2018
Messi said it would have been ""crazy"" had Argentina not qualified for Russia 2018, but it took his intervention to ensure they reached their 12th consecutive World Cup.
Ecuador scored in the first minute, taking advantage of Argentina's hesitancy, before Messi struck twice before half-time to calm some nerves.
His third, a lofted chip over goalkeeper Maximo Banguera, saw his country win for the first time in the Ecuadorian capital since 2001 and, crucially, reach next year's World Cup.
Sampaoli warned against Argentina depending too much on Messi - despite it being a remarkable 11 months since any other Argentina player scored for the national team in a World Cup qualifier.
""Today, luckily, the nationality of the best player in the world is Argentinean,"" Sampaoli continued.
""We must be sure everything does not depend on Leo but today he brought his great ability. I told the group we should help him be in the World Cup.""

Panama
Nestled between Kuwait and Moldova as the world's 131st most populous nation, Panama's biggest football achievement up until Tuesday evening was finishing as runner-up in the 2013 Gold Cup.
Now, they have reached their first World Cup - but it was not without controversy, because the Gabriel Torres' header that drew Panama level with Costa Rica did not appear to cross the line.
Despite furious complaints from the visitors, the goal stood, and Roman Torres struck in the final few minutes to send Panama through.
It was a neat reversal of fortunes for Panama, who missed out on qualifying for the last World Cup after conceding two goals in stoppage time against the US in 2013.
This time, though, it was their 87th-minute winner that ensured their place in Russia - at the expense of the US.
President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela declared a national holiday following their victory
United States
In contrast to Panama, the United States has a population of 323.1 million. Their opponents on Tuesday, Trinidad and Tobago, have a population of 1.3m - roughly the same as the US state of Maine.
Described as the ""most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history"" and ""simply devastating"" by American journalists, the players were left in tears following their shock 2-1 loss.
""It's a blemish for us. We should not be staying at home for this World Cup and I take responsibility,"" coach Bruce Arena said of a team ranked 28th in the world.
""We failed on the day. No excuses. We failed today. We should have walked off this field with at least a point.""
This is the first time the US have failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1986
Journalist Alicia Jessop drew parallels with the national women's team
Captain Michael Bradley described the night as the ""perfect storm"".
""Everything that could have possibly gone wrong did, in this stadium and in two other stadiums across the [Concacaf] region,"" he added.
""To give away the first goal like that [an own goal] is a killer. But the reality is it was all there for us, and we have nobody to blame but ourselves.""
A draw would have been enough for the United States to automatically qualify
Chile & Portugal
Brazil ended Chile's slim hopes of reaching the World Cup as their 3-0 victory pushed Alexis Sanchez and company from third to sixth in the qualifying group.
Midfielder Arturo Vidal, who missed the game through suspension, announced his retirement following the loss and tweeted that ""my soul is destroyed"".
""Thanks boys, for everything, for all these years together giving our lives in every game,"" the 30-year-old wrote.
Chile's Argentinean manager Juan Antonio Pizzi also left his post after Tuesday's disappointment.
While it was misery for Sanchez, another superstar forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, was smiling as Portugal avoided the play-offs to guarantee their fifth consecutive World Cup appearance with a 2-0 victory over Switzerland.
But the Netherlands - third in the 2014 tournament - are out, despite beating Sweden 2-0.
The Dutch needed a seven-goal win to nudge their opponents out of the play-off berth behind group winners France.

'Hair' gets a little new styling for the age of Trump,"LONDON (Reuters) - A special production of the 1960s rock musical “Hair”, tweaked for the age of Trump, premieres in London this week to mark the ground-breaking show’s 50th anniversary.
The show, staged in London’s Vaults theater, features updates to the dialogue and song lyrics written by James Rado, who wrote the show with Germoe Ragni in the 1960s, to comment on contemporary politics.
Among the updates, characters sing about making “America stronger,” - a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan. The new production also features new scenes and other dialogue.
“I think what Jim (Rado) wanted to do was just make it a little bit more apparent and clear that America and other Western countries, including Britain, haven’t necessarily moved forward as quickly as we’d hoped,” director Jonathan O‘Boyle, told Reuters.
“Hair” follows the fortunes of The Tribe - a group of hippies fighting conscription into the Vietnam war in 1960s New York.
Cast members perform during a rehearsal of Hair at The Vaults theatre in London, Britain, October 10, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay
It was highly controversial upon its first release for its full-frontal nudity, liberal depiction of drug taking and irreverent treatment of the American flag, which was displayed up-side down and laid on the floor.
The show had lengthy runs on Broadway and on London’s West End, and songs like “Aquarius” and “Good Morning Starshine” helped the original Broadway cast recording sell almost three million copies.
Slideshow (7 Images)
Despite the social and political changes since the show’s creation, its themes of racism, fears of nuclear war - and it’s irreverent treatment of the American flag - mean that is still relevant to the current political discussion.
“Everything that hippies were fighting for then, is still needing to be fought for today,” said Andy Coxon, who plays hippy George Berger. “You’d be surprised how much things haven’t changed. A lot has, we still have a way to go.”
And would the U.S. president himself, currently embroiled in a row over American football players kneeling during the playing of the national anthem in protest, approve of the show?
“He’d probably hate it,” said O‘Boyle."

Refuse Fascism is the project of a group that has received funding from organizations linked to George Soros and they have put a call-to-action on their website demanding the overthrow of the “Trump/Pence regime” set to begin on November 4th.
“Every force and faction in the power structure would be forced to respond to our demand,” the call-to-action post reads. “The cracks and divisions among the powers already evident today will sharpen and widen. As we draw more and more people forward to stand up, all of this could lead to a situation where this illegitimate regime is removed from power.”
How will they achieve their coup d’etat? By gathering .. or something.
We will gather in the streets and public squares of cities and towns across this country, at first many thousands declaring that this whole regime is illegitimate and that we will not stop until our single demand is met: This Nightmare Must End: the Trump/Pence Regime Must Go!
Antifa has taken the Refuse Fascism call seriously. Last Tuesday, they blocked traffic on the 101 freeway in Los Angeles to hold up signs spelling out “Nov 4 It Begins” while chanting “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.”
The website has pre-planned banners, leaflets, graphics and posters for the event that is to start on November 4, just three days before the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, and go until the Trump administration is thrown from power.
So it begs the question, who is Refuse Fascism?
According to a fundraiser on CrowdRise.com, the project’s website RefuseFascism.org is run by the Alliance for Global Justice.
According to a report by The Daily Caller, AFGJ received money from several progressive organizations with George Soros’ Tides Foundation being one of the largest givers.
According to its most recent 990 tax form, Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ) received $2.2 million in funding for the fiscal year ending in March 2016. One of the group’s biggest donors is the Tides Foundation, a non-profit funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist George Soros. Tides gave AfGJ $50,000. The United Steel Workers labor union also contributed $5,000. The city of Tucson is also listed in AfGJ’s 990 as a donor, but a city official says that the city acted merely as a pass-through for a Native American tribe that provided a grant to the activist group. The city official said that no city money went to AfGJ. Charities associated with several major corporations also donated. Patagonia.org, the outdoor apparel and equipment company, gave $40,000. The Ben & Jerry Foundation, the charity associated with the ice cream maker, gave $20,000. And Lush Cosmetic gave $43,950. Another bit of irony is seen in the $5,000 contribution from the Peace Development Fund, a group that claims to support organizations that fight for human rights and social justice. Another major donation came from a group that was chaired by Hillary Clinton during the 1980s. The New World Foundation gave $52,000 to AfGJ.
The current Crowdrise campaign has raised $135,000 of their $175,000 goal specifically for the Nov. 4 revolution.

'Dynasty' review: CW revival new bang for bucks,"(CNN) After extensive dabbling in the world of superheroes, the CW plunges back into the super-rich and super-soapy with ""Dynasty."" Seemingly determined to out-sleaze ""Gossip Girl,"" the catfight-heavy premiere largely delivers on that level, with the disclaimer that sustaining such serialized ""Can you top that?"" silliness is where the producers will have to earn their keep.
If TNT's ""Dallas"" revival built upon the original and its characters, ""Dynasty"" -- overseen by the producers of ""Gossip Girl"" -- has essentially borrowed the name of Aaron Spelling's original the-rich-are-like-us-only-crazier drama and spruced it up for modern times.
At the show's core there's still Blake Carrington (Grant Show) and his massive energy company and estate, which his ambitious, scheming daughter Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies) assumes is eventually going to be hers.
Those plans, alas, are thrown for a loop when Blake reveals that he's engaged to one of his employees, Cristal (Nathalie Kelley). Fallon dismisses her with a constant barrage of sniping, thus lending credence to Cristal's complaint that Blake's kids won't see her as anything more than ""the girl you're banging.""
There's a lot of banging and big bucks all around, naturally, with Fallon dallying with the family chauffeur (Robert Christopher Riley), and her brother Steven (James Mackay) -- among network TV's first gay characters on the original -- allowed to be himself more openly, while his promotion of environmental causes has created a rift with Blake.

How did you get over Game 2?
Truth be told, I struggled. I was up by 6:00 a.m. on Saturday morning and tuned into WFAN as I drove my daughter to meet her high school cross country team. The first words I heard was, “Why didn’t he at least challenge?” I fell asleep to those words as many of you might have as well.
In his book, Wait, What and Life’s Other Essential Questions, James Ryan challenges us to think deeply about asking and answering questions. “The wait that precedes the what could be seen as just a useless rhetorical tic. But I think it’s crucial because it reminds you (and others) to slow down to make sure you truly understand. Too often we fail to pause for clarification, thinking that we understand something before we do. In doing so, we miss the opportunity to grasp full significance of an idea, an assertion, or an event. Asking, “Wait, what?” is a good way to capture, rather than miss, those opportunities.”

I said to myself as the pitch “hit” Lonnie Chisenhall on Friday night, “He’s gunna challenge.” And when Joe Girardi didn’t, I said, “Wait, what?” I’m curious why Girardi didn’t do the same given that both his catcher, Gary Sanchez, and bench player, Chase Headley pointed out the inaccuracy of the umpire’s call on the field. Why didn’t he just take their word for it? Why didn’t he say as Ryan suggests, “Wait, what?”
Source: David Dermer/AP
Ryan suggests in his third essential question, “Couldn’t we at least…” “Joe, couldn’t we at least challenge?” Even if we didn’t get confirmation, even if we have a chance of being wrong, we still had one more challenge. Why didn’t we exercise our one of two right then and there?
As I told the many people I encountered both in person and online, “I am depressed.” I told one person that I think I cried this morning while listening to WFAN. I didn’t have a good workout. I didn’t have good focus at the grocery story, spending way more than I should of. I didn’t have a good day. And I am still not over it as we head into tonight’s game. At one point I told a fan, “We should clear out all of the leadership in the clubhouse and start anew.” That fan said, “You’re the GM. Who then?” I’d hire a search firm, much like organizations do when they seek new leadership. I’d fire Joe Girardi after this series and open a search. We can’t live like this anymore. I can’t live like this anymore.
Source: David Richard/USA Today Sports, via Reuters
Another side of “Couldn’t we at least…” is that why did it take so long for Girardi to admit he made a mistake? He first said he didn’t want to break Chad Green‘s rhythm with the delay of a challenge. Then he said we didn’t get confirmation quick enough. It wasn’t until today that Girardi admitted his mistake. “I screwed up,” Girardi said in a news conference Saturday. “It’s hard. It’s a hard day for me. But I’ve got to move forward, and we’ll be ready to go tomorrow,” reported ESPN.
Source: David Dermer/Associated Press
I am trying to remain positive and say, “Wait, what? We have one more game to play at the very least. Couldn’t we at least give it everything we have?” I believe the Yankees will but the door is being held open by a very weak door stopper. The Bombers will have to leave it all on the field. They will have to give it their all because there may not be a tomorrow for the Yankees in 2017.
As a wise colleague said to me via Twitter, “A famous man once said “It isn’t over until its over.” For God’s sake, I hope he’s right.

Sen. Rubio: Remove communist US soldier from officer ranks,"U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio is calling for an apparent pro-communist U.S. soldier to lose his commission as an officer.
In a letter to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, the Florida Republican says the Pentagon should remove 2nd Lt. Spenser Rapone from officer ranks while pursuing disciplinary action against the 2016 U.S. Military Academy graduate.
Rubio also says West Point should consider revoking Rapone's four-year degree.
Rapone has been in the spotlight since he recently posted photos of himself on Twitter wearing a T-shirt featuring Marxist Che Guevara under his West Point uniform and holding his cap with the words ""communism will win"" written on the underside.
Army officials say they're looking into the actions by Rapone, an infantry officer with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum in northern New York."
Exclusive: Alphabet's Waymo demanded $1 billion in settlement talks with Uber - sources,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Waymo sought at least $1 billion in damages and a public apology from Uber Technologies Inc as conditions for settling its high-profile trade secret lawsuit against the ride-services company, sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters.
The Waymo self-driving car unit also asked that an independent monitor be appointed to ensure Uber does not use Waymo technology in the future, the sources said.
Uber rejected those terms as non-starters, said the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss settlement talks. The precise dollar amount requested by Waymo and the exact time the offer was made could not be learned.
Waymo’s tough negotiating stance, which has not been previously reported, reflects the company’s confidence in its legal position after months of pretrial victories in a case which may help to determine who emerges in the forefront of the fast-growing field of self-driving cars.
The aggressive settlement demands also suggest that Waymo is not in a hurry to resolve the lawsuit, in part because of its value as a distraction for Uber leadership, said Elizabeth Rowe, a trade secret expert at the University of Florida Levin College of Law.
Waymo recently persuaded a San Francisco federal judge to delay a trial to decide the dispute from October to early December, citing the need to investigate evidence Uber had not disclosed earlier.
No further settlement talks are currently scheduled, the sources said. The judge overseeing the case mandated that the companies enter mediation with a court-appointed magistrate.
Amy Candido, a Waymo attorney, declined to comment on any settlement talks, but said the company’s reasons for suing Uber are “pretty clear.”
“Waymo had one goal: to stop Uber from using its trade secrets,” she said. “That remains its goal.”
An Uber spokesperson declined to comment.
DISRUPTIVE
Waymo sued Uber in February, claiming that former engineer Anthony Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving to set up a self-driving truck company, called Otto, which Uber acquired soon after.
Uber denied using any of Waymo’s trade secrets.

Waymo’s lawsuit has been disruptive for Uber. U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted Waymo’s request for a pretrial injunction in May, which prohibited Levandowski from working on Lidar, a key sensor technology for self-driving cars that is the crux of the current litigation.
Uber later fired Levandowski, regarded as a visionary in autonomous technology, after he refused to return Waymo documents at the heart of the case. Levandowski has asserted his constitutional right against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions from Waymo lawyers.
Meanwhile, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick stepped down as chief executive in June after allegations of widespread misconduct at the company became public. Kalanick has since become embroiled in a boardroom fight with fellow Uber investor Benchmark Capital.
Benchmark cited Waymo’s allegations of trade secret theft in separate litigation aimed at forcing Kalanick off Uber’s board. A Delaware judge put that lawsuit on hold and sent it to private arbitration.
On Sunday Oct. 1, the day before Kalanick was scheduled to give a deposition in the Waymo case, Kalanick’s lawyers called Waymo and asked to postpone the deposition, lawyers for both companies said in court last week.
Kalanick’s lawyers said he was in the middle of a fight to appoint new board members and was therefore too busy, Waymo attorneys said in court. Waymo refused the request, forcing Kalanick to attend the deposition.
DISTRACTING A COMPETITOR
Causing such distractions for a competitor are a clear benefit to Waymo, Rowe said. Uber has hired three law firms to litigate the case and devoted thousands of hours to probe Uber servers for Waymo confidential information.
“I‘m counting all those as good reasons to keep the lawsuit going,” Rowe said.
Waymo has estimated damages in the case at about $1.9 billion, according to court filings, which Uber disputes. Despite that figure and the big settlement demands, Waymo views winning a permanent injunction against Uber using any Waymo intellectual property as the main priority, another source familiar with the company’s thinking said.
Much of the technical evidence in the case has been filed under seal, making it impossible for outside observers to independently assess the strength of each side's arguments. In court last week, Alsup said Uber's product was ""dissimilar"" from Waymo's.
Even if a jury finds that Uber stole Waymo trade secrets, Uber says in court filings that its engineers have designed around the Waymo technology at issue in the case. If that is true, that would lessen the impact on Uber in the event of a defeat in court.
Waymo is skeptical of Uber’s claim, however. In a court filing on Monday, it requested an order forcing Uber to disclose its source code, or underlying software, for its Lidar products.
The Alphabet subsidiary said in the filing that it recently learned that former employees took Waymo source code when they went to work at Uber, “including software related to the ‘brains’ of the vehicle that determines how the car moves.”"

The liberal mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Carmen Cruz, this week turned the massive recovery effort in her state into a political opportunity.
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
Cruz said on Friday that she wanted to “make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives” after FEMA asked her to list her priorities so that they could properly direct aid. Her response is as expected from a progressive – a politically motivated, irresponsible display of someone with the inability to lead.
“Well, where have you been?” she exclaimed. “I have been very respectful of the FEMA employees. I have been patient but we have no time for patience anymore.” Although it is unclear how impatience helps considering the scope of the disaster due to the failure of local and state government to upgrade the infrastructure on the island in decades past.
President Donald Trump responded to Cruz, pointing out her lack of leadership.
“Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,” he tweeted. The president pointed out that leaders like Cruz pound their desks and demand action instead of getting out into the community and encouraging it.
This kind of language has a negative effect on the community and the 10,000 federal and military members in the territory. It is important to encourage locals to get out and help with the recovery as many did when Hurricane Harvey submerged much of Houston, Texas. Vitriolic criticism is demoralizing and her comments are in direct opposition to the territory’s Governor who clearly understands that encouragement and hopefulness are more helpful than dramatic, desperate rants on television.
“We’re very pleased with the communication with the president, with the administration…we’re working as one team,” Governor Ricardo Rossello told CBS News.
The Trump administration’s latest action, waiving the Jones Act, came just hours after Puerto Rico’s governor requested it. While the waiver won’t improve the aid effort, it shows the responsiveness of the federal government to Puerto Rico’s needs.

President Donald Trump recently met with Democrat leaders in an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare since his own party wouldn’t do it after saying they would for seven years if given the house, senate, and presidency. The American people voted them in and they voted it down thanks to the likes of RINO never-Trumpers Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and John McCain. I don’t blame him for trying to appeal to the other side in this instance, but I don’t think he would meet with much success there since it is their own plan and they don’t want changes so like in most cases he’ll do it himself and next week is expected to roll back some Obamacare requirements. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order next week to start lifting some insurance rules set by his predecessor’s Affordable Care Act in the aftermath of the failed Republican bid to repeal the law, a senior administration official said Saturday. The order is aimed at expanding insurance options for Americans who buy coverage on their own or work for a small employer, and would include broad instructions for agencies to explore ways to loosen regulations and potentially lower premiums, as …
